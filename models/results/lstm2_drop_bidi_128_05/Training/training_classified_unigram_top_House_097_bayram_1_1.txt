aside the primary duty of the congress in acting upon the defense authorization measure is to provide for the common defense in the most costeffective manner for the taxpaying public the major questions before us ought to be what is our military need and what is the best way of balancing defense capabilities with costs to meet that need in my opinion the facts most relevant to these central issues are first almost all parties who have seriously examined the subjectinctluding both congressional armed services committeesconclude that the united states is faced with a severe shortage of military airlift particularly in the field of outsize cargo such as helicopters tanks armored fighting vehicles and artillery second under every likely military scenario the proposed c5b fleet would deliver more combat power than the b747 in the critical first 20 days of an emergency and because of its outsize cargo capabilities the c5b would afford far more flexibility to defense planners in responding to changing circumstances third with regard to cost effectiveness the air force has concluded that the 20year lifecycle expenses of a comparable fleet of c5bs and b747s yields a cost advantage to the latter of less than 1 billion furthermore the c5b fleet was found to be 25 percent more effective which reflects in part the fact that the 747 fleet would in the words of general hecker do nothing to alleviate the current and pressing need for outsize airlift capability fourth finally during the present period of maximum budget austerity the b747 procurement would cost 2 billion more over the next 3 years than would the c5b in summary the c5b would respond more adequately to the actual military requirement for outsize cargo airlift with only a marginal cost penalty in the long run and a sizable cost advantage in the near term none of this is meant to disparage the 747 nor to downplay the contribution that it can make toward meeting our national defense mobility

that the house of representatives and the congress is the institution it now is in large measure because of his never ending pursuit of democratic principles and procedures to serve it he has also indeed had an exceptional influence on the development of the democratic party both as a team player on the rules committee and as a student of the congress dick bolling is a man who likes to take on the tough issues the civil rights act of 1964 serves as an early example of this principle many of us now in this chamber were just getting started in politics in those days and it is with great admiration that i recall how truly enormous was the effort it took to enact national legislation of such stature in those days another toughissue was committee reform and the opening of the process to every member sometimes at the expense of those who had already achieved an important position some early chapters on the bolling committee as we call it and its work to modernize the house and bring the work of its several committees into better balance have already been written the committee on science and technology which i am privileged to chair is one of the many beneficiaries of the painstaking efforts led by dick bolling as a result of his efforts the house did give responsibility for civilian research and ievelopment to one committee and thus equipped itself to deal with one of the key issues on our national agenda the role of science and technology and the contributions which can be made by that sector to increased innovation and productivity in addition as a key figure on the rules committee for many years and more recently as its chairman he has been instrumental in seeing that the referral mechanisms put in place by house resolution 988 were properly and fairly adhered to the product of this stewardship has been better legislation and it would not have been possible without dick bolling equally tough to grapple with has been the tying together in the congress of the spending side with the requirement to levy taxes the 1974 budget and improvement control act bears his stamp and is in large measure the product of his foresight since the implementation of the act is still a matter of relative newness the full impact of the goals and procedures it establishes is very much in the center of todays political arena the linkage of spending

world peace then we have to demonstrate to them and to other nations a strong effective commril ment to the goals of the nuclear freeze movement we must demonstrate that as a government we understand that thre is no level of nuclear weapons buildup that will provide lasting security or enduring deterence we must recognize that whenever we increase our nuclear weapons stockpile to the point where

for energy policy in the hands of individual decisionmakers operating in the marketplace since the president has been in office he has initiated a number of actions consistent with his goal of strengthening reliance on the private sector to meet our energy needs for example price and allocation controls on crude oil and petroleum products have been lifted regulatory impediments to coal

rise in support of the latta substitute budget resolution before discussing the specific details of this proposal however i would like to talk for a moment about the economy and the overall budget process thure is no question that our nations economy is currently suffering from a variety of serious probleis par too many americans who want to work are unemployed aftertax corporate profits declined 17 5 percent during the first quarter of 1982 1wominal interest rates remain at excessive lbvels while real interest rates are at historic highs largely as a result of our recent successes on the inflation front those sections of the economy which are particularly interest sensitive such as housing and automobiles are at neardepression levels as was pointed out during our recent debate ort the net worth assistance act 80 percent of our thrift institutions lost money in 1981 if anything conditions are worse now i make these observations not to assign blame for the condition of our economyand in this regard i specifically object to claims that the presidents program which took effect last october 1 is responsible for a recession that had its beginnihgs in 1979 and which begain in earnest last julybut to underscore the importance of the debate we are now engaged in and the actions we are about to take quite simply the american people expect congress to act expeditiously responsibility and in the best national interest in adopting a budget resolution that can contribute to economic recovery unfortunately the congressional budget process has shown increasing signs of disarray particularly over the past several months our performance 2 weeks ago contributed greatly to the perception that we are unable to take meaningful action given the inability of the house the senate and the administratlon to achieve even the slightest agreement on the parameters and priorities defining the 1983 budget it is hardly surprising that the financial markets remain unconvinced that real progress will be made in reducing the deficit and the growth of federal spending it is of course generally accepted that the size of our projected deficits as well as the belief that spending is not really under control that are the most important reasons for the persistence of high interest rates i am well aware that every member has his or her own preferences as to the most appropriate content for the fiscal year 1983 budget we have different interests objectives and priorities we represent widely varying geographical areas and constituencies yet it we refuse to compromise if we continue to allow partisan differences to blind us to the urgent need for budgetary certainty economic recovery will remain elusive if we each r 3352 jime 10 1982 insist upon our own budget preferences the american people will be the ultimate losers in a very real sense we are all in this together and i would suggest that it is past time that we got down to the business of adopting a fiscal year 1983 bux et that can provide a ray of hope for our farmers small businessmen unemployed construction and auto workers our senior citizens and all others who look to congress to display leaderihip it is clear that only a budget proposal with broad appeal one that is basically consistent with the views of members with varying philosophies can be effectively implemented in contrast to the proposal drafted by chairman jones the latta subsitute best satisfies this requirement and if enacted will best assure that we move toward resolution of our economic problems the jones substitute unfortunately appears based on the assumption that the taxandspend policies of the pastthe policies whereby the federal government consumes an ever greater share of the gnp each year and which under president carter led to unprecedented inflation and interest ratesmust be reinstated when president carter took office federal tax receipts totalled 18 5 percent of onp by 1980 this rate had grown to 21 percent a level unmatched since world war ii president reagans personal income and business tax reductions enacted last summer were intended to reverse this trend and to allow the productive businesses and workers of our country to save and invest a greater percentage of their earnings yet even with the economic recovery tax act taxes as a percentage of gnp will decline to only 19 1 percent by 1985 in essence most taxpayers even with the reagan tax cuts will do little more than break even over this period because of the effects of bracket creep and rising social security taxes i find it extremely difficult to believe therefore that a majority member of the budget cominittee has actually voiced the view that americans are fundamentally undertaxed implicitly adopting this view the jones substitute provides for tax increases totaling 150 billion over the next 3 years when coupled with the social security tax increases presently legislated this total rises to 262 billion i personally feel that if anything americans are fundamentally overtaxed and that particularly during the current recession we should not be contemplating tax increases of any sqrt in other words we should not attempt to reduce the deficit throigh revenue increasesespecially since much of the present deficit is the result ironically of lower than anticipated inflation as well as the recession in this regard i am certainly not pleased with the tax increases contained in the latta substitute although they are more than 50 billion less than jones over the 3year period i am also concerned with the manner in which our essential defense expenditures are treated by the jones proposal although i too have expressed the belief that reasonable and prudent reductions can perhaps be made in defense expenditures the jones substitute goes too far in providing for 21 billion less in outlays over the next 3 years than does latta our constituents understand that we must assure that above all else our national security needs must be met most polls of which i am aware show overwhelming support for adequate defense spending in 1961 when president kennedy took office defense consumed nearly 50 percent of the federal budget while human resources programs were allocated a little more than 25 pertent by 1980 those figures had been reversed more than 50 percent of the budget went to human resource programs while only 23 6 percent was spent on defense the need for an improvement in our defense capability cannot be overstated in meeting legitimate domestic problems over the past 20 years we have neglected the fact that the united states exists within a hostile world and that we must be ever vigilant in the protection of our freedoms the lxtta substitute reduces the presidents proposed defense expenditures by more than 35 billion over the next 3 years the jones substitute makes more than 20 billion further in cuts we should certainly spend no more than necessary for our national security unfortunately under the budget resolution written by chairman jones we do not spend enough the jones substitute while providing for excessive revenue increases and defense reductions does not go far enough in terms of discretionary spending and entitlements savings in fact chairman jones has accepted less than half of the presidents recommendations in this regard again the latta substitute is distinctly superior as i mentioned a moment ago it is essential if we are to progress on our economic problems that we enact a responsible budget it seems almost as if the entire financial community is unable and unwilling to move until we in congress act we must therefore put aside our partisan differences we must continue to reject the bankrupt taxing and spending policies of the past i am not happy with the fiscal year 1983 deficit projections contained in either the latta or the jones substitute i would prefer a substantially lower target i am nothappy with the need to increase taxes i am not happy that we are unable to identify additional spending reductions i am nevertheless prepared to support a budget resolution with which i do not totally agree

rise in strong support of these interim amendments i do urge the distinguished chairman the gentleman from texas to continue to give his full attention to this serious problem of the method by which we send cases to the administrative law judge level the review of disability cases currently underway should not cause undue hardship to those innocent elderly who are truly deserving and disabled it was in 1980 before i was a member of this distinguished body that the congress enacted the disability amendments of 1980 which mandated periodic review of disability determinations and it was president carter and the secretary of hew joseph califano who asked for the weeding out of those who were abusing the system last year congress had presented to us a gao report which found that an alarming 2 billion was being handed out each year to people who were no longer disabled this week another studys findings were released indicating that this figure may well be as high as 4 billion each year over half of this abuse is occurring because beneficiaries did not report the fact that they had returned to work or that their condition had improved certainly it is important to decrease this abuse so that benefits for those truly deserving can be protected however it has become clear that in a large number of cases elderly and disabled individuals have undergone severe hardship when their benefits have been discontinued unjustly often benefits are stopped abruptly while it may be 12 to 18 months before benefits can be restored through the appeal process despite the difficulties for the disabled that have occurred because of this steppedup review process there has been a problem getting action on this issue by the ways and means social security subcommittee in the house i commend the chairman of the subcommittee mr pickle for the sensible interim approach his subcommittee has taken on this issue with h r 7093 although this compromise does not represent a longterm solution to the problems of the continuing disability investigation program allowing recipients to continue to draw benefits while they appeal their review decision to the administrative law judge

in their accounting tables for overhead for benefits and for other operating expenses the epas comptroller then uses the figure of 45 000 per position thus according to epas comptroller roughly half or 153 positions would be funded by the committees action however the committee also did not take into account an anticipated pay raise not to make up for inflation not nearly that much but a small pay raise to 8 645 fulltime slots that is the omb ceiling for fiscal year 1983 which will cost approximately 10 8 million what the committee assumes is that this additional cost will be funded through a supplemental but last year epa reprogramed 15 million out of the r d budget to cover this expense additionally in order to meet ombs personnel ceilings for fiscal year 1983 epa anticipates rifing 300 to 400 personnel again the estimate on the cost of a rif per person is from 10 000 to 12 000 per rif this requires another 3 6 million out of the salaries and expenses account so when you add it

enforcement of these cases because we do not have the people are we going to reply well that is just too bad we cannot do anything about it or are we going to say we will solve that problem i had a

up to us i say to my colleagues what direction are we going to take what i am proposing in this amendment is that we bring it up within the budget resolution to the fiscal year 1982 levels it does not even account for the ravages of inflation on the ability of this office to do its work but let us at least bring it up to the 1982 levels and stay within the budget resolution let us not slash it

increased federal allocation amount goes from 336 million to 361 million which is of course the exact provisions of the bill that we are now addressing the fiscal year 1981 shortfall is not an isolated occurrence a similar shortfall of 13 1 million occurred in fiscal year 1980 and was paid by the district of columbia subsequently the board was invited by the district to participate in the fiscal year 1982 amended budget process the boards actuary estimated that an additional 14 5 million of payments of the funds should be made for fiscal year 1982 the amount was included in the fiscal year 1982 amended budget at the districts request and is now being paid by the district of columbia government on a quarterly basis the districts conduct in 1980 and 1982 ackiowledged that the methodology and the data base for determining payments to the funds had not yet been brought into the kind of alinement which the statute adopted by this congress anticipated would provide the necessary annual contribution by the district which together with the employee contributions would make the actual benefit payments in the opinion of the retirement boards actuary the fiscal year 1981 shortfall is attributable to basically two factors first the unitedstates treasury departments actuarial calculations were based upon data provided at that time by the district regarding individual members and individual beneficiaries this data very simply was deficient and proved to be inadequate second in order to project required district payments under the statutory formula the actuary must make assumptions regarding future cost of living increases salary increases rates of mortality disability and termination of employment the number of new employees and their age sex and salary rates and other matters which is of course impossible to prbject exactly it is therefore the purpose of this amendment to require that the 14 3 million which is the existing shortfall be set aside to make up for a clearly anticipated shortfall which could have been rectified in the normal budget process of the city but has not been so done the amendment that i have before the house would correct this situation it would provide for a mandatory payment in accordance with existing law previously adopted by this congress now let me make several additional points if i might this is not a matter of home

state and volunteer efforts to preserve the camden area i am advised that the local people have invested about 1 5 million already and this small contribution by the department of the interior would

569 and urge my colleagues to allow a separate vote on provisions of the conference report requiring the 10 percent withholding on interest and dividend earnings despite many of the much needed reforms in h r 4961 there are many other very bad provisions the 10 percent withholding provisions on interest and dividends remain particularly troublesome and will only result in unnecessary cost and paperwork burdens on financial institutions and corporations as many members have expressed their deepest concern with regard to these provisions i believe that failure to provide for a separate vote on the withholding provisions could prove fatal to final passage of this bill as our colleague from new hampshire hon nonman damouns has so aptly stated withholding is overkill it is not withholding that is needed to insure taxpayer compliance but rather better use of information on interest and dividends much of which is already provided on 1099 forms taxpayer compliance with regard to dividend and interest reporting is already remarkably high at a 96 7 percent compliance rate the provisions outlined in h r 4961 will only result in a nominal increase in compliance but at the same time will require millions of new forms to be processed while creating clearly unreasonable paperwork i regret that the real impact of the 10 percent withholding provisions will not come from better compliance but rather from speeding up collections by the irs many taxpayers however already have more than their fair share of taxes withheld from income during the tax year requiring withholding on dividend and interest will only complicate this matter further resulting in the federal government holding more than its share from taxpayers and requiring larger refunds to individuals at the end of the year clearly the projected revenue gain resulting from instituting these provisions is overstated and illusory in conclusion the interest and dividend withholding provisions are an extremely

mechanical count showing the number of construction jobs the number of permanent jobs the amount of barge traffic the amount of revenues that might be generated by the completion of a project of this sort or even if they come up with an artificially contrived costbenefit ratio demonstrating that this might be a viable idea i would submit to this house that all of those conclusions about the worthiness of projects based on that sort of reasoning employ singleentry bookkeeping employ ony a partial account of what the real economics are what the real impact is of going ahead with a project

to the equation if you want to come to a valid judgment as to whether or not it is viable to go ahead r think the first thing that we have to recognize with a massive multibilliondollar project of this sort is that some of the jobs that will be created on construction and permanently some of the economic activity that will be generated by this project does not represent a net gain to the national economy in addition to the gnp it simply represents a shift a reallocation of reactivity away from other areas other industries other transportation systems other parts of the county somne of the barge traffic is going to displace normal traffic that would otherwise occur some of the barge traffc is going to displace other traffic that otherwise would move down other waterway systems the

diminishing the economic activity that surrounds existing complexes today now the other point is never looked at that you have to count the opportunity costs of applying 1 billion or 3 billion worth of capital over a decade period or longer which this project would do because it seems to me that if you spend 3 billion to build this kind of new transportation system or transportation complex then that money is not going to be available to build steel plants to build new auto plants that this country needs to build synfuels plants this country is going to need over the next decade and i would

history will record this first session of this congress as one of the most significant farreaching legislative sessions of this century by actions taken this year this congress has begun a redirection of our national government in many cases the changes wrought will restore to individual citizens and families a measure of control over their lives and pocketbooks which had been surrendered to a federal government grown too expensive too expansive and too burdensome in other instnces the new direction will begin the necessary revitalization of our national defense and restoration of a strong

the congress of course only reflects the concern of the people of new york and the rest of the united states it also is true that congress in this first session has reflected the national will and desire for a meaningful ch ange from business as usual in washington at his inaugural in january this year president reagan called for a new beginning in midmarch he came before us in a joint session of congress to lay out a fourpoint economic recovery plan to meet the challenges of that auspicious theme for his administration the programs four major elements designed to complement one another were first cutting the growth of federal spending second reduction of tax burdens third regulatory reform and fourth controlling money and credit now only 9 months later the planks of that program directly affected by congressional action are in place or soon will becofie effective in major showdowns this year with opposing elements in congress determined to derail the economic recovery plan the presidents program repeatedly prevailed much of the credit for those successes lies with the people i received hundreds of letters and phone calls from the people of the first congressional district not all supported the presidents plan in every instance but a recurrent theme running through many of those messages was it may not be perfect but the presidenits plandeserves a chance i have supported most of what the administration has proposed in its attempts to launch a new beginning those of us elected by the people are not sheep to be led by the executive branch on occasion the interests of the people of the first congressional district run counter to an administration plan in those cases i have voted or acted accordingly but for the most part the policies and programs of this administration have warranted the support i and others have given them what we have accomplished in pursuit of the presidents economic recovery plan is truly impressive we have lowered personal income taxes by 5 percent as of october 1 with additional 10 percent reductions planned for july 1981 and july 1983 those 25percent acrosstheboard reductions will mean more money for the persons who earn it to decide how to spend not some bureaucrat in washington we also have insured that for the first time the government no longer will profit from continued inflation beginning in 1986 personal income tax rates and personal deduction will be adjusted or indexed for inflation this willmean the end of the bracket creep s by which salary and wage increases onlyboosted individuals into higher tax brackets where governiment takes a larger bite december 15 1981 coi we have put into place incentives for businesses to invest in new plant and equipment in order to operate more efficiently and create new jobs we have enacted major incentives for individuals to save more money and thus help create the capital needed for investment and economic growth as well as to better provide for themselves and their families for the future we have added extra incentives for individual initiative by insuring that a farmer or small businessmans lifetime effort and investment benefits his family not the tax collector by easing the inheritance tax rates that destroy many family farms and enterprises other benefits we have enacted as part of the taxreduction plan include new deductions for couples who work reducing the marriage penalty new charitable deductions for those who do not itemize on their tax returns an increase in the amount of money that can be put into an individual retirement account ira or keogh retirement plan with persons already oovered by a pension program at work allowed for the first time to set up an ira too in order to help workers to better save arid plan for their later years i believe it is worthwhile to reassess how far we have come in improving the economy this year to understand where we are today we have to recall where we stood at this time last year tinder the last administration when jimmy carter took office in 1977 inflation was running at 4 8 percent when he left office inflation had risen to a 12 4 percient per year rate under the reagan administration inflation is down to a 9 5 percent annual rate just last month consumer price rises were holding at 4 4 percent annual rate clearly we are turning the tide on inflation and it is this lowered inflation which offers the greatest encouragement for those on fixed or low incomes who have been hurt most by the soaring inflation of recent years when jimmy carter took office in 1977 the prime interest rate was 6 25 percent when he left office it was up to a high of 21 5 percent now it is down to 15 5 percent and stilll heading downward ~when jimmy carter took office federal spending wa s increasing at a rate of 12 3 percenta year when he left off ide the spending growth rate was 14 percent the latest estimate of the growth in spending uinder the reagan administration is 10 6 percent for fiscal 1982 one area where we have not seen as much improvement is in unemployment unemployment inthe last quarter of 1980 was 7 5 percent during the same period this year it is 8 percent as regrettable as that high figuire is there are signs of hope one purpose of the reaganeconomic program is to increase savings and investment needed to create jobs during all of 1980 only 300 000 new jobs were created this year there have been 730 000 new jobs created so we are seeing some progress although clearly not enough we have begun to fulfill the mandate of the people we have cut spendingfor fiscal years198284 by 167 billion in budget authority and by 131 billion in actual budget outlays we have reduced the tax burden for fiscal 1982 from the 22 1 percent of the gross national product projected by the carter administrationto only 20 4 percent under the reagan administration what we have been doing is painful but i believe the people of the first congre ssional district

needed to operate our sophisticated modern military with its allvolunteer force our national debt to those who serve us all in the military continues after their service this year we in the house

provides medical help for the first time through the veterans administration for vietnam veterans exposed to the herbicide agent orange who developed health problems as a result the veterans disability compernsation housing and memorial benefits amendments became law in october among other provisions that law increased disability compensation for disabled veterans and their dependents or survivors by 11 8 percent effective october 1 the third measure to become law was the former prisoner of war benefits act of 1981 we in the house also passed two veterans bills which the senate now must approve one would strengthen the va medical system the other would create a variablepayment home loan program to help veterans buy houses in times of high interest rates there is one last item which i want to particularly note for the people of the first congressional district because it has the potential of overshadowing all else we have done i refer to president reagans historic peace initiative announced on november 18 at that time he issued a challenge to the soviet union a challenge not of war but of peace eacll of the four points in his plan is highly significant but the most critical is the offer to cancel the placement of new nuclear defense missiles in europe if the soviet union will dismantle the strategic missiles it already has in place targeted on western europe this is a call for the beginning of a mutual disarmament if that disarm ament can be adequately verified the strategic arms reduction talks start which president reagan called for have the potential of becoming the turning point in the worlds prospects for a true and lasting peace a peace without the threat of a nuclear holocaust the voting summary printed below represents the highlights of the

more p rofitable nionutlity businesses 2 this countrys utilities arc experiencing serious financial difficulties which if allowed to continue would have a devastating impact upon the nation and its citizens and industry dependent upon reliable electric and gas utility service as many of us know the common stocks of electric utilities are selling well below their book values and lowered bond ratings have resulted in higher interest charges that are ultimately passed on to consumers these factors have caused the utility industry as well as other concerned citizens to explore the possibilities of diversification as a means of improving the industrys financial performance and stability and contributing to the wellbeing of the nations energy resources the act was passed in 1935 to correct a series of abuses by electric and gas utility holding companies notably excessive pyramidding of corporate structures and stock watering at the time a handful of holding companies controlled virtually the entire utility business in the nation these holding companies operated in disparate parts of the country and were not subject to effective state regulation in the view of the congress the power and interstate character of these holding companies rendered state control over such abuses ineffective and required that authority over them be conferred upon the securities and exchange commission the principal purpose of the act as noted in the legislative history was to nsure effective state regulation by reorganizing these holding companies into geographically contiguous units virtually all of the questionable practices the act was designed to correct were securities and accounting ones not unique to the utility industry as such they probably would have been eliminated over time by the thennew securities act~ of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 both of which turned out to be far more effective than anticipated accounting standards and practices have improved dramatically since the mid1930s moreover the regulation of public utilities on the state level is considerably more effective today than when the act was passed since state utility laws have now evolved into~ strong comprehensive regulatory systems thus present federal and state regulation is drastically different from that of the early 1930s and there is little likelihood those problems would recur in the face of regulatory scrutiny under federal and state laws other than the act the bill allows both independent electric and gas operating companies to form exempt holding companies it also allows exempt holding companies to diversify without later being subject to arbitrary sec revocation of their exemptions the bill would apply to all electric and gas utilities with the exception of registered holding companies i recognize that there are a number of issues relating to utility diversification and the act that need to be addressed i hope introduction of this legislation will encourage early hearings on this subject earlier this year hearings on the subject of least cost energy strategies for the utility industry were held by chairman ottinoers energy conservation and power subcommittee in fact it was at a september 10 hearing of that subcommittee that i first discussed the possibility of the need for the congress to consider the impact of the act on the financial health of the utility industry subsequently i sent a questionnaire regarding the act to approximately 150 utility executives and each of the 50 statepublic service commissions in reviewing the act we must look at the likely impact of diversification on investors and consumers alike secondly one must view utility diversification in the context of the nations overall energy posture and the development of its renewable and alternative energy resources finally we should address specific questions that maybe of concern to regulators and investors alike such as whether the holding company structure with separate corporate subsidiaries for utility and nonutility businesses as providedin the bill adequately protects against cross subsidization between the utility business and the nonutility business and possible competitive effects in the marketplace particularly among small businesses i consider the financial health of the utility industry to bean important issue 1 look forward to further addressing this matter in the ensuing months for the benefit of our colleagues i would like to include in the record at this point the text of the public utility financial reform act h r 5220 a bill to amnend the public utility holding company act of 1935 to improve financial performance of electric and gas utilities by removing unnecessary regulatory impediments to the exercise of sound and prudent business judgment by utility executives be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled"],

survival the prime source of water for agricultural domestic municipal and industrial use in the great plains region is the underground system of aquifers which underlies these states as those of us who represent those states are painfully aware increasing demand upon those reserves is depleting our once plentiful supply of fresh pure groundwater it has been predicted that some areas of the great plains will have totally depleted their available groundwater supplies by the turn of the century or even sooner the implications of these dire forecasts are awesome whole areas of the country will face drastically altered conditions the impact of inadequate water supplies upon agricultural production industrial development and energy production will be staggering economic development will come to a standstill without water hydrologists and geologists have recently begun to suggest that we explore the possibility of using surface water where available to replenish the diminishing groundwater reserves in these areas these are areas of the country which have an abundance of surface water which could be used to recharge these declining aquifers i believe that this approach could offer a feasible and costeffective alternative to economic disaster we simply must take action to avoid the inevitable results of inadequate water supplies in these areas i am today iitroducing legislation along with a bipartisan group of my colleagues on the committee on interior and insular affairs from the great plains states to establish a series of groundwater recharge demonstration projects to explore the feasibility of this approach this modest program would target those areas of the worst declines and the best possibility for a successful recharge project for further testing of the concept projects would be located in the high plains states of colorado kansas nebraska new mexico oklahoma south dakota texas and wyoming an 18month planning phase would be followed by a 5year demonstration phase with positive findings and recommendations for construction of fullscale projects if the concept proves feasible i urge my colleagues to examine this legislation and to join with me and others who recognize the pressing need for an effort to devise a course of action for the future of this important food and energy producing region of our country"], [0.00010353326797485352,

advantage to alaska that they do not now have second concerning all this talk about the producers getting involved in this project i would ask is that not wonderful coming from people who by the way have usually tried to restrict producers what is in this waiver package is there precisely to allow the producers to put their money in so that the american consumer will not have to put any money in so the federal government will not have to put any money in it is to ask exxon to stop forward and take n risk on their capital and if they are wrong to lose tihe money that leads to one of the key protections that is still here that people act as if does not exist we arc in no way guaranteeing that this pipeline is about to be financed by this waiver package we hope that it is going to be

i rise in strong support of this conference report the appropriation bill for agriculture is very very important to rural america and even for our country but really i believe the most important part of this conference report is in the report language itself the gentlewoman from nebraska mentioned this the chairman has mentioned it on pages 13 and 14 where we address the surplus problem that we have in rural american farms today with agricultural products particularly grain and also dairy products we not only encourage but we strongly tell the department of agriculture to dispose of these surpluses through world markets we have not done this in the past we have been able to move along and say we will go ahead and build up these big surpluses store them as we did with dairy surpluses in the country we still have a large surplus and we are giving it away we are suggesting here that we dispose of our surpluses in world markets i think this report language itself is a most important part possibly the most important part of this conference report i am sure we are going to hear more about that the department is going to be watched very closely not only by this committee but the congress to make sure that we start working very very diligently to start disposing of our surpluses i am proud that our chairman and our ranking member worked very hard in that direction to make sure that we do dispose of those surplusesgood job"], [0.0005311667919158936, 0.4994688332080841, 0, "it comes as no great insight that we have had nuclear weapons since august 6 1945 at least it is curious that as we rouse ourselves from the sedative of detente and at long last start to rebuild our neglected military defenses widdenly in a sunburst of insight nuclear weapons and mushroom clouds become very relevant and we must freeze well you know if you freeze first and then you want to negotiate reduictions there has to be some incentive to the soviets to negotiate and anybody who has studied negotiating with the soviets understands that they have one purpose and we have another we walk in there like joe corntassel looking for an agreement we think they really want to get something that will reduce tensions whereas they approach the negotiations seeking to further the world revolution i suggest to the members that if we freeze now it is like freezing with soviet hands around our throat i would rather they put their hands down and back off and then freeze i would rather spend our time negotiating reductions and then when we reach an equilibrium freeze rather than freeze in an imbalance well you will say who says there is an imbalance i agree there is one set of experts over here there is retired adm gene la rocque who has not had access to classified material in some time and we know where he is coming from there is the godmother of the freeze movement ms randall forsberg who spent 10 years associated with the stockholm institute for peace research you know where stockholm is that is where that soviet nuclear submarine surfaced by accident much to the consternation of the swedish people well you can accept those people you can believe physicians for nuclear responsibility and women strike for peace and they are great organizations or you can accept the judgment of eugene rostow who served in a democratic administration gen edward rowny who spent a professional lifetime in this field the entire defense department the state department the cia general williams director of the defense intelligence agency and the other experts i tell you what for the sake of argument forget them let us listen to the secretary of defense under president jimmy carter harold brown who was supposed to be a dove well he testified on april 30 before the senate foreign relations committee and he said i have to add that i do not think that putting those proposals into effect would be very helpful to unitedstates security people i think are gravely concerned about the effects of a nuclear war rightly so we would be destroyed if there were a thermonuclear war by the weapons that now exist therefore freezing that situation says well we will freeze the situation such that if there is a nuclear war we will be destroyed so a freeze by itself is not enough and i am afraid it has become something of a substitute for detailed consideration of what it is you want to do to reduce the chance of nuclear war and reduce the size of nuclear stockpiles i think therefore that what is needed is not a statement of a freeze because they all have bad flaws in my judgment but proceeding to detailed negotiations i would have grave problems for example with a situation that froze unitedstates bomber and cruise missiles development but had no effect on soviet air defense systems because they are not nuclear i would have comparable problems with a freeze that prevented the united states from improving the survivability of its nuclear submarines ballistic missile submarines but allowed soviet antisubmarine warfare to go ahead because it is not nuclear when you add to that the verification problems you can see that endorsement of a freeze can be a substitute for constructive action that is harold brown tie former secretary of defense under mr carter you know it was ironic in 1962 when khrushchev blinked over cuba at president john kennedy that is because we had nuclear superiority and they had inferiority from salt i to salt ii the roles have become strategically reversed they possess superiority and we have the inferiority and by freezing we reward their rearming and we penalize our restraint what would a freeze now do i tell you what it ivould do and some of you may love this it would kill the neutron bomb which is our counter to the overwhelming soviet tank advantage it would kill the b1 that leaves us with the old b52s some of which are much older than the pilots flying them it would kill any more production of sealaunched

historically a womans role has been defined by her position in the family while it cannot be denied that the influence of wives and mothers was and is of central importance to oui society as a whole neither can it be denied that therein the influence remains even today in the decade of the eighties women are in great measure looked upon as subordinate our voices have been silenced and our ideas fettered i firnmly believe that a chief villain in the perhaps unconscious mindset which perpetuates the myth that women are invisible and inconsec iential is the american textbook only in the midl9th century with the emergence of suffragism were women offered a route to social equality yet as we are all well aware enfranchisement was only realized in 1920 with the 19th amendment i would venture a guess that the better than half a century battle for the ballot is covered in less than 5 pages of our history books yet this institutional reform alone reshaped attitudes and generated greater basic societal changes than perhaps any other movement in our short history this is but one example among many of the belligerent neglect of women in our history today in this chamber however we have an even more poignant example if the entire house of representatives and the senate were assembled here this morning we would note 514 men and 21 womenhardly a ratio representative of the population of this country if we were to travel to our state legislatures we would find the same disproportionate representation if each of us recall our years in the university and jobs to follow my educated guess would be that there were few women role models in any of those situations we have a responsibility not only as legislators but as mothers and fathers authors and artists democrats and republicans educators and workers to insure that the youth of our nation who are the directors of our tomorrows have the most rounded presentation of their ancestral heritage as is possible women in history
