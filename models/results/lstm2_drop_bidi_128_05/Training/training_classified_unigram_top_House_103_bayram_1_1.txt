we are not talking about some unreasonable plan for employees to skip out on their jobs for vacation we are talking about a simple guarantee a simple guarantee that you will not have to live in fear oflosing your job when you are forced to take a brief leave for a legitimate family or medical reason a simple guarantee that you will not lose your health insurance benefits just when your family needs them most a simple guarantee that makes sense for american workers and american business with a family and medical leave benefit business gains as much as the worker workers who can count on their jobs being there when they return from a family emergency will then in turn strengthen their commitment to their employers studies have even shown that employers with generous leave policies

and in support of the sabo amendment and the frankshays amendment h r 3400 is part of an ongoing effort to bring our deficit down to zero while ensuring that the engines of our economy do not sputter and faile careful balancing act indeed in august we enacted a nearly 500 billion deficit reduction package with 255 billion coming from spending cuts as a part of that package discretionary spending levels were frozen at the fiscal year 1993 level for each of the next 5 years we are now considering a number of proposals to further enhance spending reductions including rescissions for this fiscal year next year i am hopeful we will complete action on comprehensive health care reform the enactment of which most agree will be key to the long run dissipation of our deficit and the national debt h r 3400 includes many of the efforts of the reinventing government proposals recommended by vice president gore this proposal as modified by the sabo amendment will cut federal spending by 37 1 billion over 5 years it is important to note that h r 3400 and the appropriations rescissions legislation were considered however quickly by the relevant committees in the house most of the reductions some 32 5 billionn the bill today come from the reductions in the federal work force cutting 252 000 fulltime equivalent positions by fiscal year 1998 other provisions include actions taken by banking committee to facilitate section 235 mortgage refinancing and the much needed reform of fha multifamily property disposition the bill terminates the advanced metal uquld reactor program modlfies the essential air services subsidies improves financial management tools of the federal government and provides incentives reorganizations and phaseouts to produce savings across other federal departments an additional 1 9 billion was cut by the appropriatlions committee in fiscal year 1994 outlays the frankshays amendment will include these provisions along with specific reductions in funding for ballistic missile defense programs eliminating the space station and requiring european allies to pay a greater share of the cost of stationing unitedstates forces in europe it is estimated to cut spending by 51 5 billion over 5 years when combined with the sabo amendment and the provisions of the basic measure i have long supported the proposed cuts in the frankshays amendment and will do so again toddy i am opposed however to the refined and evolved pennykasich amendment the motivesbehind this amendment are no doubt appropriate nonetheless good intentions dont necessarily make good budget policy many of the proposals brought to us at this time are not fully understood or adequately explained by the proponents furthermore this amendment has been offered as a litmus test of who is for cutting spending and who isnt yet the specifics of how these cuts would be achieved are not outlined and have become more and more clouded as the measures details have become outlined those which are still defined are contradictory to many major goals and initiatives now being advanced in this congress in the haste to cut the deficit with this proposal it is clear that there are more negatives than positives notwithstanding protestantions to the contrary this amendment could jeopardize the passage of health care reform by acting now on 34 billion of largely undefined medicare entitlement savings which have been assumed by all health care reform proposals to help pay for their programs the pennykasich measure seriously undermines the adoption of health care reform threatening one of the real opportunities that the congress will have to get the exploding federal health care deficit under control i am deeply concerned about the provision in the pennykasich amendment that would require upper income medicare part b users to pay 100 percent of the national average 96 percent of counties in the united states have costs less than the national average while charging a premium reflective of actual cost has merit charging any users more than cost is not equitable furthermore on the health care funding cuts the amendment slices 5 billion from state reimbursement for health care without a clue as to how states struggling to pay for health care today would absorb a billion dollar a year cut for each of the 5 years many of the other provisions of the evolved pennykasich proposal are not merely deficit cutting measures that are basic changes in public policy that have not been reflected on studied or considered by the relevant committee of this congress there may well be some ideas of merit in this plethora of policy changes eliminating programs creating new federal departments radically changing policv paths with one vote without thoughtful dilberations by the committees without informing the american people or examining the total impact is unwise and unfair to those adversely affected acting on over 80 separate proposals in a single floor amendment is always troublesome but in the manner of the penny kasich amendment it is irresponsble even under the rhetoric of budget cutting you cannot legitimize such arbitrary action finally congress has already imposed strict caps in discretionery spending in the 1993 obrafreezing levels at or below fiscal year 1993 for 5 years without adjusting for inflation in fact in order to comply with these existing spending caps congress will need to come up with 78 billion in new notyetidentified cuts just to stay within existing caps as required by the act under the 1993 obra congress set discretionary caps 56 billion below the presidents budget in addition the president included 22 billion in unspecified cuts which leads to the 78 billion in total cuts this cutting process is guaranteed to cause pain on a broad spectrum of national programs because the pennykasich plan lowers the spending caps by most of the amount that it purports to save were the amendment to be enacted about 70 billion in additional cuts not included in the plan itself will still have to be found and implemented upon analysis pennykasich proposes to make the identical cuts in numerous instances already assumed in the previously enacted budget and spending cut law in essence this means that pennykasich is counting tens of billions of dollars twice and that we have no demonstrated reduction that would illustrate the impact pennykasich is a leap in blind faith cloaked in the political rhetoric of cutting spending the short term glory and bragging rights on this vote may be great but the effect and precision of its impact and making it work in the final analysis will lead to wholesale cuts that have not been thought out and for which the credit or blame will likely be denied by the proponents congress must continue to be at the forefront of deficit reduction efforts along with the clinton administration we must move responsibly and realistically to reduce our spending without endangering our precarious economic recovery or our efforts to address the human deficit one way to make congress irrelevant is to pass measures that are improbable if not impossible to achieve this simply feeds public cynicism in the long run for short term political gain we have had repeated performances and experience of following this sirens song throughout the 1980s i urge my colleagues to support the sabo amendment and the

because primarily there is a systematic policy in mexico to keep wages low the minimum wage is just 58 cents an hour even in the highest paying jobs mexican workers earn less in a day than american workers earn in an hour because productivity is rising rapidly in mexico and why should it not be the multinationals are pouring their investment dollars into mexico chasing after these very low wages

interior auto parts these sections of the plant have been idled for numerous shifts in recent years while ford is turning out a similar product component in mexico you go up the road a little west in

statesmexican studies at the university of california in san diego he did a study that backs up with facts what most americans and most american workers have known all along that the ratification of nafta poses a very real and a very immediate threat to american jobs good jobs american manufacturing jobs the kind of jobs that you raise families with that you buy homes with that you put a little aside so you can send your kids to college now this research documents three main points no 1 mexicos newest manufacturing facilities the newest ones they are building down there are every bit as sophisticated as plants here at home the second point mexicos wages are only a fraction of the wages here in the united states a very small fraction no 3 wages make a big difference even in hightechnology manufacturing add these three points together and you get one conclusion nafta will gobble up american jobs faster than the dinosaurs in jurassic park will gobble up people now mexicos newest manufacturing facilities are very sophisticated newer mexican manufacturing facilities are every bit as sophisticated as the plants as i have said right here at home in fact because of the way the current investment dollars are pouring into mexico the true state of the art technology is more likely to be found in mexico than here in the united states you take the ford motor co for in stance they have a 500 million assembly and stamping plant at hermosillo mexico or matrix aeronautica a 250 million aircraft and maintenance repair facility in tijuana or the general motors plant in mexico

they make sense and because i believe that they are strong projects i believe that they would pass a fair and open test of review and scrutiny by the appropriate committee of jurisdiction in short i believe that these projects could stand on their own two feet and walk through the front door in full public view instead of being slipped through the back door of a pork barrel process that violates common sense and fairness and so i voted against last nights bill even though there was money in it for my district and my state my vote mr speaker and members of the house will not be bought by the promise of some pork barrel spending in my district so that hundreds of millions of dollars of pork barrel spending can be wasted around this country i will not keep quiet i wont go along to get along

there are 150 centers prepared to open that have demonstrated need and that have met all of our criteria in addition there are 75 additional axpplicants who have been able to demonstrate that they

clinics tend to be located in the very areas where the majority of americans without health insurance live they are in the areas where there is a shortage they are in the areas where often the poorest live they are in the city neighborhoods they are in the most isolated rural areas they are where the people who have the least access to health care live and furthermore even if we mandate that all employers provide health insurance even if we mandate that everyone in america has health insurance there will still be problems in accessing the system until we expand our community health center system i there is a lack of transportation in cities and in rural areas there is a lack of providers in many areas of the nation it is only by expanding this infrastructure of care that we can make access to community health care a reality for the majority of those 37 million who are uninsured in my state of connecticut these community health centers helped those that went through serious

honestly based on realistic economic assumptions it represents an end to the hidethemedicine approach of past administrations starting with government itself it provides for deficit reductions of 493 billion over 4 years and 703 billion over 5 years under the presidents plan the deficit as a percentage of our national income will be cut in half over a 4year period if you are a social security recipient who does not pay taxes on current benefits you will not pay taxes under the presidents plan that means that 84 percent of all seniors will see no change in the tax treatment of benefits on the matter of taxes no working american will experience an increase in income taxes under the presidents plan unless they are in the top 2 percent of all americans by income only couples with incomes of over 180 000 and individuals over 140 000 will see any change in their income taxes under the presidents plan in the 1980s the richest 1 percent of americans experienced more income growth than 90 percent of americans combined that is why the presidents package asks that persons with incomes of over 100 000 pay 70 percent of the total revenue increases derived from all sources for workingage families outside of the top 2 percent the only significant increase in direct taxes will come from the new broadbased energy tax a family making 35 000 or 40 000 a year will pay less than 200 per year in increased direct energy costs and some of that increase can be avoided by using energy more efficiently now i know that some on the minority side of the aisle are saying for instance that the dip in the stock market 2 days ago was a message that the policyis wrong well i would say just the opposite is true as kevin phillips noted recently the richest 1 percent of americans own half of the privately held stock in america what happened 2 days ago is that they simply had a temper tantrum because they finally realized they will be asked to pay their fair share the right comparison for any taxpayer no matter what their income group is not between the presidents plan and nothing it is between the cost of the presidents plan compared to the cost of continuing the status quo if we continue to follow the policies of the past decade middleincome families will be treated as they have been treated for the past decade under the status quo they can expect continued stagflation in real income which has essentially been flat between 1977 and 1992 for families in the middle income of this country they can expect continued struggles to afford to send their kids to college they can expect continued problems finding and holding on to decent paying jobs people say oh this economy is now recovering but the fact is if you compare this recovery with the aierage of the recovery under the seven previous recessions you will see that we are falling 3 million jobs short of meeting the average from all past recession recoveries we can do better and the president outlined last night how we can do better for families in the middle they can be asked to do nothing and then they will get nothing just as they have for the last decade except for a continued squeeze downward on their real incomes or they can be asked to make a modest contribution tiny in comparison to that asked of the wealthy i am confident that so long as we are all in it together the vast majority of americans will gladly make a contribution to a program that they believe is finally real and is finally fair now i recognize that there are going to be those in this town who will use any number and any opportunity to attack the policy of a president who has been in office less than 3 weeks i recognize the way this town works but i would hope for once in this chamber and out that we can rise above that and

not safe it is not safe to walk the streets in many places in america they could be made safer with more police something the president has promised and something that we have had difficulty reducing

cars on the road fully armed and equipped for the same amount of money or urban police would probably be close to that number now of course the russians can take that number and they can quickly go back and check on my county budget and they can interpolate how much money we might be cutting out of the budget here and soon hey will know that we are cutting somewhere near 3 billion and america will be less safe because the russians know that we cut 3 billion out of this budget how much are we spending well i cannot tell you that it is classified what are we doing with the money are we

the good of those agencies and for the good of america and to cut the deficit they had lost their jobs just like my loggers are losing their jobs just like people who work in military bases are losing

offices of the house the offices affected are the clerks the doorkeeper the director of nonlegislative services the office of law revision counsel and legislative counsel the figure of 2 942 000 was chosen because in testimony before the legislative appropriations subcommittee the requesting offices did not provide clear justification for purchases they requested in its report the subcommittee stated equipment purchases and upgrades to existing systems are sometimes necessary however it is essential that appropriate review be made of the justification and potential costs and savings

to respond to those demands i strongly endorse the subcommittees position that these new purchases should not be made until the requesting offices provide proper costbenefit information on these

authorization of equipment items is given prior to including these items in budget request the equipment requested by these offices may indeed prove necessary in helping the house carry out its duties and once sufficient need is demonstrated then the purchases can be made that money would have to come from reprogrammed savings identified by the director of nonlegislative services once the director finds the money then these equipment purchases can be made we are facing a significant budget deficit in the houses budget this fiscal year it certainly seems to me that we should be more prudent in allocating every dollar that goes into the operation of the house for the year ahead without clear reasons for the necessity for this equipment we simply cannot afford any questionable outlays at this

great deal of publicity recently about the a to z proposal the goal of atoz is to open up the budget process to allow unlimited opportunities to offer spending cut amendments with respect to discretionary spending i would like to commend the house leadership for recently allowing an open rule on spending cut amendments for the last 11 appropriations bills this far exceeded the thrust of the atoz petition which was limited to cutting fiscal 1994 spending i believe that not only should each member of congress haveand opportunity to propose spending cuts but the president should also have such an opportunity to propose reductions in spending the expedited rescissions act which we are voting on today would be a significant step forward in this regard quite simply it would force the house and senate to vote on presidential requests to rescind specific items of spending i also commend my colleagues representatives stenholm penny and kasich for offering their amendment this is a bipartisan effort to improve and perfect the bill before us let me explain these improvements first this amendment would make the expedited rescissioh procedure permanent expedited rescission is a much needed change and should not be limited to the current congress as h r 4600 does second the stenholmpennykasich amendment allows presidential rescission messages to be sent at any time during the year rather than only allowing them immediately after the signing of appropriations bills this ensures that the administration will be able to make a mere careful evaluation of spending that has been approved by congress prior to any proposals to rescind third the amendment makes a number of more technical changes for example the amendment allows 50 house members or 15 senators to request a vote to strike an individual rescission from the presidents proposed rescission package finally the amendment extends the special rescission procedures to allow presidential proposals to repeal targeted tax benefits in revenue bills this is a very important change allowing consideration of special interest provisions inserted in large revenue bills i would even suggest that we also include contracting authority within the enhanced rescission authority to be given the president under this bill if the president had authority to request rescission of appropriations tax expenditures and

addition the unitedstates catholic conference writes we ask for your support in defeating any amendment that would overturn or interfere with the department of health and human services authority to make the decision about what diseases are on the exclusion list in addition the national commission on aids appointed by president bush writes the commission voices its deep distress over the encroachment once again of extraneous issues into a decision that should be sciencebased and focused solely on public health concerns we must not allow arguments based on politics misinformation fear or discrimination to triumph in addition to that the association of state and territorial health officials writes because hiv infection is not spread by casual contact and immigration of infected individuals does not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the population astho continues to support removal of hiv infection from the list of communicable diseases of public health significance upon which unitedstates travel and immigration can be denied the fact is they strongly believe that that decision should be made by the public health service apha the american public

providers who also support the position that the department of health and human services should be the arena where this decision is made in closing i would like to quote they say that we the undersigned represent medical research scientists deeply concerned about the interim ruling these people restate the idea that i have been emphasizing in my remarks that this decision should be left to the public health service it reads we are all dedicated to stemming the hiv aids epidemic and it is out of this dedication that we write to you we ask that you join us in taking a stance on this issue based on medical and epidemiologic truth and not on distracting and potentially harmful misconceptions we thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this important international and public health matter in conclusion i would like to say that i am sure that we all share the view that we want to stop the spread of aids in our country and in the world we all share the view that if anyone who comes into this country poses a danger or a threat to the health of americans we cannot have that happen we all share the view that we cannot have people coming in who will become a public health charge and that is a cost to the unitedstates taxpayers but the point where we differ is who makes the decision about that how contagious or what the merit is of a disease to be put on the list but in this motionto instruct we will be talking about congress making scientific and medical decisions i oppose the motion to instruct because i believe that authority should rest with the public health service"], [0.0036946237087249756, 0.496305376291275, 1, "i rise in strong support of this rule and strong support of this bill i think it is time it is justice long overdue it is not complete justice it will not take care of all the inequities but it is a start it is a start forinstance for those claimants who have been in this process year after year after year who retire because of pneumoconiosis or black lung as it is popularly known andthen begin to go through all the administrative hoops and procedural barriers of the black lung programs it is the case for instance of people who have cases pending anywhere from 7 to 10 years it is the case for instance of somebody who knows that they will never receive their benefits their one hope is that they will last long enough and so finally there will be victory and their spouse usually their widow will receive those benefits this would for instance end the practice of running claimants around to different medical examiners until there is a decision adverse to them so that it ends the practice of making them go to doctor after doctor after doctor trying to get that decision that will eventually rule against them it would assume for instance that death that would come from pneumoconiosis if the claimant was receiving benefits or was disabled by pneumoconiosis at the time of death that makes sense does it not unfortunately not in the administration of the black lung program some of my colleagues and i understand some of them are not from coalmining country they wonder why what is the problem here why can medicare as has been suggested not cover it or cobra nobody can afford cobra that i have been able to see but why cobra cannot cover it let me try and create the picture for my colleagues of a mine first of all turn the lights out in here then after that pretend like there are cutting machines going in every corner and just to make it complete start the fans going that blow black coal dust at you and blows at you and you breathe it day after day after day 30 or 40 years we will not even get into the occupational safety aspects of it the fact that the roof is creaking overhead we have to worry about roof falls we have to worry about it being the most hazardous industry in the country we will talk about the hazards that come after people retire and they are going to retire and if they have worked in there 20 years at least they are going to retire with black long there is no way around it they are going to be disabled and it is going to be steadily degenerative as a result my colleagues they cannot eat and inhale black coal dust day after day after day without having severe respiratory problems resembling emphysema that are going to get worse and worse every day they walk out of that mine and indeed often for people long after they have left the mine every time they cough they are going to cough black dust that is what black lung is most of us are fortunate we do not have to worry about that men and women who work underground every day do so that is what this program is about after they have worked all that time they ought not be frustrated by a prograin that is really procedurally almost designed to frustrate them this is a chance to bring some justice it is a chance to remove some of the administrative barriers it is a chance finally to bring a little bit of light to an occupation that does not see a whole lot of it i urge adoption of this rule and the bill"], [0.0044678449630737305, 0.5044678449630737, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding to me and i appreciate his position i rise in very strong support of this legislation congratulate the chairman and the ranking members for their work on this i rise in support of h r 3841 the interstate banking efficiency act the bill before us today is the product of considerable work by the banking community and congress for too many years the issue of interstate branching when unresolved as a number of smaller issues sidetracked it however today under the suspension of the rules we are able to vote on what has always been the central issue for interstate banking whether interstate branching would be permitted and whether by extension our country would move forward to reduce the often duplicative regulatory requirements placed on interstate banks if we pass this bill we will permit interstate branching and allow some of our countrys largest banks to consolidate their operations and improve their efficiency why is this important every dollar the bank ties up in regulatory capital requirements or pays in administrative costs is a dollar that cannot be loaned to a small business which wants to expand its operations or to a family which is paying for a childs college education the interstate banking legislation will make interstate banks more competitive and will allow them to make more money available to communities and families i recognize the concerns which many smaller independent banks raised over this legislation for that reason i am also pleased the bill before us today includes important provisions allowing states to opt out of interstate banking and branching the bill also restricts larger interstate banks to a percentage of the deposits they can control nationwide and within a particular state i urge my colleagues to support this legislation vote for h r 3841 and free banks to invest more of their money in the businesses and individuals who drive economic growth"], [0.007462561130523682, 0.4925374388694763, 1, "and i would conclude by just putting a cap on the discussion about the unitedstates constitution society at that time had in it the virtues the values the structure that allowed for the debate to go forward the name of the resolution to the problems that confronted our founding forefathers was none other than the connectidut compromise and how well we would be to incorporate the language or the vocabulary the word compromise back into our debate that would allow us to go forward with discussions that would ultimately allow us to find resolution incorporating a little bit of everybodys ideas we have a president i believe who understands this value there are individuals in this congress i believe who want to incorporatethese philosophies we also are coming off of a time and we still see the results in some members philosophies that want to divide and conquer and destroy in order to build up out of the ashes we cannot fall prey to that mentality we have to hopefully see the greater glory and the greater value in incorporating the vision of our founding forefathers in coming up with the kinds of solutions that i think ultimately can be far more exciting far more productive and far more impacting on the attitudes of all americans because they are out there waiting for this to happen and their trust in government their belief in our abilities is not going to come forward based on partisan votes where only democrats pass legislation or only republicans are able to thwart legislation they are only going to trust this government when we come to a place where they see there is openness there is a willingness to entertain all viewpoints there is real debate about real issues establishing real commonality in discussing differences and ultimately enacting not rhetoric but real solutions that are going to make differences in peoples lives if we can do that then i think more important than what we do how we do it will make all the difference and that is the road i think we shouldtake i thank the gentleman very much for sharing in my time"]]}
