12 6 percent and the growth in costs we have seen as a result of the skyrocketing health costs this president has allowed not medicaid itself if these cuts in medicaid are made the ranks of the uninsured are surely going to increase even more weakening our economy and health care would be more expensive because of fewer regular checkups and preventative measures and a rise of emergency room

restore iraqs oil infrastructure i would like to know why unredacted versions of this audit report and the audit reports on nine additional task orders are still being withheld from congress i have also learned that administration officials violated a u n security council resolution by intentionally concealing these overcharges from international auditors the administration only provided heavily redacted audits to the international auditors charged with overseeing the iraqi oil revenue used to pay halliburtons inflated costs worst of all correspondence between the army corps of engineers and

profiteering it is disturbing that the republican leadership has been unwilling to assert its oversight responsibility and demand fiscal accountability the administration has not complied with congressional mandates to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the 200 billion already spent in iraq and afghanistan and a detailed assessment of the projected costs of military and reconstruction

armor night vision equipment and jamming devices to neutralize the improvised explosive devices that are among the biggest threats to unitedstates patrols i am willing to support this supplemental

affected area the grants also may be used for training activities which is especially critical for our residents who may need employment in new industries while this existing assistance is crucial for

to be debated ought to have opportunity for amendment and then something that is near and dear to my heart as a physician in my former life along with dr gingrey and my other colleagues is the issue of prescription drugs and the medicare part d prescription drug program an extremely complex issue extremely complex issue and today what the majority party did was say that we will bring within the next week to the floor of this house a bill that has never been discussed in committee it has never had a hearing it has never had anybody in this body be able to offer an amendment officially and have folks vote on it and say yes or no they believe that that is the case that has never been through that process that results in the best work product that is available for a bill and for ultimately a law and from the rumors that we hear and we only hear rumors because we dont have the legislative language because we do not know what is going to be in that bill but from the rumors that we hear the result of that bill will be a decrease in the kinds of medications that are available to the american people that may go into effect if the majority party goes forward with the rule that they adopted today that may go into effect without anybody in this house of representatives ever having an opportunity to affect that outcome j 2145 some on the majority side would say well it has been talked about for a long time it was voted on the medicare prescription drug program was voted on in 2003 got a lot of hearings then there were a lot of people that talked about it and voiced their opinion on it at that time that is true but what hasnt happened is that every single freshman member of this house was duly elected in their districts and has a right a right under our system of government to have input into a bill that comes out of the house of representatives every single freshman will have no input into that bill or into the bill as it relates to minimum wage as it relates to stem cell research or anything else that was included in the rules package today never that has never been done as my colleagues said before never been done in the history in the history of this nation to have that kind of substantive legislation dealt with in a way that does not allow that kind of input that kind of rule that kind of process which is difficult to get your arms around but that kind of process i would suggest to you is an abuse of majority power our job on the miriority side is to hold people accountable for their actions and for their decisions it is important that the american people understand and appreciate that thesedecisions that were made on the very first day which by and large are procedural issues that are difficult to get folks interested in but they not only set the tone for this congress but they set the rules under which we make major decisions that will affect the american people as it relates to their income as it relates to their security and as it relates to their health nothing nothing could be more impor tant this is indeed a historic day but it is also a day of concern it is a day of concern because what goes on here is extremely important within these walls we can effect change that will benefit citizens all across our nation we can also effect change that will harm citizens all across our nation if we work together we will do much more of the former and very little of the latter let me close by jilst saying as i have said before the challenges that we face in this nation are huge they are immense but they are not republican challenges and they are not democrat challenges they are american challenges if we work together as a body of elected representatives from all across this wonderful and glorious nation we will come up with the best product the best legislation the best laws that will result in the most amount of benefit to our citizens all across this nation so i challenge i challenge my democrat colleagues to fulfill the promises that they made on the election during the election campaign to fulfill the promises that they made to fulfill the promises that they made when they talked to citizens in their districts all across this nation about openness and about civility and about fiscal responsibility that challenge that challenge making certain that you fulfill those promises is what will ring true to the american people i appreciate once again the opportunity to come to the floor tonight"], [0.8820682391524315, 0.11793176084756851, 1, "the bill before us would create a new agency within the department of health and human services the biomedical advanced research and development authority or barda i support creating this new agency however some provisions in the bill raise concerns because they waive a number of existing federal statutes enacted to ensure proper government oversight i want to express my reservations over these provisions and urge that they be addressed in conference this bill contains exemptions from important federal open government laws designed to ensure accountability and transparency like the freedom of information act foia and federal procurement law these open government laws are within the jurisdiction of the committee on govemment reform on which i am the ranking member but unfortunately the government reform committee did not have an opportunity to consider the bill foia is the central law that guarantees public access to government information it establishes the presumption that people should be able to access information held by the government foia contains exemptions that prevent the disclosure of information in the case where harm could result from disclosureincluding exemptions for classified information trade secrets information compiled for law enforcement purposes and internal agency documents that would be exempt from discovery jn litigation h r 5533 establishes a new foia exemption requiring the secretary to withhold from public disclosure specific technical data of scientific information that is created or obtained durirrg countermeasure research and product advanced development funded by the secretary that reveal vulnerabilities of existing dical or public health defenses against biological chemical nuclear or radiological threats while this exemption appears narrow in scope the administration has a long record of interpreting narrow language broadly to withhold public information unless there is a compelling reason why the existing foia exemptions are inadequatewhich there does not appear to be in this case it is unwise to add new exemptions to foia moreover the language of the new exemption is not clear the language applies to any advanced research and development that is funded by the secretary which may inappropriately extend the exemption far beyond barda to other research funded by the department of health and human services another issue is socalled other transaction authority this authority is essentially a waiver from most federal procurement law everything from competition requirements to auditing and pricing safeguards to the buy america and drugfree workplace laws the authority was originally developed to help dod in at tracting smaller contractors to federal research and development contracts though in practice it has not often been used to accomplish that objective while i am not necessarily opposed to granting barda other transaction authority i have yet to hear a convincing rationale for its necessity if such a rationale exists we should explore ways to limit its application at barda to those instances where it is truly needed as opposed to the blanket grant of authority currently in h r 5533 finally h r 5533 exempts all advisory committees established under the bill from section 14 of the federal advisory committee act section 14 was added to the faca law because congress decided that there was a proliferation of advisory committees and that it is important to ensure that they should continuously be reviewed to ensure their ongoing necessity again there is no clear explanation for why this waiver of current law is necessary or what interests would be protected by exempting the committees from renewal requirements all of these issues are within the jurisdiction of the government reform

appreciate the contributions that he made so we have not been exclusionary at all and a lot of other committees simply do not allow nonmembers of the committee to participate mr chabot did but i would like to point out that much of the impetus behind this amendment comes from georgia and i think the fallacy of the amendment of the gentleman from georgia is that he wants to base coverage exclusively

including the past history of discrimination and discriminatory voting practices in georgia there have been 91 objections since the last reauthorization by the department of justice and seven of them have been objections that have resulted in withdrawal of voting changes since 2002 so the arguments that georgia isnt doing all this bad stuff anymore are not borne out by the statistics of what has been submitted to the justice department and where preclearance has been rejected during the general debate today i introduced two rather extensive reports into the record from outside groups that gave the history of section 5 objections and voting rights problems in the state of georgia since the 1982 reauthorization now the amendment that mr norwood has proposed is a trojan horse it is

that done and it took republican leadership and it took a republican congress to get it done we will end some of the harassment that is going on in terms of local lawsuits and protect consumers the

and dear to the gentlewomans and that is tax reform the tax reform that we have acted upon this year in this congress is the death tax permanent repeal of the death tax this is part of that those posters and the items that the gentlewoman talked about 100 days 100 ways what house republicans have done to strengthen america the death tax the other side of the aisle earlier this evening said that tax cuts hurt americans i was dumbfounded when i heard that tax cuts hurt americans do my colleagues know that the death tax itself costs h4876 the american economy up to 250 000 jobs annually by permanently repealing the death tax we would add more than 100 000 jobs each year nearly 60 percent of business owners say that they would add jobs over the coming year if death taxes were permanently and completely eliminated what does the death tax do well it is the leading cause of the dissolution of thousands of familyrun small businesses small businesses owned by families the death tax comes at the end when somebody dies who is the senior in the family and what happens is that that death tax is instituted and they have to sell that family business in order to pay that death tax it penalizes work it penalizes savings it deals an incredible death blow to small businesses get this statistic more than 70 percent of family businesses do not survive the second generation eightyseven percent do not make it to the third generation why is that how much does that death tax take you talk about 15 percent taxes here is high and 20 percent there and the income tax has a rate that is higher than that but what does the death tax take fortyseven percent fortyseven percent it is no wonder that 70 percent of small businesses do not survive to the next generation so the death tax is unfair it is unjust it hampers economic growth it increases the cost of capital it artificially elevates interest rates and this is another astounding fact it probably costs the government and taxpayers more to collect the tax than the tax revenue that is gotten that is the kind of nonsense that americans are tired of so what did our congress do led by republicans and joined by some

have obviously taught all of us that we no longer have the luxury of ignoring state failure at the turn of the millennium the government of afghanistan all too quickly collapsed was replaced by the ruthless taliban and became a safe haven for al qaeda the attacks that our country suffered were a tragic wakeup call to the dangers that failed states pose to our national security nearly 4 years later too many countries remain beset by corruption violence resource scarcity and literally no leadership scores of these governments could collapse at a moments notice and be replaced by anarchy these failing states represent a grave danger to the united states our government must be prepared to stabilize where we can and reconstruct what we must in order to prevent a devastating vacuum of lawlessness from developing which allows terrorists and rogue leaders to flourish the president and congress have already taken a strong first step in addressing this challenge the establishment of the office for the coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization created a central interagency coordination point for international stabilization and reconstruction operations the office headed by ambassador carlos pascual will monitor political and economic stability worldwide and prepare plans for stabilization missions for the most dire of cases but more must be done madam chairman one of the presidents top priorities for this new office is to create a civilian rapid response unit to deploy on short notice to sites of international instability the goal is to mitigate any potential conflict and if possible prevent it the amendment that i am offering would today authorize the creation of an active response corps comprised of unitedstates government personnel who have the skills necessary for such missions the amendment also will expand the use of civilian volunteers from outside the government who have the right talents and are willing to serve in stabilization reconstruction missions overseas there are many americans who have the skills and desire to serve the country by preventing conflict and expanding democracy as we heard today from prime minister singh

proposes comprehensive reform of the federal housing administration known as fha single family mortgage insurance activities giving fha the ability to otfer an array of products will allow it to more fairly price its guarantee to the individual borrowers and will allow it to base each borrowers mortgage insurance premium on therisk that the borrower poses to the fha mortgage insurance fund under this proposal the mortgage insurance premiums will consider the borrowers credit history loantovalue ratio debttoincome ratio and will be based on fhas historical experience with similar borrowers this change will decrease premiums for many of the fhas traditional borrowers thereby increasing their access to homeownership it will also allow fha to reach potential homebuyers who for various reasons do not currently qualify for an fha loan product h r 5121 would allow fha to become more efficient and streamlined modernizing fha will improve competition in the prime home loan mortgage industry and effectively assist the industry in combating abusive and or discriminatory lending practices this bill would not create a new government program rather it would significantly modernize the national housing act while reforming and empowering the agency thereby addressing some of the agencys limitations more importantly i believe that if enacted this bill will help further increase the countrys homeownership rate especially among low and moderateincome and minority families since its inception in 1934 fha has played an innovative role in financing homeownership and affordable housing opportunities for all americans over the past 8 years alone fha has financed nearly 8 million homes and over 754 000 units of affordable rental housing the mortgage market has changed dramatically in recent years creating what is today the worlds most sophisticated real estate finance system this system has led to the highest rate of homeownership in unitedstates history and to the efficient production of thousands of units of affordable rental housing each year however in more recent times fha has been a mortgage insurer of the last resort potential homeowners who can participate in the private mortgage insurance market do so i believe this is because fha has become costly and the paperwork unmanageable thus only the riskiest borrowers now use fha for mortgage insurance moreover while the prime market remained relatively constant the nonprime market between 2003 and 2005 grew from 118 billion to 650 billion in mortgages while fha went from insuring 9 2 percent to 4 1 percent of the nations mortgages it is important to distinguish the difference between subprime lending which is necessary and critical for nontraditional borrowers and predatory abusive lending which is designed to take advantage of vulnerable americans pursuing their american dream of homeownership while not predatory the subprime market is not working for many families these are the families fha is really designed to reach among other things h r 5121 would allow fha to provide alternative access as well as standardization of a market niche designed to follow the agencys example moreover the federal government will always have a need for an agency to provide the type of services symbolized by the fha while the agency only has a market share of approximately 3 to 4 percent elimination of fha will be disastrous if a capital mortgage financial crisis emerges such as we saw in the united states in the 1980s further it would be impossible to recreate this agency to respond rapidly to a housing homeownership crisis that could possibly we hope not but emerge in the future h r 5121 will allow fha to fulfill its original mission when similar circumstances exist in 1934 interestonly and balloon payments were prevalent thus fha was established to give the private sector avenues to provide longterm fixedrate financing today fha continues to serve its original purpose by giving low to moderateincome home buyers a safer more affordable financing option for their homeownership we have a chance with this legislation to bring fha back into business and to restore the fha product to its traditional market position american families need safe options when purchasing a home at a fair price families need a way to take part in the american dream without putting themselves at risk families frankly need fha i just want to conclude my comments for this time by saying this is in my opinion one of the most critical pieces of legislation and if we havent

conferees on the bill 8 republicans and 6 democrats thirteen of those conferees signed the conference report we had all the republicans in the senate and five of the six democrats sign this conference report in the house a majority of the house democrat conferees have signed the report a majority of the energy and commerce committee conferees that were general conferees a majority of those conferees signed the conference report including the distinguished former chairman of the committee john dingell of michigan we have a bipartisan bill that has come before the house as i enunciated earlier if yodr vision of an energy policy is a policy where the government tells you what you can do and when you can do it and how you can use your energy this is not your bill but if your vision of america is a vision of america that says it is okay to let the private sector with the appropriate environmental guidelines and open market transparency rules and regulations develop its resources for the good of all the people this is your bill in terms of incentives for alternative energy this bill has got more incentives at the individual level and at the general industrial level than any other energy bill that has ever been before this congress whatever your energy source of choice is there is something in this bill to help you decide if you want to maximize that choice what this bill does not do is say every american has to drive a vehicle that gets 50 miles to the gallon whether they want to or not those vehicles are available right now in the marketplace and americans have the right to choose this bill does not dictate that choice this bill also makes it possible again without repealing or fundamentally changing any existing environmental law to do some at least exploration and in some cases development of our onshore and offshore energy resources as i said earlier it fundamentally revitalizes the clean coal technology industry in this country and the nuclear power industry in this country this is a good bill it is a bipartisan bill a majority of the house democrat conferees and every republican conferee signed the conference report last night when we were before the rules committee the gentleman from michigan and i were both unanimous in that this should come to the floor under a rule that both sides could support i want to commend the distinguished rules committee in the gentleman from washingtons view presenting the best rule that has ever been presented on the floor of the house of representatives"], [0.14818069338798523, 0.35181930661201477, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume first i thank chairman hunter and the ranking member mr skelton for their leadership on this very important piece of legislation i rise today to offer an amendment to title xiv to h r 5122 that would ent sure that the department of defense and the department of homeland secu rity work together as part of a homeland defensehomeland security technology transfer consortium to facilitate the transfer of viable dod technologies in order to enhance the home land security capabilities of federal state and local first responders the department of defense has been a leading developer of technology for years and some of the innovations it has pioneered may have outstanding homeland security afplications these types of technologies include unmanned aerial vehicles uavs ground sensors which help authorities monitor activities over vast expanses of terrain biometric identification technologies which can assist in the creation of tamperproof identity cards radiological detectors which can monitor the transport of nuclear and other potentially dangerous materials and sophisticated surveillance equipment examples of which include night vision goggles and microwave and infrared imaging gear while these technologies have been helpful to our warfighters overseas the federal state and local agencies charged with protecting us here at home could also make good use of these kinds of products unfortunately the process of transferring these tech nologies from the military to the civilian sector has been a bit slow as a member of the homeland security committee i would like first responders and other appropriate authorities to have quicker access to and to make good use of these technologies accordingly my amendment would provide for the creation of a homeland defensehomeland security technology transfer consortium that would facilitate this transfer it specifically calls for the inclusion of the department of homeland security which is already in the process of developing and utilizing many of these technologies that i have just described o within this consortium it also brings state and local first responders into the deliberative process the consortium will be involved in integrating new technologies into appropriate first responder exercises in promoting interoperability and of course in identifying and developing those defense technologies that have the most promising applications for homeland security by facilitating these kinds of transfers federal state and local agencies can work better together and can function more efficiently and the homeland can be safer i thank chairman hunter and the ranking member mr skelton for their leadership on this issue i reserve the balance of my time"],

threats that we have and one of the important resources that the gentleman from mississippi and i share is the mississippi river it is an incredibly important resources to this nation and to our national security and to our homeland security it is for just that reason that i offer this amendment to draw attention to the fact that sometimes as we make public policy we tend to lose sight of the things that may be more important than the numbet of people involved but most of all when we do things in washington d c it is so very important to be in touch with the people at home what this amendment does is call for the department of homeland security to coordinate with state local and tribal governments in establishing the criteria for prioritizing applications for the first responders grant this is something that i think is critical that we take the information and have a coordination between our local governments and the department of homeland security as they make the critical decisions about where these resources will be placed i appreciate again very much the chairman and the ranking member on the subcommittee being friendly towards this amendment and receiving it well certainly it is something that will prevent the states from devoting significant time resources and funding to establish a state homeland security plan in accordance with this bill only to find out after they apply for a grant that they have completely missed the mark on what the grant board established as its priority i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from mississippi"]]}
