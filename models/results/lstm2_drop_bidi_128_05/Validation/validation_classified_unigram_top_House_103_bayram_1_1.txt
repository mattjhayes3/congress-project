plan and his economic plan for growth and reducing the deficit and also for her very magnificent presentation and very clear presentation of the new direction that this deficit reduction plan will take our country i thank her very much for giving me this opportunity to participate in her special order tonight i am very pleased that the presidents plan as amended by the house and senate conferees turns out to be a very profamily plan it does this by its investments that it makes in people that helps at the very same time to reduce the deficit to give our people work not welfare and to give them hope not despair how does it do this well it is profamily in many respects one is its childrens initiatives that are contained in this package childhood immunization the family preservation and support act the mickey leland hunger relief act and the earned income tax credit in addition to the enterprise zones which will help create jobs in some of the areas of our country which need them the most i would just like to take a few minutes to elaborate on some of these points and then move on to some of the economic arguments that spring from these i believe that while these are profamily and they are investments in people they will help get this country moving as well as reduce the deficit as far as the immunization initiative is concerned president clinton said on our nation is the only industrialized nation in the entire world that does not guarantee childhood vaccination for all children it ought to be like clean water and clear air it ought to be part of the fabric of our life so spoke our president and he said that in the context of only 55 percent of our nations 2yearolds fully immunized against vaccinepreventable diseases in 1991 because of these low immunization rates a measles epidemic swept across the country with 55 000 victims 166 people were killed in the epidemic and 11 000 americans were hospitalized this could have been prevented next in the package i want to commend our president and conferees for putting funds in for family preservation 1 billion child abuse and neglect is an escalating national crisis of devastating proportions nearly 3 million children were reported physically sexually or emotionally abused or neglected last year 3 million children in our country and at least 3 children a day die from abuse most before their first birthday that is hard to imagine while tie number of children reported abused in fact more than doubled between 1981 and 1991 federal funding has been cut in half i am very pleased that the president and conferees included as i mentioned 51 billion in this package next the mickey leland childhood hunger relief act is a very important domestic antihunger initiative the most important introduced in the last 16 years i am very pleased that the president has and well we would like more money always but i think at this moment it is 2 5 billion for the mickey leland hunger relief act it would allow families in addition to the funds it also will allow families to deduct high shelter costs in the same way that elderly and disabled households do so at present this is very very important for our families who exceed 50 percent of their income for shelter it would also encourage payment and collection of child support and assist working families and children then in that package i conclude my focus there on the earned income tax credit this proposal substantially raises the level of credit for working families with children to lift working families out of poverty and provide the modest credit to very poor workers without children to help ensure that the doors of opportunity are open for all you would expect i say to my colleague the gentlewoman from connecticut that i would be supportive of a program that contained these initiatives being on the progressive side of the spectrum in this body and i am pleased that they are in the package again i think they not only help people they help reduce the deficit but i do want to turn now to some business voices which favor the package let me say first that the american people according to the wall street journal last week they reported that americans are expressing more support for president clintons economic plan as it nears its crucial final vote by a comfortable margin of 54 to 32 percent people say that the clinton plan would represent a step in the right direction and the survey indicates that many americans are sour on the conduct of mr clintons republican critics the american people support this plan i now want to address some of the business leaders last week 58 business leaders many of them republicans from across the country endorsed president clintons economic plan i would like to call to the attention of my colleagues and our listeners the comments of some of those business leaders chairman august busch of anheuserbusch said we applaud the fundamental fairness of your initial plan as well as the diligence with which you have worked to keep equity a cornerstone of the final product jerry pearlman chairman of zenith electronics said i strongly support your 500 billion deficit reduction plan and the selective spending cute and appropriate investments i have no doubt that your plan will meet the major challenge of reducing the deficit while stimulating economic growth job creation and investment further to this xerox ceo paul allaire said successful passage of the budget reconciliation bill is a critical step in restoring longterm economic growth and job creation the presidents economic program is a balanced approach that shifts national policy away from deficit spending and toward jobcreating investment the chairman of time warner gerald levin said this legislation is our only opportunity to move forward on the economic front to fail at this moment would have grave consequences for americans and american business around the globe i am proud to join you in encouraging swift and positive congressional action the ceo of tenneco mike walsh said the united states cannot continue to live on borrowed time and borrowed money we elected a new president because we wanted change now it is time to act not blink or quit the president is taking on one of the most critical issues we face as a country and it is time for us to stand up support him and start attacking the deficit and then finally the president of h r block harry buckley said the majority of h r blocks clients are middle and lowerincome taxpayers many of whom would benefit from the presidents plan to expand and simplify the eitc and distribute the tax burden more fairly throughout all income brackets the new york times said in its editorial last month antitax rhetoric poses a

political rhetoric we want this house to pass this budget very strongly you i say to my colleague presented very convincing arguments and compelling evidence of why this plan will work and why it must be done i think that it is clear that from left to right from people to business it is clearly viewed that we must reduce the deficit we must create jobs we must invest in people we must pass this

enlightening i believe in terms of demonstrating the very significant difference in the approaches as proposed by the gentleman to my right the gentleman from ohio and the democrat budget proposal the democrat budget proposal proposes to go forward with business as usual a budgetary process that was laid out in 1993 and continued through 1994 and now proposed for 1995 it has resulted in very sluggish growth in our economy it has resulted in higher taxes and it has resulted in estimated growth in the future by both the president and by cbo of 21 2 percent and by historic standards our goal has been growth of at least 3 percent to consider ourselves on the right path so the kasich budget in proposing to reduce the deficit by an additional 153 billion over what the democrat plan does recognizes in that respect that our spending pattern has gone up very rapidly yes through the 1980s and continues to increase rapidly now into the 1990s it also recognizes as the governor of new jersey recently has as a matter of fact that the tax code is a very very important tool which we use correctly sometimes and misuse at other times to help promote or hold back economic growth the governor of new jersey christine todd whitman just last week signed into law a 5percent tax reduction the kasich budget moves in the same direction with a 500perchild tax credit which would apply to districts all across the country not only to make it a little easier for families to come to grips with daily and weekly and monthly expenses but also to recognize what it is about our tax code that helps the economy to grow and that has been demonstrated time and time again as well so there is a difference here on the one hand we continue the taxandspend policies that have put us where we are today on the other hand with a vote for kasich which will come up in just a few minutes we have an opportunity to turn the corner on additional spending which requires as happened in 1990 additional

package that is being strongly supported by president clinton it is being supported by all of the living former presidents this morning a letter was circulated from all 10 living former secretaries of commerce supporting the north american freetrade agreement for a very simple and basic reasons they have all come to the conclusion that the north american freetrade agreement is in the best interest of the united states of america one of the things that has happened over the past several weeks and months is that the people have been led to believe that implementing the north american freetrade agreement is somehow a sellout of unitedstates interests actually nothing could be further from the truth in fact the opposite is the case when one looks at nafta i happen to believe that as we look at the challenge of the future nafta is in our best interest in fact as we listen to people who regularly stand here on the floor of the congress we listen to people out there in the country debating on television and radio programs the north american freetrade agreement we regularly hear horror stories about mexico about the flow of united states jobs from the united states of mexico 0 1930 we hear about problems that exist on the border we hear about the problem of illegal immigration which certainly affects my state of california our taxpayers in my state have to shoulder a 3 billion annual cost for illegal immigration we hear about the wave situation that exists in mexico we hear about human rights violations in mexico we hear about a lack of political pluralism in mexico we hear all these things and one would conclude that every one of these problems is taking place why because of nafta well nafta does not exist nafta is an agreement which will be struck among the three countries canada the united states and mexico and is proposed to go into effect january 1 1994 and be phased in over a 15year period so as we listen to the horror stories of united states jobs going to mexico as we listen to the horror stories of environmental problems on the border as we listen to the horror stories of human rights violations which have taken place in mexico as we listen to all these problems illegal immigration and all we have to realize that all these things have happened not because of nafta because there is no nafta i happen to believe that while every single one of these problems does exist the best way for us to counter these is by implementing nafta so basically the conclusion that i have drawn is that the north american freetrade agreement is about the future and not the past what we need to do is realize that we have some very serious economic problems right here in the united states i am privileged to be able to represent part of los angeles county here the unemployment rate in los angeles county is between 9 and 10 percent the unemployment rate statewide in california is right around 9 percent i happen to believe that the north american freetrade agreement is not just in the best interests of the state which i am privileged to represent here in the congress it is in the best interests of this country why because we desperately want to create job opportunities here in the united states all over the country the best way for us to do that is to realize that finding new markets for unitedstates manufactured goods and services is the best way to do that how do we do that by breaking down tariff barriers and that is what nafta is all about you know those who oppose the north american freetrade agreement do not offer a jobcreation strategy oh yes they say things with which i agree that we should reduce the capital gains tax rate here in the united states to create a business friendly government outlook here but we have this great opportunity 3 weeks from tomorrow when on november 17 we cast our vote on the north american freetrade agreement frankly if we pass this opportunityand there are many who have predicted defeat of the north american freetrade agreement i think we have a great chance to narrowly wth it i have said many times that if this were a secret ballot it would probably win by 75 votes why because as i have talked to colleagues on both sides of the aisle democrats and republicans they say they know it is in the best interest of the united states u america to pass nafta but they feel political pressure at home and for other reasons they do not think they can vote for it in fact more than a few have said to me they hope it passes but they feel they do not want to vote in support of it so clearly we have to look at the consequences of a potential defeat of nafta let me tell you basically what happens there is no doubt whatsoever that someone will export products like cars computers medical equipment telecommunications to mexico with nafta if we put it into place it will be the united states of america we will be the ones manufacturing automobiles telecommunications medical equipment computers other things to send into mexico without nafta it will just as likely be japan and the european community i have said many times that i am not one who likes to engage in bashing japan or the european community but i am the first to acknowledge that japan and the european community have benefited greatly since we played a role in rebuilding their economies their societies in the postwar world and what has happened is they would very much like to have the chance to get into the mexican economy there are 88 million consumers in mexico and if we defeat nafta they will have in mexico little choice other than to look towards japan the pacific rim and the european community for opportunities to trade why because the united states will have said to the neighbor their neighbor with which they share a 2 000mile border to the north the united states will have said forget it we dont want to do this now i have always said that as my friends talk about not this nafta we want to create a north american freetrade agreement i believe that is slightly disingenuous why because while this is a 2 000page agreement and i do not like every aspect of it and i am supporting nafta in spite of not because of the side agreements i am convinced they do not jeopardize unitedstates sovereignty as some have said but as we look at this package that is phased in over a 15year period and the reason it is so long is that the tariff structure is so great today that we need to work to bring it downbut as we look at those who say not this nafta we need to negotiate another nafta i say strike an agreement that will have the support of ross perot and pat buchanan jesse jackson jerry brown lyndon larouche ralph nader these people who came out and opposed nafta said there should be another nafta the aflcio i am hardpressed to believe that an agreement could be struck that would have all of the support of the aflcio and pat buchanan and at the same time jesse jackson so the fact of the matter is while it is not perfect and i realize i am the first to admit there is going to be some job displacementthat is what happens with free markets the free flow of goods and services that is the way it works i am convinced while this one is not perfect it clearly is far superior to the status quo and it does create an opportunity for the united states of america to have a tremendous tremendous advantage over the japanese and the european community let me explain why first of all we look at the tariff structure that exists today i would like to ask you to focus on these charts right here so that our colleagues most of whom are not here but i realize they may be seeing this in some other spot the tariff structure that exists today as a tariff that ranges between 10 and 20 percent for chemicals united statesmanufactured chemicals going into mexico where the united states tariff on chemicals from mexico is between zero and 4 percent under nafta for the united states and canada that tariff will be completely eliminated what we will see is we will see this tariff barrier of 10 to 20 percent maintained not for the united states but for the japanese and the european community look at pharmaceuticals on an average a 15percent mexican tariff is charged on united statesmanufactured goods going into mexico the average tariff that we impose on mexican pharmaceuticals coming into the united states is only 3 5 percent under nafta that is totally eliminated brought down to zero but for the japanese and the european communities it is still a 15percent average tariff barrier that wall will still be up giving the united states a greater advantage over our friends in japan and the european community in the textiles and apparels area 14 to 20 percent on average the mexican tariff that is charged a tax basically on united states textiles and apparel going into mexico6 percent is the average tariff that we have on mexican textiles and apparel coming into the united states this 14 to 20percent average tariff remains for japan and the european community but it comes down for the united states creating an opportunity for us to gain ancess to those 88 million consumers creating a chance for us to create jobs here in the united states and expand export opportunities for us so it seems to me we need to realize that nafta is clearly in the best interests of the united states let us go further industrial machinery on average a 10 to 17percent mexican tariff on united statesproduced industrial machinery going into mexico zero to 2 percent is the united states tariff on

manufacturers of industrial machinery will still face this 10to 17percent mexican tariff household appliances on average 17 1 percent is the mexican tariff on united statesmanufactured household appliances going into mexico less than 1 percent 0 8 percent is the average tariff charged on household appliances manufactured in mexico coming into the united states under nafta a total elimination of these barriers but 17 1 percent average tariff will be maintained for the japanese and the european community steelmill products on average 10 to 15percent mexican tariff on steelmill products coming from the united states into mexico 4 percent is our average tariff charged for mexicanmanufactured steelmill products coming into the united states under nafta totally eliminated but the 10 to

the tariff that the united states charges on mexicanmanufactured flat glass coming in is threetenths of 1 percent this tariff brought down to zero totally eliminated except for the japanese and the

tariff that is charged on united statesmanufactured machine tools going into mexico 2 percent is the average unitedstates tariff on mexican machine tools coming into the united states under nafta it comes down to zero free trade yet the 13 percent average is maintained for japan and the european community look at automobiles which is the item that is often discussed here and for the life of me as my friend the gentleman from florida chairman of the trade subcommittee says regularly he cannot understand why auto manufacturers and the workers would not support nafta why the tariff that mexico charges for united statesmanufactured automobiles a tax imposed on us to get our caft into mexico is 20 percent the united states tariff charged for manufacture of automobiles inmexico coming into the united states is only 2 2 percent under nafta it comes down to zero projections from the big three automakers are that we will see a 60 fold increase in the first year right now we export 1 000 automobiles from the united states into mexico under nafta the projections are that in the first year we will see an increase of 60 000 automobiles manufactured why because of the dramatic production that takes place and ultimately that tariff will be down to zero but m speaker the 20 percent tariff right here that mexico charges for automobiles coming in will be maintained for automobiles manufactured in japan for automobiles manufactured in germany for automobiles manufactured in italy or france or other countries but for the united states of america and canada under the north american freetrade agreement it will be zero so we will have a tremendous opportunity which is much greater than japan or germany to sell unitedstates manufactured automobiles to the 88 million consumers in mexico light trucks again 20 percent tariff that mexico charges right now for the united states to send light trucks into mexico our average again our tariff is 2 2 percent that we impose on mexican light trucks coming into the united states under nafta it comes down to zero free trade dramatic increase in our opportunity to export from the united states into mexico but the 20 percent tariff is maintained for japan and the european community auto parts 13 1 percent tariff is what the mexicans charge for united statesmanufactured auto parts going into mexico fourtenths of 1 percent you can see here is what is charged for mexicanmanufactured auto parts coming into the united states under nafta it comes down to zero but for japan and the european community it remains at 13 1 percent for auto parts so with these figures you can see very clearly that there is a tremendous benefit that is accrued to the unitedstates worker which will enhance opportunities for us to have this grand strategy of creating jobs let us look at computers i have often pointed to this and said as i will say again this evening that computers is something that is of great concern in my state of california we have a 10percent figure here but actually the tariff on computers manufactured in the united states going into mexico goes up to 20 percent it is 10 to 20 percent and the united states tariff on mexicanmade computers coming into this country is between 3 7 and 3 9 percent as you can see on this chart well what happens is under nafta we bring that tariff down to zero a great big zero nada but the tariff of 10 to 20 percent remains for japan and the european community now the specific example that i have cited in the area of computers i would llke to share again as we talk to the people in the coinputer industry the chief executive officer of ibm the international business machines has said that if nafta is defeated ibm will have no choice other than to move operations to mexico why because it is the only way that they can gain access to those 88 million consumers in america but if we put the north american freetrade agreement in place we can keep the jobs right here in the united states why because under nafta the tariff will come down to zero so that united states workers can continue to manufacture computer systems products software and export into mexico tariff free under nafta so i would like to see ibm keep its jobs here in the united states and with a zero tariff export into mexico now if we pass nafta remember that 10 to 20 percent tariff on computers which will be eliminated under nafta if we pass it will be maintained for computers coming from japan and the far east other countries in the world the european community so what happens the north american freetrade agreement is a great boost for the united states of america the unitedstates worker and it will clearly create more job opportunities for us here computer chips 10 percent right now we have zero tariff no tariff on computer chips from mexico coming into the united states they charge us 10 percent that tariff that 10 percent tax on the unitedstates worker going in under nafta both will be eliminated you can see there is obviously a humongous difference that exists today we have no tariff and they have a 10 percent tariff it goes down to zero computer chips from the u~ited states will go in ibm tandy other operations will not have to shift from the united states and open up their manufacturing operations in mexico but and once again this 10 percent tariff that is there for computer chips is maintained for japan the european community and other countries throughout the world in the area of electronics 2 6 percent average tariff on electronics that they charge on our goods coming in 2 4 percent on mexicanmanufactured electronics equipment coming into the united states it will go down to zero that 2 6 percent average will be maintained for taiwan singapore hong kong korea and japan and other countries which would desperately like to have access to the mexican market they would love to get to mexico so that they could use it for a staging ground an export platform if you will to send goods into the united states but i believe that we in this hemisphere should unite together recognizing that the wave of the future is to reduce barriers now let us look at the export industry here in the united states we found that on average workers here in the united states who manufacture items for export earn 17 percent more than workers here in the united states the workers here in the united states are compensated for items that are simply for domestlc consumption here in the united states so it is a 17percent wage improvement for those people who are in the export industries we also know that contrary to the argument that we regularly hear that the poor mexican people cannot afford to buy united states goods the middle income wage earner in mexico there are 20 millionof them almost the entire population of canada and these are the people who are desperately seeking the opportunity to purchase united statesmanufactured goods and services so it seems to me that we need to do everything we possible can to expand these opportunities for us to create jobs right here in the united states now as we look i mentioned a few minutes ago the people who oppose the north american freetrade agreement it consists of i mentioned all the defeated presidential candidates ross perot pat buchanan jesse jackson jerry brown ralph nader lyndon larouche all these people have run for president of the united states and they strongly oppose the north american trade agreement let us look for a moment at the people who support the north american freetrade agreement last month actually on september 1 all 12 of the living american nobel laureate economists joined with 264 other economists in sending a letter to president clinton in that letter the likes of paul samuelson milton friedman and others robert solow and james tobin who have received the nobel laureate in economics strongly supported the north american freetrade agreement in their letter and i have got it here it says and i quote specifically the assertions that the north american freetrade agreement will spur an exodus of united states jobs to mexico are without basis and i think that the points that i have made with these charts point to that now i should explain that let me say that as we look at other support i remember when we went to the white house and president clinton had former president ford former president bush and former president carter join in a ceremony with him he stood up and he talked about his experiences as a governor he had told me on other occasions that as a governor he knew of people that under the present situation had seen their jobs go to mexico and he said that as a former governor he knows that every single person who lives in a governors mansion of the 50 in this country wakes up in the morning and the first thing he or she thinks of is how am i going to create jobs for the people in my state people expect their governors to create jobs for them in their states and that is really their top priority and 41 of the 50 governors in this country democrats and republicans support the north american freetrade agreement and i think that as those who are out there here in washington members of congress talking about how jobs are going to be lost one cannot help but ask the question why is it that 41 of 50 governors all of whom have as their top priority every morning when they wake up creating jobs for their states why is it that 41 of the 50 strongly support the north american freetrade agreement the reason is very simply that they know that nafta is going to create jobs in their states and i say to my colleagues if you look at the past several years exports for all but two states in the union have increased from between 100 and 300 percent already even with the tariff structure that exists and that is how we have been able to go from what was a nearly 6 billion trade deficit in 1986 to what we had last year a 5 4 billion trade surplus the mexican consumers were buying 5 4 billion more in goods from us than we from them now i know that opponents say that so many of these goods simply go down to mexico and then are manufactured and then turn around and come back to the united states but 83 percent of the items which go from the united states to mexico stay in mexico and they are there for the mexican consumer i mentioned the fact that all 10 of the living commerce secretaries who here at the federal level have as their responsibility economic growth creating jobs spurring on the economy all 10 living former commerce secretaries have today signed this letter which strongly supports nafta democrats and republicans so as we look at this issue it is clear that we need to do everything that we possibly can to expand these opportunities mexico is our third largest export market and it is the 13th largest economy on the face of the earth and it is one of the fastest growing and we need to realize that while we have had slow economic growth in many parts of the united states mexicos economy is growing and so are the economies of other countries in latin america the other countries in latin america desperately want to see us pass the north american freetrade agreement and i believe that if we try to stick our heads in the sand and simply say that the united states of america can stand alone that we will actually be hurting ourselves more than anyone can imagine there are some very dire predictions as to what might happen if we do not pass the north american freetrade agreement and the best one i believe is h 8504 c that which i was referring to with these charts we extend an invitation to japan and the european community to come to mexico and utilize mexico as an export platform to embark on freetrade agreements with other countries in south america they ultimately want to join with us and i think that as we look at the cause of freedom and the fact that during the past 15 years we have seen incredible advances in technology we have seen incredible advances in our ability to communicate worldwide the natural step is to work to reduce barriers to the free flow of goods and services i say regularly that i do not believe that i as a member of the unitedstates congress have a right to say to the people whom i represent in california you cant buy the best quality product at the lowest possible price i think that we should be able to do that i believe that we should do everything that we can to increase unitedstates productivity i am convinced that the american worker is by far the most productive it was united states productivity that led general motors and the united auto workers to make a decision to move a plant from mexico back to lansing mi creating a thousand jobs right here in the united states why because the united states auto worker is actually nine times more productive than the mexican auto worker so as we look at these issues which are of concern i hope very much that our colleagues will do everything that they possibly can to look at the details and the facts on this i recognize that it is a tough political issue out in southern california i suppose i enhance their efforts by saying this but there are more than a couple of people many of whom are not actually constituents of mine but know that i have been in strong support of reducing trade barriers trying to increase export opportunities for the united states but these people have gone out and picketed and protested almost daily in front of my office in los angeles and i certainly welcome them i mean i know that some of the people in my office may not welcome them but i support their first amendment rights their right to free speech they have a right to stand there and voice their opinions on this but i believe that as we look at the facts on this that it is in the best interests of the united states to look toward the future and not the past and that is what i am trying to do and i hope that 3 weeks from tomorrow on november 17 that a majority of our colleagues in the unitedstates house of representatives will join with a majority of our colleagues in the unitedstates senate and pass the north american freetrade agreement"], [0.9855162501335144, 0.9855162501335144, 0, "i really want to pick up on that very important point that the gentleman from michigan has made on the length of time that we are trying to level out the united states with mexico and what the european community did i think we need to emphasize that more and more i think basically in the long term most of us believe that there has to be some kind of agreement along for the americas the point is what kind of an agreement and over what period of time the european community when they were bringing in greece spain and portugal which were three countries which had just about half of the wages of the rest of the european community their social standards were not that far apart but they had a 15year agreement to bring those three countries in at the end of each year those three countries had to reach a certain goal achieve a certain goal that had been set when they achieved that goal then they took the next step and the european community helped them it took 15 years for that and here we are in 3 years saying that the united states and mexico are

gentleman from new jersey for crafting a very thoughtful resolution that i think expresses and embodies our hopes as well as our concerns about the upcoming election in mexico when mexicans go to the polls in what is expected to be record numbers on august 21 the electoral process will reflect a confluence of political will presidential vision for reform compromise by the major political parties and insistence on integrity in the electoral process by mexican voters significantly more than 90 percent of the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes which promise to change the face of the electoral process in mexico the mexicans have faced many challenges throughout this electoral reform era and campaign season not the least of which is the trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican history as our neighbors south of the border elect a new president 500 members of the chamber of deputies 96 senate seats as

keep hearing that there was a reagan revolution there either was or there was not on the one hand they say there was a reagan revolution now they say there was not i was here in 1981 i know how it all happened i know that charlie halleck of indianaspeaking of indianaonce said he was the minority leader and leader of the majority because there were enough democrats with the republicans in the house to form a majority that is exactly what president reagan had during his first 4 years in officenot the second 4 but the first 4 years which set the pattern he had a majority in both houses in effect for his program that is why his program started why it got passed he had a net tax cut in the first 4 years of about half a trillion dollars because he had a 750 billion cut in the 1981 act and that means that one defense contractorwho by the way in 3 years with a 20 billion profit paid absolutely nothing in taxes to the unitedstates government most of which he made from the government and he also signed in real dollars the highest tax increase in history including this one in 1993 dollars 308 billion it was 200 billionsome then that is what really occurred the spending was increased 1 trillion in mr reagans first 4 years to be fair with him some of that was social security but essentially the social programs were cut as everybody knows that was the reagan revolution was it not and the increases were in four areas they were in farm subsidies mr reagans farm subsidy which passed was exactly six times the size of mr carters farm program in 1980 by the mid1980s it was in foreign aid it was in the space program and of course it was in military procurement that is where the spending increases took place some of us think that it was wrong to take the load off at the same time that you are increasing spending but some of us thought that there was a laughableor laffer curve that was going to make all that balance the budget in 1984 well it did not happen the democratic plan

that please follow me what is the problem here that concerns people is it not the fundamental concern of the mixing of private money with public policy if that is the problem the mixing of private money with public policy is not the solution to eliminate the private money public financing however we cannot achieve public financing the public does not support public financing i would suggest

financing so we can drive the private money out of the system does not the next question become what is the best kind of private money to have mixing with public policy and does not the answer follow the most accountable kind of private money the one we can see and trace and know about most readily question what kind of private money is that the answer is the political action committee there is a reason that americans know about pacs the reason is they are easy to track they are regularly reported on they are editorialized about they are used by opponents in campaigns information about pacs is readily available it tells us who gave how much money to whom and what interest they represent large individual contributions on the other hand are infinitely harder to track they are much harder to correlate it is much harder to determine with specificity what special interest they may represent they are much harder for the media or for an opponent or the people to know about it is much harder to know with a private large individual contribution who gave how much money to whom and what interest do they represent if we cannot drive private money out of the system if we cannot get to public financing or if we philosophically do not want to get to public financing do not please do not as the republican substitute would do drive that private money back under the table which is what will

now at the top of the list the bia supports the immediate recognition they have reviewed their petition they are a tribe they are a tribe in the bias opinion i do not think we need to go through the convincing evidence that this tribe has already submitted they have submitted convincing evidence that they are the political successors to the signatories of several treaties between the potawatomis

the treaty of the rapids of the miami of lake erie 1817 the treaty of st marys 1818 the treaty of chicago 1821 the treaty of the mississinewa on the wabash 1826 the treaty of st joseph 1827 the treaty of st joseph 1828 the treaty of tippecanoe river 1832 and the treaty of chicago 11 1833 this tribe secured the rights to remain in michigan and i think as the gentleman from california mentioned in 1935 they were ac knowledged by the commissioner of indian affairs you are indians however we dont have any money so you cant become an indian tribe in the 1800s as the gentleman from montana mentioned they petitioned delay broken promises 1935 broken promises because they were told oh yes you are indians but we cannot give you any money so here we sit today with a great native american lineage i dare one member to say to these native americans that they are not because their lineage of being first americans is probably stronger than many of us here in this chamber if not everyone in this chamber and in this country so we are going to fix this process there is no question it needs help there is no question this committee is committed as the gentleman from california said to do that we have legislation we plan to move it in september it sets up an independent commission it sets time deadlines it tells the bia they have got to based on historical record and not bureaucracy

of the former soviet union in our efforts to strengthen democracy in russia we must not ignore the equally important democratic challenges facing us in newly independent nations such as ukraine unfortunately last year this is exactly what happened russia received 62 percent of all the freedom support act funds in comparison ukraine received less than onetenth of what russia got on a per capita basis ukraine was third from last of all the former soviet republics only uzbekistan and azerbaijan received less per capita and azerbaijan is ineligible to receive aid because of its blockade of armenia we must address this unbalance in aid levels the economic and political transition in ukraine and the other former soviet republics are no less difficult than in russia and deserve our attention with 52 million people ukraine is the fifthlargest nation in europe it was the industrial base of the soviet union and breadbasket of the entire region it is imperative that we strengthen our ties with ukraine ukraine has legitimate security concerns that must be addressed for good reasons ukrainians feel dwarfed by russia they remember the czarist treatment of ukraine stalins

being approached on a more equitable basis les aspin and strobe talbot made some constructive proposals last week in kiev the administration is correct in reversing the bush policy of isolating ukraine this sentiment was echoed in a washington post editorial this weekend the aid provided under this legislation must reflect this new approach language that is in the report is a promising step in this direction i agree that we must initiate a larger more effective assistance program for ukraine our bestinterest will be served by helping all of the new democratic nations as long as these

once the program was in place this member successfully pushed in the authorizing committee for the income limits of the program to be expanded from a top limit of 100 percent of median area income to a top income of 115 percent of median area income in order to match the eligibility limits of the existing hud programs for urban areas the 329 5 million in loan guarantee authority appropriated in fiscal 1993 was completely allocated in the first 6 months of this fiscal year congress recently passed a supplemental bill to provide another 250 million in loan guarantee authority for the program

river in effect is flooding over st charles county it is a 7 or 8mile lake if you fly over it it is truly a terrible dreadful awesome experience to see that there are two points i want to make to the house today first of all the devastation in my district is similar to the devastation in other peoples districts around the country 7 000 people out of their homes people desperately in need of shelter food people dislocated people concerned about the future farmers having lost their crops at a time in the growing season when it is impossible to replant and recover as would be if this flood had occurred in april or may but the volunteer effort in response is the silver lining in this terrible cloud fifty thousand people in my district alone have volunteered to help out they have sandbagged they have served food they have taken people into their homes they are doing the best they can to deal with this terrible problem i think everybody recognizes that the response is basically going to have to be on the local and state levels the second point i want to make i want to make to the people who believe as i believe that we should have paid for this disaster relief by saving from other areas rather than by borrowing money i think it is appropriate for us to raise those issues i would have preferred that we pass the flood relief bill and that we do it through savings now we have the opportunity to pass the flood relief bill and the only opportunity we have is to do it through borrowing i think that is appropriate now as it was appropriate to raise those issues and it is appropriate to put those behind us but people in the midwest are waiting to see if the federal government and the congress can unite in an effort and can support them in what they are trying to do to help themselves and their neighbors it is more than just the money more than just the loans to the farmers it is important at this time as the people are laboring under week after week after week of strain that we show that we can pull together i urge people in the house people on both sides of the aisle those who have doubts as i have and still have about how we are funding this measure to pull

areas where the federal government should be involved infrastructure is one of them we need good roads we need good bridges we need highways so that the commerce of this country can get its job done that is a legitimate function of government i support that but there are other areas where government should be limited in its involvement and this is one area where i think government should be limited i understand we have differences of opinion but i feel very strongly about this one of the previous speakers said that tax credits or tax incentives are coming out of the treasury so it is a wash as to whetl~er we do that or do what is advocated with this spending for the rural development grants let me just say that tax credits overall and tax incentives for the private sector to hire the hardcore unemployed and to hire the welfare recipients and to hire those who are in abject poverty and find them jobs and teach them useful skills sure it would cost some money in the short run but in the long run those people getting those welfare benefits would no longer be recipients and they would be taxpayers and statistics show that the people who get off of welfare and start getting a job and start paying taxes are not a drain on the treasury they are a real plus and in the short run those tax incentives to the private sector to the businessman who would teach them useful skills is a great incentive whereas continued government subsidies and government support just digs us deeper and deeper and deeper in the same hole for example last year we increased food stamp moneys by 20 percent in i year food stamps went up 20 percent in 1 year in this agriculture bill last year how is that solving a problem it is not whereas if we had had some kind of a program to create tax incentives to teach those unemployed useful skills and get them employed by industry we could have gotten them off of the welfare rolls and instead of food stamps and unemployment compensation and other things going up we probably would have had it going down and it would have been less of a drain on the treasury each 1 percent of unemployment costs the taxpayers 41 billion in this country so let me just say there are times when the government should be involved infrastructure is one of them because we have to have that infrastructure to make sure that commerce moves in this country but we must minimize the role of government if members do not believe that just look at the last 20 years government has gotten more and more involved with entitlements more government programs more government regulations and we are strangling the free enterprise system if members do not believe it go and talk to any businessman who provides jobs those jobs going overseas out of the country so that we have to start making hard choices and prioritize spending that is why i say right here we are not cutting the spending we are just freezing at last years spending level and that is not too

30 30 corporations in my state are going to see their income taxes go up out of 32 000 that file income tax returns why because only 30 corporations are making more than the 10 million that triggers
