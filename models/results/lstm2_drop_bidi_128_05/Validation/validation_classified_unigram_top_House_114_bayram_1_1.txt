puget sound we give thanks for our salmon we give thanks for all the natural beauty that surrounds us and we give thanks that billy frank jr was in our lives as was indicated earlier in addition to the many other awards he received in his lifetime just last week the president conferred upon billy frank jr posthumously the presidential medal of freedom it is literally no exaggeration to suggest that what martin luther king meant to civil rights and nelson mandela meant to south africa billy frank jr meant to the entire pacific northwest indeed to indigenous people throughout the globe he is a fitting person for the prestigious honor that we hope to bestow on him today we have an opportunity to do something todayand i recommend we seize itto preserve his legacy in the place he called home billy frank jr was indeed the foremost advocate for restoration of native american fishing treaty rights in the pacific northwest he cherished clean water and healthy salmon runs he was a key voice in the recovery of the puget sound he also as has not been mentioned proudly served our nation in the united states marine corps he was an mp i believe during the korean war he got along with everyone he was open and inclusive his energy was literally infectious we were deeply stunned in may of 2014 that he passed away even though at the age of 83 we thought billy would live forever he is gone but his spirit is not and his story is not his courage and belief in us is here because you see billy wandered the halls of congress frequently and testified numerous times he respected this institution and he was a powerful voice within our chambers his story is in the nisqually national wildlife refuge in the 10th congressional district which i have the privilege to represent which we now protect to give our wildlife a clean and sustainable home billy grew up at a place called franks landing which is literally just a hop skip and a jump from the refuge he fished in the nisqually river in and next to the area where the refuge is now that is the location where he was arrested more than 50 times for advocating for his treaty fishing rights this bill will rename that refuge after billy frank jr also as has been indicated it calls for the establishment of a national memorial at the exact place of the signing of the medicine creek treaty in 1854 that was the first treaty in the state of washington between indian people and the newly established territorial government in this case it was between the people of the nisqually the puyallup squaxin island and the muckleshoots throughout his storied career people often asked billy how is it you do this get up every day and so effectively advocate on behalf of clean water and good fish runs how do you do that decade after decade he would always tell them the same thing tell your story so when people go to the billy frank jr nisqually national wildlife refuge they will be able to see why he held fishins they will see why he risked arrest they will see why he ultimately worked with others to help protect his home like many young people today he fought for what he believed in but later worked with lawmakers to build consensus he started out as a civil rights protestor civilly disobedient and an advocate he ended up being one of the great uniters in the history of the nation and certainly the pacific northwest i hope that when people drive by the sign that directs them to the refuge maybe they will feel a little of that billy magic too maybe they will wonder well who was this billy frank jr what did he do for those of us who knew him it will be a frequent reminder of this hero they say you die twice the first time and the second time when they stop speaking about you it is our goal that they never stop speaking about billy frank jr and the lessons he taught us all the refuge will be a constant reminder i knew billy for almost 40 years i loved him like a beloved uncle in fact i called him uncle billy

appreciate the leadership of our newer members of the budget committee especially the member from arkansas i think the people of arkansas were right to send him to congress not only does he come ready to identify the spending problems that this country has but he comes ready with solutions too and i think that is in essence the definition of leadership i thank the gentleman i also thank the gentleman from georgia who just spoke he speaks so eloquently on so many subjects a member of the rules committee i am also very appreciative of his contribution to the budget committee he of course as we all are today and almost every day unfortunately was talking about the debt and let me just put it in a pictorial form this is the new red menace look at that trajectory it goes nearly vertical so the question is how do you turn that big ship that titanic if you will so number one it doesnt sink this entire country and number two it gets on a more meaningful more productive course so that we can continue to be the worlds best hope in a 21st century world now some especially those on the other side of the aisle will immediately turn to the fact that there are two ways to in fact solve this problem one is to control spending the other is to grow revenue let me talk about the latter for just a second the latter is a false choice because at 10 000 people a day retiring into unreformed social programs that trajectory will not turn around it will not plateau no matter how much property you confiscate from the american people no matter how much you take in the form of taxes with 10 000 people a day retiring in unreformed programs can you get that to go down so lets look at that more closely this is what the federal government confiscates from the american people to run itself in fiscal year 2015 it was 3 25 trillion revenue we took in to run the operations of just the federal government the american people know we dont have a revenue problem we have a spending problem the question should be what cant you do what cant you do with 3 25 trillion of property confiscated more revenue is not the answer thankfully the majority here in the house of representatives doesnt think it is the answer either we know we can do better we know we have to do better for the american people we know we have to control the spending that is why i am very proud to be part of a committee the budget committee and part of a new crew that came starting in 2011 that for every year we have put in a budget a narrative something that we dont legally have to do as part of the budget process but we took the extra step to put a narrative in our budget to give the solutions that are needed to correct this debt problem reforming medicare reforming medicaid putting us on a track that will reduce that red menace that will plateau it and start pointing it downward over the next generation we took the political risk to have that conversation with the american people and we have done it every year since 2011 some people called it the third rail of politics touch it and you will be politically electrocuted well we touched it and we touched the next year and the next year and the year after that and my hope and my pledge is on this house floor that we will continue to have that conversation with the american people backed up with votes that show really how to solve this problem i will refer us to the spending that i am talking about this chart was used before by the gentleman from arkansas i will refer to it again here is what is on autopilot here is what needs to be reformed and if you look at one piece of that pie there medicaid a solution for that has been in our budget for the last 5 years in the remaining time i have i want to talk about that solution a state flexibility grant block grant if you will we have had that idea in our budget for the last 5 years it is the idea that we in the federal government we are going to get out of the business of medicaid we are going to get out of the business of deciding who is poor in terms of health care what the poor need in terms of health care or how the poor get it that health care service we are going to give it to the states to individuals to locally elected officials people who know their communities better in fact than any federal bureaucrat does people who can determine given a finite amount of money from us their money back in fact what the poor need who the poor really are who the disabled really are what they should get in terms of healthcare services and how they should get it maybe like the gentleman from arkansas alluded to earlier maybe there ought to be a work requirement for the ablebodied ones of them maybe there ought to be other conditions but let the states decide what that would be pressured in a good way by the fact that there would only be a finite amount of money coming from our budget that would allow us to know exactly what we are in for as a federal government exactly what we are giving out and not a cent more and would naturally incentivize the states to innovate to come up with better ways of service to serve those who really need health care who cant get it any other way and those who in fact are gaming the system will be naturally forced off the states are in the best position to provide that when they are properly incentivized with a finite amount of money that doesnt grow over time the republican budget for the last 5 years the one that has passed this house of representatives has done that very thing we are on the right track we need to continue these votes we need to continue to have a budget we need to continue to have standalone votes on these reforms to take this issue to the american people especially in a presidential election year when frankly the candidates i havent seen them talk enough about what is really on peoples minds and that is how they are going to leave their children and grandchildren with a better life than they have when we are knowingly saddled with 19 trillion in debt a very hard thing to do in fact i think this is the first generation in american history that is poised to leave the next generation worse off i refuse to let that happen on this budget committees watch and that is why we are here today that is why we are providing the leadership i thank the gentleman very much for his leadership"],

the administrations iran deal1 year and the world has already become a more troubled place i personally think the deal sets a dangerous precedent it strengthens the largest state sponsor of terror in the world and gives that state sponsor of terror a pathway to nuclear weapons at some point in its future i think that all of the arguments to defend this deal cant stand against the great weight of reality including the fact that iran isnt holding up its side of the bargain and is more interested in embarrassing american military men and women than in becoming a responsible nation i understand a few people disagree however there is something we have always agreed on from the start deal or no deal good or bad deal we have always agreed to hold iran accountable for terrorism for its development of ballistic missiles and for its human rights abuses committed against its own people in april alone president obama said we have to hold iran to account where it is acting in ways that are contrary to rules and norms secretary kerry said last year we will never ever stop standing up for the iranian peoples rights treasury secretary jack lew also said last year we are going to continue to prosecute our unilateral sanctions on things like terrorism on things like regional destabilization and human rights what about today iran has conducted eight ballistic missile tests since the deal was signed the state departments own stephen mull said in may there have not been any sanctions imposed for human rights grounds since july of last year iran continues to imprison journalistsamericansand to torture its people in february the administrations director of national intelligence james clapper said iran continues to be the foremost state sponsor of terrorism iran and hezbollah remain a continuing terrorist threat to unitedstates interests and partners worldwide those are the facts right there what has the obama administration done how has the administration held iran accountable as they said they would the administration has done nothing and it only gets worse german intelligence has found that iran is violating its pledges under this nuclear deal iran is procuring material for nuclear weapons in what is by international standards a quantitatively high level coupled with its missile program the report reads it is safe to expect that iran will continue its intensive procurement activity wasnt this deal supposed to stop iran from developing nuclear weapons where is the accountability where is the administration when they so clearly said they would hold them accountable where is the bipartisanship in the sanctions now now i understand on the other side some will accuse republicans of engaging in a purely partisan exercise and never intending to work with our friends on the other side of the aisle well you know that is just not true you know for the last 6 months we worked with the other side of the aisle we worked in a bipartisan manner with the chairmen on both sides but every time we would deal with the missiles and the ballistic sanctions against them the white house would thwart any bipartisan effort so why are we here today it is because for 6 months he found every reason to say no for 6 months he went back on every word that was said about holding them accountable when the facts stood before us frankly i dont understand opposition to this bill we are simply holding iran accountable which is exactly what the administration said they would do we have had tremendous leaders in this country and we have learned the lessons time and again ronald reagan taught us this lesson that peace without freedom is meaningless human nature craves that we all have peace but you cannot secure peace without freedom we have watched in history when leaders have failed chamberlain peace for our time but there was no freedom in that ronald reagan had this same dilemma late in his second term in iceland when he stood across from gorbachev trying to negotiate a reduction in nuclear weapons he was securing almost everything that he had asked for but gorbachev asked for one last item he asked that america would end their sdi program reagan didnt say no he said we will share it with you so the world can be safe but gorbachev said no reagan had a decision to make he could have signed that deal and i am sure the elite would have probably given him the nobel peace prize other presidents have won them but he realized there was no freedom in that agreement so he got up he held the soviet union accountable and he walked away had he not would the berlin wall have collapsed had he not would the soviet union have collapsed words have meaning and words have consequences the quotes from this administration and from around the world were to hold iran accountable that is what is happening today there are going to be some members in this chamber who will sit back and say but it didnt happen just the way i wanted it to before it came to the floor i dont want you to look your grandchildren in the eyes and explain to them why we dont have freedom in the world i want you to look your grandchildren in the eyes and

dear to my heart cheaper than cigarettes and more accessible than alcohol heroin has become a plague on communities all across our country heroin takes a life every 3 days in the chicago suburbs unfortunately a similarly deadly trend is taking place all over our nation although heroin is not often considered a serious suburban problem statistics show the epidemic is quickly growing nearly onequarter of the people who try heroin become addicted and heroin deaths have literally quadrupled in the united states in less than a decade but the statistics dont even begin to tell the whole story as the cochair of the suburban antiheroin task force in the state of illinois i have seen firsthand the deadly impact of these drugs but i still cant even begin to fathom the pain of losing one of my children to a drug overdose i cant imagine what families throughout the country have been put through because of this terrible drug there is hope thanks to the great work of the lake county opioid initiative live4lali and many other organizations in the 10th congressional district we have already had tremendous success saving lives with an overdose reversal aid called naloxone 1045 stopped by an overdose first responders in lake county illinois have now saved over 56 lives in just a little over 1 year that is 56 families who wont have to experience the same type of unbearable pain as those who have lost a loved one with increased access the world health organization predicts that naloxone could save an additional 20 000 lives each and every year that is why i introduced a new bipartisan piece of legislation this week with congresswoman katherine clark our bill lalis law will help states increase access to naloxone the bill is named in memory of stevenson high school graduate alex laliberte who sadly passed away from a drug overdose alex like many high school students played sports at stevenson high school he did well at school he cared about his friends he cared about his family but during his sophomore year of college he began being hospitalized for what was a mysterious illness unknown to his family and to the doctors alex had an addiction to prescription drugs and was being hospitalized for his withdrawal he would stay in the hospital until he received his fix leave the hospital and repeat the cycle again and again he continued this pattern until he died of an overdose a few days after his final exams the primary purpose of this bill is to help fund state programs that allow pharmacists to distribute naloxone without a prescription so that we can prevent the repeat of alexs story many states use these programs to allow local law enforcement officers to carry and use naloxone just like the success we have already seen in lake county the police officers in lake county asked to be able to carry it because they would come to a scene often faster than the paramedics they could respond within 5 minutes and refused to sit idly by and watch these people die of an overdose lalis law is an example of what is possible when we set aside partisanship and get to work for the people that we represent lalis law will bring alexs story to the united states congress here and amplify the lifesaving benefits of live4lalis hard work and the work that they did to pass a similar piece of legislation in the illinois state legislature it is my hope that through this bipartisan bill alexs lasting legacy will include helping countless people get a second chance at recovery and saving their families from unbearable heartbreak i urge my colleagues to

and physical strength of the person fighting the disease it has a deep and lasting impact on family friends and communities currently more than 100 different types of cancer exist but in my humble opinion none is more wicked than breast cancer this is most likely because breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers among women in fact one in eight women in america will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime breast cancer can be a cruel disease it tears mothers from their children wives from their husbands and daughters from their parents in 2015 it is anticipated that in our country alone more than 40 000 women will die from breast cancer while women are most at risk we must remember that this disease does not just affect women while less common in the united states 2 350 men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the past 20 years there have been incredible advances in the research and medicine surrounding breast cancer but there is much left to be done we cant rest until we can prevent or cure this horrible disease again we have already made huge strides in the fight against breast cancer death rates due to breast cancer have been declining since 1989 and women younger than 50 are now less likely to get breast cancer than ever before this is largely due to the awareness that has been raised on the importance of selfexams and yearly doctor physicals however currently 29 percent of insured women are still not receiving mammograms and for women without health insurance the percentage is even higher with 68 percent not receiving mammograms it is extremely important that we continue to place an emphasis on early detection so that we can catch this disease as early as possible and have the best shot at beating it while there are factors like genetics and age that can make someone more susceptible to the disease breast cancer does not discriminate against education upbringing or wealth from ceos in new york city to a stayathome mom in small town minnesota this disease knows no bounds i expect that just about everyone who walks these halls and too many to count across our country have been impacted by
