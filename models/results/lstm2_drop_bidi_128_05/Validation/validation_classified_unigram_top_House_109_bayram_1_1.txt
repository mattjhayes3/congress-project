warning system we know exactly what when and where the damage will be because the republican budget once again puts the tax cuts of the few above the needs of the many under 1he republican budget the vast majority of americans are asked to sacrifice with one exception the wealthy who can most afford to give something up their tax cutsthe same tax cuts that brought us unprecedented deficitsare protected and even extended under this proposal they will cost our country an additional 106 billion of which 75 percent will go to people making over 200 000 a year in order to pay for those tax cuts the republicans are literally proposing to take away food and health care from lowincome families kill 48 education programs by eliminating the 4 3 billion that funds them slash veterans health careincluding cutting 9 million from medical and prosthetic research and undermine community development in struggling neighborhoods by cutting 1 5 billion in grantprograms despite republican claims these cuts will do nothing to help our countrys bottom line but they will be devastating for the children working families veterans and seniors who will be asked to go without this is not only irresponsible but immoral in the that state of illinois we could see the earned income tax creditthe most effective antipoverty program cut by 164 2 million temporary assistance for needy families and child care grants lose 84 3 million and supplemental security incomewhich helps poor seniors and people with disabilitiesslashed by 174 million thousands of vulnerable peoples lives will be destroyed

medicaid cuts included in this budget resolution are unwise unjustifiable and almost certainly lethal as health care costs continue to rise the number of uninsured americans exceeds 45 million and employers continue to cut back on coverage medicaid has provided a guarantee of support for pregnant women and children persons with disabilities persons living with aids or mental illnesses and senior citizens needing medical care or long term care services without those services millions of americans will no longer be able to get the physical health mental health and long term care services

costeffective course to take medicaid costs less tlan private health insurance and its per capita costs are growing more slowly than private insurance premiums but if the republican budget cuts re enacted it may no longer be there for the millions of americans who have no other source of careother than bankrupting their families or mortgaging their futures to pay for their parents long term care needs or their childrens medical services budgets are not just about numbers they are about values and priorities based on the republicans proposal maintaining and making permanent tax cuts for millionaires has been and continues to be a higher priority than meeting the needs of the majority of americans and they are shifting the responsibility of their fiscal mess onto the backs of our children who will see decreased services and will be asked to deal with deficits for years to come the democratic and cbc budgets recognize that this is the wrong thing to do and a great threat to our

by mr hunter mr hunters resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal from iraq is a political stunt and an outrageous politicization of a serious proposal offered by congressman jack murtha a respected leader in the congress mr hunters resolution shows great disrespect to someone of mr murthas stature and is a discredit to his years of service from the beginning this war has been conducted without oversight democrats have repeatedly asked for substantive hearings on the war in iraq in addition we have requested investigations on the misuse of intelligence by the bush administration war is too important of an issue to politicize the lives of our soldiers despite democrats request for hearings on torture contract fraud and the leak of confidential national security information it goes without saying that the war in iraq is not going as advertised our troops have become the primary target of the insurgency they are united against unitedstates forces and we have become a catalyst for violence unitedstates troops are the common enemy of the sunnis saddamists and foreign jihadists i believe with unitedstates troop redeployment the iraq security forces will be incentivized to take control a poll recently conducted shows that over 80 percent of iraqis are strongly opposed to the presence of coalition troops about 45 percent of the iraqi population believe attacks against american troops are justified i believe we need to turn iraq over to the iraqis i believe before the iraqi elections scheduled for mid december the iraqi people and the emerging government must be put on notice that the united states will immediately redeploy all of iraq must know that iraq is free free from united states occupation i believe this will send a signal to the sunnis to join the political process for the good of a free iraq the unitedstates needs to vacate iraq both to splinter the insurgent factions that have united against us and to create incentives for the iraqis to take on their own security not surprising is the fact that the american people have realized this for months it is just now that some democrats and republicans alike are beginning to express grave concerns

is auto mechanics not rocket science i then offered an amendment in the resources committee to strip a provision from the bill that would open the arctic national wildlife refuge for oil drilling the republicans on that committee voted against my amendment choosing to set up a gas station in this pristine national refuge if we allow drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge we will forever ruin this unique wilderness and allow the oil industry to target all 540 national wildlife refuges for drilling and exploitationall for a few meager months worth of oil furthermore drilling in the

judgment of a locality when it uses eminent domain for the purpose of economic development we were elected to the united states congress not to local city councils mr chairffian it is impossible for congress to draw a bright line principle separating those cases in which economic development is appropriate for a particular area and when it is not the constitution does require that the taking be for public use it is the role of a city council to weigh the needs of a particular community and consider when the government should use eminent domain sometimes that might mean taking property for the purpose of economic development sometimes it may not sometimes we will agree with the judgment of the locality sometimes we will disagree i cannot think of a more fitting example of the quagmire this bill presents than the situation we have right here in washington d c where they are trying to build a baseball stadium i find it ironic that at the same time we are marking up the bill washington d c is using eminent domain to build a baseball stadium the debate on this bill has already exposed the shortcomings of the legislation for example we found that if a stadium were built and owned by the city at taxpayer expense it would clearly be allowed under the bill on the other hand if the owner offered to build a stadium at his own expense that might not be allowed the bill requires public access to the stadium as a matter of right does that mean that the skyboxes must be put to public auction or can the owner pick and choose which businesses can acquire rights to skyboxes anybody who surveys baseball or football stadiums around the country will find all kinds of public and private and joint publicprivate ownership combinations could some use eminent domain while others be prohibited from using eminent domain based on the fact that they want to limit access to skyboxes or how the title of the stadium is held the world trade cen ter and lincoln center in new york the baltimore inner harbor even president bushs baseball stadium in houston texas were all made possible by eminent domain takings for the purpose of economic development and although we might agree or disagree with the wisdom of these projects most would agree that they should not have been illegal these are political decisions that ought to be left to the localities within the confines of their state legislatures parameters if congregs cannot leave eminent domain to the states then we should focus on the real issues involved in eminent domain we should require for example that just compensation should include replacement cost not just technical appraisal value we should require that relocation expenses be paid to owners and tenants as written the bill does nothing to ensure that displaced individuals receive reasonable compensation for the replacement value and relocation expenses the bill does nothing to ensure compensation for loss of goodwill of a business nothing to ensure that due consideration is given for the length of time a family or business has been at a particular location nothing in the bill deals with the fact that the poor and minorities are usually the victims of eminent domain abuses let us put some protections in the bill so that those who are relatively weak politically can be protected from unfair use of eminent domain i would like to place in the record at this point letters from the national league of cities the national conference of state legislatures and the national association of housing and redevelopment officials i believe that the decisionmaking power of eminent domain should remain at the state and local level and that congressional attempts to define when eminent domain is reasonable and when it is not will

resolution is both timely and appropriate we all agree that the unitedstates faces a difficult task in the coming days and months ahead in iraq we must maintain enough of a presence to allow the newly elected government to survive but not so much as to undermine its legitimacy thus the plan is to turn over control on an aggressive schedule as soon as iraqi forces are able to handle the jobs themselves the objective is to create a democratic government that is able to manage its own affairs and keep the civilian population safe this entails a gradual turnover of responsibility to iraqi troops and an incremental redeployment of american forces the schedule of withdrawals must be based solely on the iraqis ability to handle the job not an arbitrary timetable furthermore the message from elected leaders must be that troop withdrawals are part of a plan not due to the fact that we are tired of being there as you know there have been many successes in iraq notwithstanding the violent insurgency that seeks to thwart democratic change there has been economic progress in every sector of iraq and as we have all witnessed there has been significant political progress as well yesterday approximately eleven million of the fifteen million eligible iraqi voters participated in their national elections this represents over 70 percent voter turnouteven larger than the 10 million who participated in the referendum on the new constitution in october and the eight million who voted for their interim government last january we can view this as yet another positive sign that the disparate ethnic and religious sects have opted to engage in the political process rather than civil war in fact 82 percent of iraqis polled believe their lives will be better in a year and there is reason to share their optimism however there is also the need to have realistic expectations although they are making progress iraqi troops are not yet selfsufficient iraqi forces do control and police more than onethird of baghdad in addition iraqi forces also secure fallujah mosul and tal afar and most of the syrian border american military commanders estimate that approximately 100 000

reduce hazardous fuel and the yearly threat of wildfire throughout the west the gao recently stated that at these anemic spending levels we will continue to fall further and further behind the gao says that if we doubled the funding for fuel reduction we would only stay even with the problem earlier this year when the agency testified before the forests subcommittee on which i serve they said we would need to triple the funding for fuel reduction if we wish to begin to address the buildup of dangerous trees and shrubs in our national forests if we tripled the overall funding more than 30 percent of that money could be spent under the expedited environmental analysis and judicial review authorized by hfra instead of using budget gimmicks to only claim 1hat we are fully funding that important law but the administration thus far has used that authority on less than 10 percent of projects and the vast majority of those projects are imply burning rangeland which does virtually nothing to improve forest health and reduce wildfire risk the bottom line is that we are not oven beginning to address the fuel buildup problem on forested federal land and we wont start with this

telescope the spitzer space telescope we now have telescopes in orbit around the earth that have identified up to 160 planets around other solar systems nasa has discovered as the chairman just

with the legal standard established by the unitedstates supreme court pertaining to the reasonable nature of student searches as such the bill enjoys a tremendous consensus of support includ ing leading teacher unions and school safety advocates these groups support the commonsense steps that this bill will take and i include a letter from the national education association for the record at this point"], [0.042853862047195435, 0.45714613795280457, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise just in reply to my colleague who is chairman of the judiciary committee who made some points in terms of jurisdiction and also made some points that the bill has minimum impact upon the budget i have here a copy of the amendment which is part of the managers amendment that we have next in place which takes care of the concerns he has by striking a portion of the bill and in place putting it that the bill is selfsufficient and the money that is appropriated comes from the licensure fees so i would urge the gentleman to vote for the managers amendment which will be coming up shortly that will take care of his main concern which appears to be that he is concerned it was 5 million the first year and the gao audit indicated more money thereafter but with this managers amendment the gao audit is nullified and we have a selfsufficient bill another point i would like to make is the basic thrust of the bill is a 12year supervision with three appointees on the commission from the president of the united states with 3year duration of tenure at that point they can be reappointed or they can continue at the presidents request we have in place something here that is very rare on the house floor and that is something that is sunsetted so when people talk about a new federal bureaucracy let me be perfectly clear this is a very very light temporary government oversight committee to bring accountability and to bring justice to a great american sport everybody in the business who testified wants this type of temporary structure so i think in a larger sense we have to say to ourselves now is the time to do this and in so doing in this way we will do the least amount of harm by making it temporary and at the same time asking them to pick up the ball and run with this as a voluntary organization much like other professional sports do so i am glad to rise to point out to my colleague that it is going to be amended so that it is budget neutral and two to point out to him that this is not a new federal bureaucracy but instead an oversight board to help guide this sport to its ultimate success i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
