with private debt collection agencies in order to collect delinquent federal debts my colleagues are already aware of the massive debts owed to the federal government and of the enormous amount of this debt that is delinquent mismanagement on the part of bureacrats has permitted these delinquent debts to accumulate the details of the problem are described in the recently issued report of the office of management and budget debt collection project on may 18 1981 the house passed h r 2811 a bill designed to help agencies manage their debts in a more businesslike fashion and to make agency debt collection activities more effective that bill was only one step in the effort to improve debt collection practices and to increase the revenue from delinquent debts because agencies have such a poor track record in managing their debts we must recognize that there may be times when agencies need assistance that is what the bill i have introduced today will do it will authorize and regulate the use of private debt collection agencies by the federal government i hope that use of private debt collectors in appropriate circumstances will increase the repayment of debts owed to the federal government i am convinced that use of these private collectors can be done in a way that is consistent with the right to privacy the rules that govern the contracting out of government functions and the laws that regulate debt collection practices this bill is necessary because it is not clear under present law that agencies have the authority to enter into contracts for debt collection services for many years the general accounting office took the position that federal agencies could not legally delegate the debt collection function to private contractors in order to overcome this restriction congress found it necessary to expressly authorize the use of private debt collectors for a specific category of debts in the education amendments of 1976 public law 94482 i was surprised when the general accounting office and the department of justice reversed this interpretation and amended the regulations for the federal claims collection act the amended regulations require agencies to consider contracting for debt collection services this rule change appeared in the federal register for april 17 1981 no adequate reason for the shift in legal position was cited by the general accounting office and the justice department in the explanation that accompanied the rule change i asked the congressional research service to take a look at the issue of the legality of contracting our for debt collection services crs found no clear legal explanation for the change in the opinion of the general accounting office and the justice department it seems to me that if an activity was once considered to violate federal law then it takes a legislative change in order to make that activity legal neither the comptroller general nor the attorney general has the authority to amend federal statutes because of the tremendous uncertainty engendered by the change to the federal claims collection act regulations we need to clarify the law no agency can responsibly rely on the newly revised rule i am concern ed that any action based on this questionable interpretation will lead to significant disruption of agency debt collection efforts it will raise questions of possible liability for aget icies and agency personnel for impriper disclosure of information without legislation action massive confusion will result the text of the bill follows h r 4333 a bill to amend the

there are many members here today who would like to support this bill and argue that this is really a jobs bill and that with passage we would save many thousands of jobs that is an appealing argument one which deserves close scrutiny the points congresswoman oakar is making are valid considerations it is true that our economy is depressed right nowwe are all painfully aware of that every dollar lost to foreign imports hurts right now we have too many americans out of work it is true that one of our industries hardest hit by the recession by high interest rates and by vigorous foreign competition has been the auto industy it might even be true that this bill would supply some relief for auto manufacturers but it is not true that this bill would help our nation or our economy as a whole on the other side of the coin is the terribly adverse effect that this bill would have on our foreign trade and on many sectors of our economy outside of auto making if we pass this legislation we will be inviting the other nations of the world to retaliate against our exports at the very time when we are negotiating with our foreign trading partners to open up their markets to more american procucts we would in one great sweep wipe away all our progress to date providing other nations with incentive to impose harsh tariffs and harsh quotas on amercian goods thus hurting those american industries that are strong overseas and crippling those already hurting there are several likely targets american agriculture which accounts for 42 percent of our exports the american electronics and aerospace industry where we have gambled on our future and american serviceoriented industries such as banking and insurance the bottom line is that the benefits of this legislation to the domestic auto industry can not match the tremendous costs of this legislation to other sectors of the economy in the end this legislation might very well cost us net jobs exacerbating rather than easing the unemployment problem we can best help our ailing auto industry by putting our own economic house in orderreducing the deficit and interest rates and encouraging a strong wellgrounded domestic recovery

remarks i oppose the amendment president reagans proposal for massive increases in military spending over the next 5 years threatens the security of the entire world if approved by congress these proposals would destabilize our economy erode our defense alliances and accelerate the arms race the presidents defense budget is founded on the unrealistic assumption that an ever more powerful preemptive military force is the key to p secure defense this policy can only lead us toward war i believe that national security and world peace depend on economic strength nuclear disarmament and conventional arms limitations and cooperative international defense agreements the presidents program would undermine these objectives and thus threaten our real national security our nations armed forces must be fully equipped welltrained and thoroughly prepared and i would support a defense budget which would insure this but the presidents proposal greatly exceeds what is needed to maintain such a force he suggests funding for unreasonably expensive nuclear weapons programs such as the mx missile program for unreliable and unproven equipment such as the xm1 tank and for nuclear weapons that would increase the potential for a nuclear conflict such as the pershing and cruise ii missiles the presidents defense budget wastes badly needed federal revenue on a dangerous policy of military buildup the president hopes to more than double military expenditures from 173 9 billion in 1981 to 374 3 billion in 1986 a jump in defense allotments from 24 7 to 37 6 percent of the total federal budget in fiscal 1982 alone he plans a 15percent increase over 1981 to an estimated total obligational authority of 222 2 billion defense spending will be significantly higher still according to the congressional budget office which found the presidents inflation estimates for the 4 outyears to be low cbo determined that defense will cost 6 4 billion more in fiscal year 1982 that the president projects for 1986 defense spending would shoot up to at least 50 billion above the figure the president projects ceo estimates these unanticipated costs would have to be absorbed by the pentagon forcing cuts in programs the presidents proposals clearly exhibit poor economic planning increased dependence on the military budget will force inflation up rapidly and make it vitually impossible for our civilian economy to recover this impact will couple with the presidents proposed tax cuts to worsen our current economic instability i want to remind my colleagues that a similar policy of steeply increased military outlays together with unwillingness to raise tax rates during the vietnam war is primarily responsible for our current runaway inflation abroad the administration is urging out allies to adopt similar policies of expanded military might the presidents stated intention to embark on massive military stockpiling as well as the state departments growing pressure on allies to undertake simultaneous buildups already is beginning to strain unitedstates relations with several nations this policy is raising the risks involved in all international conflicts which might develop no matter how small the damage to our civilian economy which the presidents proposals would do poses a serious threat to national security by weakening the nations fiscal and economic role in the world under his plan we would be caught in a whirlpool of military spending that would drain our economy of its ability to provide social fiscal and military security if we are to be successful at bringing about an economic recovery we must reprogram some of these increases in defense spending toward human services an other civilian activities in the reagan military budget 75 percent of the planned defense increases above president carters proposals for 1982 are targeted for procurement of new weapons systems this would mean that a total of 68 5 billion will be committed to procurement contracts in fiscal year 1982 but much of that money will not actually be spent until 1984 or later when those contracts take effect this largescale lockup of funds will cause a sudden inflation jump by limiting available funds without producing consumable commodities a strong domestic economy cannot be achieved until the economy is made substantially less reliant on military expenditures military spending is a relatively poor stimulus for creating jobs and adds to inflation rather than helping to control it one billion dollars spent on mass transportation would create approximately 26 000 more jobs than the same amount spent on the mx missile system according to the council on economic priorities about the same advantage exists for money spent to create teaching jobs as compared to using it to generate military production this xegative effect of military outlays is worsened by the fact that many of the jobs generated by milltary spending are shortterm temporary positions that actually interfere with longterm resolution of our current employment problems the demands which largescale milltary spending put on competition for scarce resources such as highly skilled technicians and engineers and its upward impact on inflation will prevent the civilian sector from obtaining the resources it sorely needs for growth an artificial competitive advantage is created for militaryrelated industries in obtaining scarce resources by the dominant role pentagon expenditures play in our economy yet a disproportionately small quantity of commodities returns to our civilian economy military increases come at the cost of vital federal programs that serve basic human needs programs that feed people for example will be cut by almost 5 billion and funds for public service employment would be eliminated to save 4 8 billion the inequity of these budget priorities cannot be overlooked macroeconomic studies support the examnples i have given of how the presidents military budget proposals would undermine efforts to improve the economy the world bank and the unitedstates arms control agency for example compiled data which showed that steppedup military spending tends to weaken national economies the study compared the percent of gnp used for military purposes to the growth in manufacturing productivity in seven industrialized nations for the years 196077 those nations which used relatively large portions of their gnp for defense such as the united states generally had lowgrowth rates japan for example gave the lowest gnp percentage to defense ninetenths of 1 percent and had by far the highest annual growth rate 8 8 percent at the other end of the scale the united states put 7 6 percent of its gnp toward defense and had the second lowest growth rate at only 3 4 percent annually i believe the united states faces continued severe economic stagnation as a result of growing military spending historically the policy of the united states has been to develop cooperative defense strategies with ita allies to insure international and domestic security we currently are involved in some 29 formal agreements the nato alliance most prominent among them the nato alliance provides the democratic world with a significant margin of international security both in number of strategic weapons and in strategic planning capability nato countries outspent warsaw pact nations during the 1970s by 207 billion on military goods and possess 3 200 more strategic nuclear weapons a renewed commitment to natoprovided security by the united states and our european allies would create a cheaper and less dangerous world situation than would a unitedstates initiated worldwide arms buildup arms control measures and disarmanent agreements offer an important longterm approach to mutual security and international peace the salt 11 process brought us close to a reasonable check against further nuclear expansion this agreement should be ratified it is a necessary step toward disarmament although salt ii itself falls far short of real disarmament negotiations for reductions in european theater nuclear forces merit strong unitedstates support west german chancellor helmut schmidt recently proposed a freeze on the deployment of our europeanbased pershing 11 and cruise missiles pending negotiations for mutual reductions among nato and warsaw pact nations these missiles clearly increase the risk of a nuclear attack on europe both soviet and unitedstates officials already have give attention to a comprehensive test ban for nuclear weapons that would open a direct avenue to a nuclear weapons freeze negotiations on such a ban should be continued substantial reductions can be made in the presidents proposals for the military budget in five areas without weakening unitedstates defense funding for programs that increase our nuclear weapons stockpile those which simply generate repetitive weaponry weapons which the administration plans to produce even though testing on them is either incomplete or indicates significant problems the tremendously expensive mx missile system and generally the elimination of widespread waste in defense programs production of the trident submarine americas most expensive nuclear weapon in production at a projected 1982 cost of 1 6 billion is one of the unnecessary weapons in the presidents budget the tomahawk cruise maissile which threatens to undermine future arms control measures could be eliminated at a savings of 391 million for fiscal 1982 as well the european theater nuclear forces which i mentioned earlier are budgeted for 932 million for 1982 these missile systems would create a substantial offensive nuclear threat to the soviet union and further polarize the alreadytense european situation antiballistic missiles which would violate slt 1 could be eliminated and thus save 438 million without reducing unitedstates security there are several cases of repetitive weaponry in the current military budget these include the cx airlift planes which the administration plans to begin development of at~ a cost of 250 million for fiscal year 1982 even though the similar c5 transport is not yet fully operational due to production and operating problems f14 and f15 fighter planes which last year received a higher authorization from congress than the pentagon requested are scheduled to receive an additional 2 4 billion but these planes would provide no significant new cappbilities the extremely costly and controversial xm1 battle tank is prematurely budgeted for production at 2 billion in the reagan 1982 budget the reliability and durability of the xm1 was called into serious question both by a department of defense appointed panel of technical experts and by a gao study both investigations expressed doubt that the tank was ready for production the mx missile system is probably the greatest boondoggle of the military budget estimated for fiscal 1982 at 2 9 billion this controversial weapons system is likely to coast more than 100 billion before it is finished possibly as soon as 1986 military experts many citizens and several members of congress have questioned the feasibility and advisability of the proposed landbasing mode for the mx and no alternatives have yet been seriously explored yet the president is actively pursuing deployment of the mx of equally great concern is the direct threat the mx would create to soviet security forcing escalation of the arms race undermining arms limitation talks and substantially increasing world tensions if the president were truly interested in eliminating waste from the oovernmient no department deserves closer scrutiny than the defense department omb director david stockman recently told a congressional committee that pentagon waste was widespread but the administration has thus far avoidcd making cuts there several investigations documented waste in the pentagon in eight major areas one recent investigation of pentagon waste found that a minimum estimate of the cost of military waste is put at 15 billion a year the sources of waste are in many areas of the military and the problem clearly is pervasive needless purchases of goods already in stock performance of unnecessary operations and poor supervision contribute several billion dollars of waste of materials equipment and fuel one

to allow for an anticipated expansion of the fiscal year 1982 and fiscal year 1983 programs it has also approved an additional 112 million for family housing to improve the quality of life for our

which may determine whether we continue on our present course or whether we begin to move toward resumption of negotiations on freezing and reducing strategic arms we have heard a lot in recent weeks about the impracticality of a nuclear freeze as one method to minimize the peril of a nuclear exchange critics charge that a freeze will allow the soviets to retain their nuclear advantage and that a freeze is not verifiable they add that agreeing to a freeze provides a disincentive for the soviets to negotiate a true reduction in armaments and they raise doubts about whether or not the soviets would even agree to a freeze each of these arguments are easily refutable quite simply critics of the arms freeze fail to recognize that the soviets do not hold any clear advantage over the united states in nuclear arms and in fact current forces on both sides are in better balance now than at any other time in history they also ignore the fact that the most important aspects of the freeze testing and deployment can be verified and that our intelligence capabilities now permit us to monitor even the production of new soviet weapons it is also important to point out that in 1977 1978 and 1979 soviet officials proposed their own halt to the nuclear arms race along the same lines as the freeze at the very least we can surmise that even if the united states proposed a freeze the soviet union would give it very serious consideration despite these and other arguments for supporting a nuclear freeze it is likely that the rebuttal on its merits will go on for as long as its critics permit the discerners will continue to ascertain as best they can whether the present course of human events carries with it the danger of devastating life in our world they will continue seemingly unemoumbered by the weighty responsibility they hold to point meticuously to every imagined imperfection and flaw and simply by virtue of their concern over how the soviets behave in a real world and over this countrys perceived security needs prolong the status quo and heighten even further the dangers of a nuclear conflict truly the main obstacle to a negotiated freeze will be this kind of skepticism about whether a freeze is worth seeking in the meantime while we build more weapons the soviet union will be doing the same both countries are about to embark on a new generation of nuclear weapons that are so accurate that they will be able to eliminate the weapons of other nations before they are even launched in addition while the adminstration pledges to increase its strategic weapon stockpile at an alarming rate neither the united states nor the soviet union have demonstrated a commitment to open dialog with each other on the issue of armament control in response our citizens grow nervous and even more importantly fearful and with good reason we live unfortunately in a world of threats and counter threats of force and counterforce and as technolbgical advances make new weapons more usable the temptation to use them will be greater than before inevitably there will come the moment of a crisis when one nation will decide to push the button before the other does aggression will be met with aggression retaliation with retaliation and humanity as we know it will fall by the wayside every american knows that this scenario is possible we must begin now therefore to focus attention on the urgent need for more rapid progress toward reductions in nuclear armaments bearing in mind that the freeze is not an end in itself and that it should be followed by major mutual and verifiable reductions so let us begin tonight as we attempt to chart the best course to increased national security to reverse the nuclear arms race by first calling it to a halt thank you

construction of flood protection along the upper cumberland river and i would like to commend the gentlemen from mississippi massachusetts alabama and indiana for their effective efforts in bringing this bill through conference the upper cumberland provision is of vital importance both to the physical safety of entire communities in my district as well as to my districts economic development i would like to describe the flooding problems we have faced and why it is that the provisions in this bill are so important southeastern kentucky has been plagued by severe flooding from time immemorial we have steep mountains which cause rapid runoffs these runoffs are made especially treacherous by the fact that we have very narrow valleys valleys which constrict the flow of the water and we have next to no warning of these floods since the mountains prevent the accurate forecasting and warning systems which are possible in other parts of the country and the hazards of this flooding are greatly magnified by the fact that many families live right along the river banks with the severe lack of level land most families and business es have no choice but to build along the rivers and this places them right in the track of the rushing waters in 1977 all of these threats and all of these geologic and hydrologic factors turned into cold reality with the worst flood on record along many por tions of the upper cumberland tug fork and levisa rivers barbourville ky was the scene of heroism which is rare in this day and age despite the rapidly rising waters and despite the personal danger they faced many couragious citizens stayed behind to pile sandbags on top of the levees their heroic efforts succeeded in keeping the torrential waters from flooding through the streets of barbourville pineville ky was not so fortunate all the protection they had simply was not good enough as the townspeople looked on the waters came rushing over the floodwalls into the town into their homes and into their businesses over the next tense hours volunteers rescued stranded men and women including many senior citizens from rooftops and car tops families found shelter in the local hospital and in the coming days and weeks they returned to their homes and businesses to start the backbreaking work of cleaning up the sediment which averaged about half a foot deep and which covered most of the town the damage was staggering immediate estimates were at least 27 million in damages nine hundred homes were destroyed or severely damaged property owners were forced into longterm debtdebt which continues to burden these communities property values plummeted and tax bases were de pleted and perhaps worst of all the flood added yet another burden to the backs of these communities which are trying so hard to help themselves in an area which has long suffered from chronic underdevelopment they have been striving to attract more businesses and jobs to the area this newest flood dashed many of those hopes in view of this record documenting the clearcut need for flood protection along the upper cumberland the congress specifically appropriated funds for the construction of flood protection but despite the black and white instructions in the law we have faced roadblock after roadblock in the construction of our flood protection first bureaucratic delays prevented any construction during fiscal year 1982despite the fact that funds had been appropriated specifically for that purpose and second the corps decided not to build the normal standard project flood protection protection to cover the worst flood that could reasonably be expected in an area but to build protection only just high enough to cover a flood of the magnitude of the flood of 1977 these proposals were altogether unacceptable and i am delighted that language has been included in the bill to correct them first the bill requires the fiscal year 1982 funds included in the energy and water appropriations act for fiscal year 1982 to be obligated still during this fiscal year i wholeheartedly applaud this clear unequivocable and unmistakeable instruction requiring the corps to proceed with construction without any further delay if we are going to build flood protection let us get on and build it every indication is that flooding is going to continueand will probably occur even more frequently in years to come and when those flood waters come rushing down the mountains and are ebbing toward the top of the floodwalls the men and women in my district are going to need more than studles more than promises and more than good will to save themthey are going to need fullfledged flood protebtion and nothing less will do them any good a second important provision in this bill requires the corps to construct the flood protection at the standard project flood level this is exactly the blunt message we have needed to set the record straight it is the intention of the congress to give the communities along the upper cumberland river full and complete flood protection and protection just to the flood of 1977 level is simply not good enough as the corps has stated in its own documents flooding in this region is sure to continueand it may even worsen as the region is developed while i respect the need to reduce federal spending any marginal savings in this case would be more than wiped out by even one major overtopping flood and where human health and life is concerned as is the case here there can be no excuse for pinching pennies in addition protection to the level of the flood of 1977 is absolutely inadequate to allow the economic develop ment of this area it would not free local communities from the flood insurance requirements it would prevent these communities from ever building on their few acres of level land most of which are located along the river banks thereby condemning them to continued economic stagnation and it would deny these communities any opportunity to attract businesses to the area a step which is essential if these communities are ever to help themselves the provisions in this bill give my district the life lease it desperately needs it will give us a foundation for the economic development of this whole region along the upper cumberland it will give hundreds of families the assurance that they can sleep without fear even when they hear a forecast for rain if a man were standing beneath a rushing tidal wave we would not suggest a study of his plight if a man were drowning we would not saw his lifeboat in half but this has been exactly the plight of these communities in my district when each day they wondered what new roadblock had been placed ahead of their flood protection the provisions in this bill give us the relief we need i commend my distinguished colleagues from alabama and indiana for their efforts in working with the other body to secure this effective and badly needed provision and i urge the

zens to worry about a war that probhave to begin with president reagans ably will not come to worry about a commitment under president carter battle that may not happen in constant 1982 dollars we6 had pro let me suggest first of all that the posed to spend 172 9 billion in 1980 in actual processes of defeat is itself inobllgationeil authority that had wartime everything no matter how grown to 186 billion in 1981 and to good your intellectual arguments no 196 billion in 1982 matter how good your bureaucracies under president reagan however no matter how eloquent your statewe dramatically increased from 172 6 ments to armed services committees billion in 1980 to 193 9 billion in 1981 if you cannot win on the battlefield to a proposed 222 2 billion in 1982 to nothing else matters 238 4 1billion in 1983 anid so on it is it was said best by winston churthe largest increase in defense spend chill who warned us in the gather ing in peacetime since the late thirties ing storm quoting from a speech he why did president reaganbelieve had made in 1934 that wars come we need that increase because the quickly that you cannot be certain president and his advisers believe that when they wfi happen that one day the world is dangerous because they suddenly an ambaisador comes he de believe that the soviet military build livers a message and the following day up is a threat your countries are at war the battlefield is more than just this front or that front this division or that division the battlefield is the heart and mind of the nation the strategy the general conditions in which the political leadership makes decisions harry summers in an excellent book on vietnam entitled on strategythe vietnam war in context colonel summers currently an active officer in the army teaching at the carlisle war college begins his book with a quote you know you never defeated us on the battlefield said the american colonel the north vietnamese colonel pondered this remark a moment and said that may be so but it is also irrelevant conversation in hanoi april i1075 the north vietnamese won that war on the battlefield of our minds on the battlefield of our budgets on the battlefield of our foreign policy even if they never won that war on the battlefield around saigon so long as ameri can troops were present currently we face a crisis because we are losing a war on the battlefield of the pentagon just as surely as we are losing a war potentially on the battlefields of europe or the middle east president reagan attempted to shift the quantitative side of defense spending he attempted to increase dramatically our commitment to a sound defense secretary weinberger has done i think an excellent job at the strategic level of forcing the military bureaucracies to think again and again about the mx mobile basing system und ar secretary carlucci has done a superb job of forcing fundamental thinking about procurement policy within the context of the pentagon in some recent votes on authorization bills we have changed some of the laws to allow thepentagon to spend more wisely but on balance the reagan administration has not done the job it needs to and as a consequence we are today at the beginning of our first retreat from what was a brief 6month surge of defense spending 1 there are three reasons we are retreating first the russians have not invaded poland the world seems less dangerous and shooting down twolibyan jets felt good it gave the american people the sense that we showed them second the wave of spending c uts on the civilian side has not been matched by equal toughness in defense spending there is not a sense thatwe are as willing to grill the generalsaswe are to grill the civilian bureaucracies while i praise secretary weinberger and under secretary carlucci for thei r initiatives i have to fault them for their lack of flair their lack of publicity to too great an extent cap the knife is in danger of becoming cap thie advocate and should that happen i fear he will lose his effectiveness in convincing the american people that we will question amilitary bureaucracy as tightly as a civilian bureaucracy the third and deeper reason that the reagan administration is steadily losing ground in the congress and i think ultimately in the news media in the country on the issue of defense spending is because the dry rot of the pentagon bureaucracy remains unchallenged you can take every quote by president reagan about bureaucracy in general every quote about its waste its silliness its lack of direction and you can apply them to the pentagon the reality is that the pentagon is the largest most sophisticated bureaucracy in this city that for last 38 years they have systematically and steadily developed an ability to do less and less while spending more and more with greater and greater complexity here are some recent examples the desert one tragedy in iran led to no firings no resignations no courts of inquiry when the british in the 18th century lost majorca they executed the admiral who failed in this country on all too many occasions in recent years we have promoted the senior of cer who failed on cost overruns to the best of my knowledge there have been no major firings of the military leaders directly involved in spending large chunks of money in effect whatever happens on the battlefield or in the building project the game goes on in many cases the officer who had the overrun ends up working for the company he had the overrun with simply throwing more money at obsolete ideas and absurd structure does not solve anything in the long run it may in fact weaken things both by crippling those of us who favor a strong defense and also by leading some people to believe we are actually beig saved while all we are being is wasteful the challenge i would raise is much deeper than anything we have seen this year if the administration thinks the defense threat the danger of war is important enough to spend this amount of money on then it ought to be willing to fundamentally reform the pentagon bureaucracy we need elihu root not henri maginot as secretary of defense we need a willingness to fundamentally restructure things for those who remain faithful to the vision of military bureaucratic compei tence let me suggest the following facts should at least lead them to question their faith first i have asked this of every officer i have seen recently there is no major war we can win with the soviets period let me repeat that there is no major war we can win against the soviets period second we nowfocus on buying high technology in a narrow formula that prevents us from using the high technology we spend so much money on for example we buy the f15 h 61 19 fighter aircraft a superb aircraft clearly one of the two finest airsuperiority fighters in the world the other being the f14 we buy it with enormously complex and expensive elec tronic gear so it can fight in what is called a forceonforce conflict that is with many aircraft in the air at one time yet in testimony before the senate appropriations committee on the department of defense appropriations for 1981 general russ said about the third level which is force on forcei so i would say that 95 percent of our people are at level 1 maybe 50 are at level 2 and a few are at level 3 what that means is that you are buying extraordinarily expensive aircraft which you are not flying the pilots in long enough to use the aircraft at its current capability so that 50 percent of your pilots are using the plane as though it were a dramatically cheaper oneonone fighter plane another 40 percent or so are using the aircraft as though it is a slightly superior oneontwo or oneonthree airplane and probably 10 percent of your fighter pilots are sufficiently qualified to use the airplane for the purpose you paid for it is like using a cadillac as a dump truck and it is done because the air force is focused on procuring hardware rather than on building a balanced force that has enough money tonfy the airplane to train the pilots to buy the munitions and to maintain the entire system we have to develop a total equation of research and development procurement maintenance training in order to measure full systems against each other third we are buying an allhightechnology force in a way that is historically absurd the reality is that high technology limits size and a 4 lord nelson warne4 us numbers annihilate it is important to remember that when the german army invaded russia in 1941 there were only 24 armored divisions the rest of that army was infantry with horsedrawn logistics the israelis in 1973 were still using world war ii supersherman tanks when necessary we simply cannot buy enough f15s f16s and a10s to equip all of our regular forces and all of our reserves but the professional military bureaucracys answer is to blame the politicians and the people that is candidly a copout wellington had to fight the peninsular war with the army he had not the army he dreamed of midway was won in what walter lord called an incredible victory with the navy available not the navy admiral spruance wanted the current military bureaucracy buys what it wants and shrugs off the gaps in procurement and training as someone elses fault that is simply fundamentally professionally wrong it is like buying a new car and having h 6150 go no money to buy gas to drive it home the syrians in the golan heights in 1973 lost over 100 tanks simply because they ran out of gasoline the japanese suffered extremely high aircraft losses in the mariana turkey shoot of 1944 because they could not train the pilots the first operational jet fighter of germany the me 262 could not achieve its peak effectiveness because of the lack of aviation fuel in germany in 1944 and 1945 the american military bureaucracy is actually planning in the purchasing patterns we see to create the probable fiascos of the future for our own military to spend the money in such a manner that you cannot finish the entire process that fancy weapons systems exist that cannot be used is simply irresponsible example we have a long war structure for the army that is capable not of fighting a short war but fighting only a skirmish literally incapable of fighting even a war the length of yom kippur"],

to open new markets and create new jobs the sons and daughters of the new deal have struggled to insure that their fanilies and communities are strong and that those who have not shared fully in our bounty are protected yet for the past 20 years we as a government have not allowed our citizens living and working abroad to pursue fully the american ideal of free competition the main fault lies in our policy of taxing overseas unitedstates citizens we are the only industrialized nation in the free world which taxes its citizens living in other countries companies have found it uneconomical to hire americans overseas since h 4490 co japanese germans englishmen or other nationals do not have to pay taxes to their home country this has led to a massive exodus of americans from the international economic and ideological marketplace and resulted in reduced exports loss of jobs at home and loss of influence abroad america has been able to achieve its present high standard of living because our government has traditionally encouraged domestic and international trade as a member and past chairman of the house export task force i am convinced that our policy of taxing americans overseas has severely hampered our rnbillty to compete the gao the georgetown center for strategic and international studies the presidents export council chase econometrics the unitedstates trade representative the commerce department and many others have joined me in this assessment the american entrepreneur abroad does more to build respect and admiration for the free enterprise system than all the tanks and airplanes we could ever deploy the thoughtful and dedicated overseas american does more to bring about a better understanding of our political ideals and institutions than all the information services we might attempt to use as a substitute the economic development of the rest of the world and the creation of markets for american products are fostered more by dedicated unitedstates entrepreneurs than by all of our bilateral and multilateral assistance programs combined it is time for us to adopt the standard used by the rest of the world in taxing its overseas citizens that isthe residence principle which requires the individual to pay taxes where he lives according to chase econometrics this policy would result in a net revenue gain to the treasury of over 5 billion a year through creation of new exportrelated jobs at home perhaps more important this would also encourage americans to live overseas and transmit our concept of freedom and worth of the individual to other societies adoption of the residence tax principle is truly in our national interest and will contribute greatly to our national securityat no 2axpense to the american taxpayer i therefore urge this house to support proposal such as h r 4016 which would apply the residence principle to income earned overseas i hope that this policy will soon be extended to all americans living

complex but its purposes are simple to reform outmoded and unworkable provisions of the present immigration law and to gain control of our national borders this is an historic occasion not only because of the significance of the bill itself but also because an identical bill is being introduced in the senate by senator alan k simpson of wyoming chairman of the senate subcommittee on immigration and refugee policy it is rare when a house and a senate subcommittee chairman agree to introduce an identical bill it is extraordinary when the chairmen are introducing such an identical bill on one of the most controversial subjects of our times it is even more extraordinary when the chairmen are from different parties and different regions of the country we have reached this point for two reasons first the issue of immigration is so important to our nation and the need to reform our laws is so pressing that all party and regional loyalties as well as differenaces must be transcended as elected representatives we must reflect the interests and concerns of those who elected us but we cannot also forget that on certain fundamental issuesnational defense foreign policy crime drug abuse and now immigrationthe importance of the subject requires a totally objective nonparochial approach the second reason we have come to this point in immigration reform is alan simpson he is an unusual man and an unusual senator he and his very capable staff have been a joy and a pleasure to work with during the past 13 months as we have studied this issue together before assuming the chairmanship last year as you all know senator simpson served as one of the members of the select commission on immigra tion and refugee policy chaired by my good friend father theodore m hesburgh president of notre dame my alma mater since becoming chairman of the senate subcommittee he has been extremely helpful to me and my staff and has been thoroughly cooperative as we have worked on this issue for the first time in 30 years our two subcommittees held joint hearings on the subject of immigration reform we have traveled together to study immigration problems most recently earlier this month to the state of florida we have traveled what i have termed the equivalent of the borscht circuit of immigration putting on our immigration today show at conferences such as one at williamsburg sponsored by the rockefeller and ford foundations and the conference at san diego sponsored by the san diego city club for these last few weeks we have had extensive detailed meetings on all aspects of the bill we are introducing today with a true dialog so that today we have a joint venture of which we are both proud what we are introducing today is a fair and equitable and workable and balanced bill neither of us is happy with each and every one of its provisions but we believe that as a whole it is the type of package that people who study this issue carefully will agree is the best approach to that most nettlesome of moral social economic and political of issuesimmigration senator simpson and i have traveled a long road to reach this point both of us have given exhaustive study to this issue right now i want to pay tribute to the six other members of my subcommitteesam hall of texas pat schroeder of colorado barney frank of massachusetts ham fish of new york dan lungren of california and bill mccollum of floridawho have participated in endless hours of hearings and meetings and acquired a firm understanding of this matter without them the product we have before us today would not have been possible i wish also to thank my professionally competent and personally devoted subcommittee staffharris miller skip endres peter regis gene pugliese and bonnie mcguirefor their fine help also i want to thank chairman peter w rodino jr of the full committee ranking minority member congressman robert mcclory and committee staff director garner cline for their consistent support let me review briefly what has transpired leading to the development of this legislation first the most recent three administrations have proposed major immigration reform presidents ford and carter and now president reagan have recognized the importance of immigration and all three proposed strikingly similar packages to deal with it all elements of earlier formulations are in the bill i am introducing the attorneys general who served under the three presidents i citedespecially our present attorney general william french smithdeserve spe cial commendation for their interest in immigration frankly as i told attorney general smith when he came before our subcommittee when they were wooing you to leave sunny california to come to washington i doubt that anybody bothered to advise you that the nettlesome immigration question would ue sitting there in the middle of your desk as the first of your many hot potatoes but to the attorney generals credit he has plunged into this issue with full dedication i hope he and the president will give their full and influential support to the bill senator simpson and i have drafted another element which helped produce our bill on immigration reform was the select commission on immigration and refugee policy which was established 4 years ago by congress and which just 1 year ago issued the most comprehensive report and set of recommendations on immigration since 1911 that commission was chaired by father hesburgh as i noted one of the most talented individuals of our age having chaired my own subcommittee in the study of this multifaceted issue for the past year i appreciate even more the talent of father hesburgh who was able to bring together so many diverse points of viewfrom eight members of congress four members of the previous administration and four public membersinto one comprehensive set of recommendations the work of that select commission has been invaluable to senator simpson and me in putting together our bill just as i believe that presidents ford carter and reagan will see a lot of what they recommended in our bill so do i believe that father hesburgh and the other commissioners will see a lot of their dedicated work reflected in our measure since becoming chairman of the house subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law last february i have spent more time on the immigration issue than on any other policy issue since my arrival in the house over 11 years ago my subcommittee held 12 days of extensive hearings on all aspects of immigration reform including as i noted earlier 4 days of joint hearings with senator simpsons subcommittee we have heard from witnesses from all walks of life we have heard the pros and cons articulated on every element of this bill even one who had never heard anything about immigration reform but took the time to read our hearings would quickly become a reigning expert on the issue senator simpson and i have not only learned from our hearings directed specifically to immigration reform but also from more generalized hearings on the operations of the immigration and naturalization service on the consular operations of the department of state on our refugee program and on other related immigration problems several of the problems dealt with in my bill were on private immigration bills highlighted in hearings i have conducted my subcommittee members and i have taken several major subcommittee investigative trips to places such as southern california florida mexico city southeast asia and europe reports of these trips have been published so others could obtain a more personal fceling for the issues before us finally we have had many private meetings with individurls concerned about immigration who have brought us information and insights which have proven invaluable in sum i do not think that anybody can say that we have not done our best to learn and understand i believe our bill reflects that the details of the bill senator simpson and i have prepared follow my remarks also to follow is a copy of a letter i addressed to the attorney general today dealing with the detention of haitians at the krome facility in miami suffice it now to say that i believe this bill to be fair balanced workable and equitable it should be enacted into law"], [0.000745236873626709, 0.5007452368736267, 1, "i rise to oppose the frank amendment to the food and agriculture act of 1981 h r 3603 this amendment which is based on the reagan administrations proposal would lower the parity floor on dairy price supports from 75 to 70 percent of parity it would give the secretary of agriculture authority to allow the parity level to drop below 70 percent when government expenditures exceed 750 million finally it would eliminate the semiannual adjustment in the support price while retaining the current dollar level of the support price at 13 10 per hundredweight proponents of this measure argue that price supports must be held down in order to reduce dairy surpluses and cut government spending the president feels that it is fair to ask dairy farmersto make this sacrifice for the sake of the national economy furthermore he and agriculture secretary block claim their proposal preserves an adequate price support program for dairy producers i disagree with the president and his supporters on every point their proposal will not result in an adequate program on the contrary it will drive many farm families out of business their proposal is not the only nor it is the best way to reduce dairy surpluses the administration has badly mismanaged dairy exports has failed to actresponsibly on limiting imports and has cut back on important domestic nutrition programs which utilize milk and milk products finally the amendment is unfair after having provided huge tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in this country how can this administration and this congress blame farm families for rising budget def icits before addressing each of these points in more detail i would like to review some of the history behind this issue four years ago the congress placed a temporary 80 percent of parity floor on milk price supports this relatively highparity floor was enacted to return stability to the dairy market previous lower support levels had resulted in extreme fluctuations in supply and price which hurt both producers and consumers the 80percent floor along with the semiannual adjustment of the support price worked remarkably well during the first 2 years the support price was generally even with or below the market price and the program acquired a relatively small quantity of dairy productsjust slightly above that required for domestic and foreign nutrition programs in 1979 congress reaffirmed the 80percent floor then a severe recession overtook farming in 1980 net farm income dropped 25 percent and this year is expected to rise only to 1979 levels return on investment for farmers in 1980 averaged 2 4 percent this problem was compounded by the restrictions placed on grain exports to the soviet union which helped keep grain prices low dairy farmers did have an adequate pricesupport program this had the unfortunate consequence however of encouraging farmers to switch their resources from other commodities to milk production and encouraging dairy farmers to expand their herds against this background it is not difficult to understand how we arrived at our current situation of course we have a surplus of dairy products when milk is virtually the only major commodity that yields farmers even a marginal profit we can expect farmers to produce a lot of milk unfortunately the administrations solution is to eliminate the profit in dairy farming rather than looking for ways to make other commodities more profitable however it is not accurate to portray dairy farmers as growing rich at the expense of consumers and taxpayers i represent one of the largest dairy districts in the country and i know that this is simply not the case again if we look at recent history we find that dairy farmers work long hours for low wages and their income has not kept pace with increases in the costs of production we also find that dairy products are among the best values available to todays consumers dairy farmers must make huge investments in land buildings equipment and livestock they must be on the job every day of the year their days are long and their work requires much knowledge and skill what do they earn for this effort in 1980 with price supports at 80 percent of parity dairy farmer income averaged 2 89 per hour according to university of wisconsin researchers that is 15 percent below the minimum wage unfortunately that 2 89 will look awfully good if this amendment passes farmers already gave up last aprils adjustment of the support price and it has fallen from 80 t~o 72 percent of parity now the gentleman from massachusetts offers the white house amendment which will give the secretary authority to hold the support price steady for the foreseeable futureat least the next fewv years some argue that because the dollar level of price supports cannot go below 13 10 we are not really cutting price supports this is true if production costs remain constant but as every farmer and businessman knows that day is far off last year dairy production costs rose 10 3 rcent meanwhile the prices received by farmers rose only 7 1 percent undcr this amendment those prices would hardly rise at all for consumers duiry prices have not increased as rapidly as other prices from march 1980 to march 1981 general consumer prices rose 10 6 percent while dairy prices rose only 10 1 percent and as i said the prices received by farmers rose only about 7 1 percent of greater significance is the fact that milk prices have declined in relation to the general wage rate the minutes of work required to purchase a gallon of milk have declined 44 percent over the past three decades the period during which price supports have been kept a 75 percent of parity or more so we can see that the american dairy farmer is not getting rich at the expense of the taxpayer and consumer on the contrary with limited government help he has kept his head above water by working long hours and improving productivity as i stated earlier the points raised in support of the gentlemans amendment are open to question for example the administration and the gentleman from massachusetts claim they are proposing an adequate program i disagree this amendment will cost dairy farmers over 1 billion annually when compared to the 75percent floor proposed by the house agriculture committee make no mistake about it we will be driving family farms out of business with this amendment large operators may be able to weather these losses but a great many small family farms will not the administration tells us this is the only way to lower dairy surpluses meanwhile the white house has stalled on imposing import controls on casein which displaced 333 million pounds of domestic nonfat dry milk in 1980 the administration has also cut important domestic nutrition programs which utilize dairy products and most disturbing is the fact the the president has given a foreign country new zealand veto power over further sales of government butter stocks overseas in each instance the administration has rejected other options for disposing of our surpluses finally there is a question of equity i certainly agree that the 1 886 billion the commodity credit corporation will spend this year on the dairy program is a lot of money but so is the 6 billion in tax breaks this congress gave to those earning over 100 000 in 1982 the same could be said for the 12 billion tax breaks given to the oil industry and the 25 billion given to big business by fiscal mr chairmar we must balance the budget but why are we putting farm families out of business re the same wve are giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our society the american dairy farmers had already accepteid a cut in price supports from 80 to 75 percent of parity the gentlemans amendment will for all practical purposes eliminate the parity floor on the support price i hope that my colleagues will reject the amendment and give the family farm

title iii of the bill is a result of a schedule slip in the space shuttle program in 1978 the congress directed the navy to lease future communications satellite service rather than continuing to build its own fleet satellite communications fijtsatcom system which was about to enter service in response to that direction the navy awarded a competitively negotiated contract to obtain satellite communication service to the fleet on a lease basis as a followon to the fltsatcom program under the terms of that contract the contractor is responsible for construction and launch of satellites that would satisfy navy requirements after successful launch and deployment the navy would then purchase the communication services provided by the satellites on entering into the leased satellite or leasat contract it was understood that the space shuttle would be available as a launch vehicle in early 1982 and the contractor designed leasat for shuttle launch only based on the shuttle schedule that was in existence in 1978 since that time the shuttle has incurred an extensive delay and the first leasat launch is now scheduled for may 1984vice april 1982 as originally planned this has caused a significant change in the contractor financing arrangement the contractor has stopped production efforts on the leasat and has placed the program in a caretaker status lengthy discussions and negotiations between the secretary of the navy and the contractor have led to a tentative agreement for modification to the existing contract to implement revised terms if a mutually agreed shuttle schedule and service requirements for satellite communications can be reached by november 1 1981 contract modifications being considered include a redistribution of payments to accommodate financing requirements but with no increase in total program cost additionally the navy will be given attractive lease buy options for service beyond the original 5year period and flexibility in launch dates to execute the terms of the contract modification the navy requires 87 million by november 1 1981 for the contract modification to be implemented this is 59 million above the amount already included in the fiscal year 1982 budget request for operations and maintenance funds for the leasat program the current fiscal year 1982 budget request for 8 million reflects the funds originally considered to be required under the existing contract in order to effect these payments an additional 59 million must be authorized forfiscal year 1982 in the operations and maintenance account title iii of our bill the committee will propose a companion amendment to title iii to take care of the leasat funding shortfall when title iii is opened to amendment this amendment will not increase the amount authorized for navy operations and maintenance as a result of this significant slip in the leasat program the navy is we riously concerned about future availability of satellite communication service and the potential adverse impact on military operations it this service is not available over the years the navy has become increasingly dependent on communications satellites as has the entire department of defense landbased communication facilities have been drawn down in order to decrease the cost of operations reduce american military presence overseas and to improve worldwide defense related command control and communications this reliance on communication satellites goes to the very heart of the need to preserve a robust fleet satellite communication system a system that currently serves both tactical and strategic users this navy concern is shared by the unified and specified commanders the joint chiefs of staff and the air force even though the initial successful test of the space shuttle has increased hopes that the leased satellite system leasat will ultimately be put in service the administration believes that the fleet satellite or fltsat system must be continued as an insurance policy for a variety of reasons including strategic force requirements the military services current satellite communication capability is based on the five fleet satellites that were authorized prior to the direction to lease satellite communication service although the fleet satellite program was based on a satellite design life of less than 4 years the navy hopes it can obtain as much as 6 years of service from these same satellites this optimism is based on the excellent service and technical characteristics displayed by the four fleet satellites that are currently on orbit even with this potential longer life and without the always possible catastrophic satellite failure or the possible launch failure of the fifth fleet satellite in august of this year the navy would need to launch an additional satellite not later than may of 1985 to continue a viable military commnunications system worldwide if leasat service were not available because of space shuttle related or other difficult es to support such a launch date the only reasonable course would be the continuation of the proven vltsatcom program satellites to protect this option long lead materials need to be ordered in fiscal year 1982 in this context the procurement of three additional satellites would protect the militarily essential foursatellite constellation which provides for defensewide tactical requirements and sf1 ategic coverage long lead material for these satellites in the amount of 65 million would have to be placed on contract in early fiscal ye ar 1982 to execute this plan the need for such an insurance policy would of course become more pressing if the launch of the fifth fltsatcom satellite which is already procured and now scheduled for launch in august of this year were to be unsuccessful i believe it is important to continue the fleet satellite program i therefore request support for this amendment that provides the 65 million that is required to procure the long lead materials needed to protect the option to launch additional fleet satellites beginning in 1985 since the committee recommends a reduction of 70 2 million in navy missile procurement this addition would still leave the recommended authorization 5 2 million below the request for navy missiles and the total authorization in the bill1 380 2 million below the presidents request"],

established a comprehensive national approach to water pollution control the federal water pollution control act amendments of that year public law 92500 were a complete rewrite of existing water pollution control laws and stand as one of the great landmarks of environmental legislation as members know this year the administration sought a severely diminished role in the national clean water scheme the house public works committee held extensive hearings on the administrations legislative proposals and examined them thoroughly the committee beljeved that it would have an extremely disruptive effect on the construction of municipal treatment works which are already receiving federal grant assistance if there was one overriding theme which the committee held and pursued in the drafting of its legislation it was that it was essential to preserve existing grant eligibility provisions for those projects which are already underway this basic premise of the house was retained by its confercos in chicago our water quality problems are the same as many large urban areas probably the most significant problem we face is the pollution caused by combined sewer overflows also known as cso are a source of pollution which is expensive to control and difficult to quantify combined sewers are those sewers which carry both sanitary sewage and stormwater through the same sewer to the treatment plant during storm events the sewer system may become overloaded resulting in overflow of untreated sewage into the streams or back up into basements or streets csos have been recognized as a national problem however the midwestern states including illinois represent a major problem these states have over 50 percent of their population served by combined sewers the city of chicago in conjunction with the metropolitan sanitary district of greater chicago has devised an ambitious and unique plan for treating the citys water quality problems this plan the tunnel and reser oir project in chicago was developed after 20 years of study the twophase plan calls for building 131 miles of tunnels 150 to 300 feet below metropolitan chicago for pollution and flood control the tunnels lie under the chicago waterway so that a manmade river drilled out of solid rock lies beneath the streams at the surface the first phase started in 1975 involves 110 miles of tunnels to protect 180 miles of waterways from sewer overflows so far 47 miles of tunnels have been bored out by giant mining machines at a cost of 1 2 billion sixtythree miles are left to be drilled at a cost of 1 3 billion the pollution control tunnels are designed to catch the sewer overflows until a storm passes and the pollution can be pumped to the surface and treated it is estimated that phase one could cut sewage pollution by 85 percent passage of this legislation will insure the continued funding eligibility for this worthy project i am sure that chicago is not the only city with needed projects already

done carefully it is important that we keep alive the capabilities at barnwell as we carefully consider what the relative roles of industry and government should be therefore i oppose the derrickcorcoran amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment and in favor of the barnwell project and our reprocessing options the letter of president reagan says"],

to washington from my district out in idaho i had a unique experience over the weekend that i think reflects so well the very things the gentleman has been saying in the last several minutes as to how the american public perceives and understands what a tax cut is what a budget out of control is i would say to the gentleman from georgia i stood in a jc breakfast line for 2 hours on saturday morning and turned pancakes and listened to over 1 200 people as they came by me to offer comments about what is going on in washington they would say have you got the budget under control yet and are you really going to do what you said you were going to do in 1980 and that is cut that budget and get those taxes down so that we can get back to work one gentleman came along and he said i havent heard much about that democratic alternative budget yet but he said i read just a few comments about it in the paper the other morning he said you know there is not much out on it yet and apparently they are trying to rush something through he said from what i have read they are going to increase taxes again arent they and i said yes that is their plan to increase them some 140plus billions of dollars in the next 3 years he said well what is that going to do to me and my family am i going to have to pay more taxes and i said yes that is exactly what you are going to have to do they are going to force you to pay more taxes they are going to take more of your money away from you he said well cant you cut the budget isnt that the way you get interest rates down is to stop that kind of spending and that kind of demand on the money supply of this country and i said well that is what we have tried to do because we knew that is what you wanted as a working person as a small businessman and as a farmer and a rancher and as a bluecollar worker that you wanted more of your own money and you wanted to have the government take less of it away so i thank you today for taking this special order to clarify some of the points that are pretty hazy out there at this moment hazy only because they have not been spelled out the way you are spelling them out the american public understands very clearly what is going on at this moment they know what they asked for in 1980 and it has not been delivered to them we have only gotten a taste of it in the last 15 months and now the opposition is reaching out to grasp back and take away the very kinds of things they asked for because that is exactly what that budget alternative talks about is increased taxes increased spending that is the kind of business as usual that created those high interest rates and that high inflation and it is awfully important and the gentleman takes on a very important responsibility in spelling it out as clearly as he does that we are really back to business as usual when we get back to business as usual it really means no business at all when we have no business at all we have no jobs and then we will not have the kind of unemployment rates which we inherited from the spending of the 1960s and the 1970s but we will have much higher so i again congratulate the gentleman on taking this special order"]]}
