of our rivers and streams into sewers and poisoning water that must be used by human beings the clean water act of 1987 is an essential measure in our quest to make americas waters safe for fishing recreation and drinking in some areas of the nation pollution has caused the soil and water to become contaminated by carcinogenic materials leading to noticeably higher rates of death from cancer in those regions this legislation is a major advance toward the goal of providing greater safety for the public through the eventual elimination of pollutants from americas waterways this bill will reauthorize and strengthen the landmark federal water pollution control act of 1972 better known as the clean water act it contains a provision authorizing 18 billion over 8 years for building sewage treatment plants as well as a variety of other constructive measures for battling pollution this bill will provide badly needed federal funding to help municipalities finance their local sewage treatment construction a major innovation of this bill is the establishment of the state revolving loan fund which will be highly beneficial for arkansas and for the municipalities in the first district that i represent the state revolving loan fund will provide lowinterest loans to communities in need of sewage treatment systems the repayments of the loans will later be used to make new loans giving a selfsustaining source of funds for states to finance local water treatment construction there are now about 3 330 treatment plants in america that violate existing clean water act requirements by providing little or no sewage treatment it is futile for congress to require necessary water quality goals if municipalities lack the funds needed to assist them in meeting these standards this bill provides a solution to the problem for the short term the congress will appropriate federal funds to keep water treatment projects on track while establishing the selfsustaining fund that the states will use in the future to meet wastewater standards on their own another positive feature of this bill is its provision for providing 400 million to help states control nonpoint source pollutionsuch as runoff from streets parking lots or fields current law generally controls only pollution that comes from a specific source such as pipes or sewers in thus dealing with nonpoint source pollution the bill is attacking a problem that accounts for up to half of the water pollution in some areas of the country the clean water act also has a series of other amendments designed to strengthen americas effort to clean up the nations surface waters and make them suitable for fishing and swimming it will set new restrictions on discharges into waters where there are already high concentrations of toxic chemicals other amendments will regulate municipal and industrial stormwater discharges into the waterways and will require controls on surface runoff from city streets and agricultural areas i am particularly aware of the significance of the latter provision because of the great importance of agricultural areas in my district i am pleased to note that in addition to its vital effort to protect our people from contaminated water the bill will also be beneficial for economic growth in arkansas and in the first district because the sewage construction projects will provide jobs and stimulate local economies the sewage treatment plants will be one important component in developing the inffastructure of local areas many communities across the country face difficulties in promoting economic growth because they cannot meet the sewage treatment requirements set by the federal government by helping them to meet those standards this legislation will not only protect our water resources but will enhance the nations economic growth throughout the 1980s there has been vigorous public support for clean water for example a public opinion survey by louis harris in 1982 indicated that 94 percent of the american people believed that the clean water act should be kept as it is or made even stricter and more recent polls have reflected similar findings the bill has received enthusiastic support from a broad spectrum of groups including environmentalists industry labor unions and state and local governments the clean water act has widespread bipartisan support having passed house and senate by overwhelming margins in 1986 and again this year my home district in arkansas is blessed with many beautiful streams lakes and rivers this legislation is vital in the campaign to ensure that those waterways and others like them throughout america never become wastelands choked by pollutants it is time to clean up the waterways so that future generations will have the same opportunity to enjoy our waters that we still enjoy today today we can make an investment in americas future i urge my colleagues to override the veto because the

500 million a day in deficits thats 500 million a day in federal deficit if you take a journey and go in the wrong direction and discover it you make a u turn yet this president continues to insist we need higher defense spending the biggest part of the federal budget and no new revenue to pay for it he wants to stick to the tax cuts of 1981 at some point we have to have a national debate about this fiscal policy called reaganomics rather than debating the president i decided to remind my colleagues of the words of david stockman heres what the architect of this fiscal policy said this is from david stockmans book david stockmans own words about the president and his fiscal policy of borrow and spend borrow and spend with no leadership to turn it around here is what david stockman says about the program i the reagan revolution was radical imprudent and arrogant it defied the settled consensus of professional politicians and economists on its two central assumptions it mistakenly presumed that a handful of ideologues were right and all the politicians were wrong about what the american people wanted from government and it erroneously assumed that the damaged disabled inflationswollen unitedstates economy inherited from the carter administration could be instantly healed with history and most of the professional economists said it couldnt be pp 395 by the time of the white house debate of early november 1981 it had become overwhelmingly clear that the reagan revolutions original political and economic assumptions were wrong by a country mile by then the veil of the future had already parted and we were viewing reality from the other side what we saw invalidated the whole planright there and then pp 39596 the ensuring years only amplified what we had already learned by the eleventh month the final reckoning of the original fiscal plan of the reagan revolution shows where we were headed we were not headed toward a brave new world as i had thought n february where we were headed was toward a fiscal catastrophe pp 396 iii i was appalled by the false promises of the 1984 campaign ronald reagan had been induced by his advisers and his own illusions to embrace one of the more irresponsible platforms of modern times he had promised as it were to alter the laws of arithmetic no program that has name or line in the budget would be cut no taxes would be raised yet the deficit was pronounced intolerable and it was pledged to be eliminated pp 380 this was the essence of the unreality the president and his retainers promised to eliminate the monster deficit with spending cuts when for all practical purposes they had already embraced or endorsed 95 percent of all the spending there was to cut pp 380 iv i cannot be a patient with the white house by 1984 it had become a dreamland it was holding the american economy hostage to a reckless unstable fiscal policy based on the politics of high spending and the doctrine of low taxes yet rather than acknowledge that the resulting massive buildup of public debt would eventually generate serious economic troubles the white house proclaimed a roaring economic success it bragged that its policies had worked as never before when in fact they had produced fiscal excesses that had never before been imagined pp 377 v in 1984 we were plainly drifting into unprecedented economic peril but they had the audacity to proclaim a golden age of prosperity pp 377 what do you do when your president ignores all the palpable relevant facts and wanders in circles i could not bear to watch this good and decent man go on this embarrassing way i buried my head in my plate pp 375 vi our budget is now drastically out of balance not because this condition is endemic to our politics rather it is the consequence of an accident of governance which occurred in 1981 that it persists is due to the untenable antitax position of the white house after five years of presidential intransigence all of the normal mecha nisms of economic governance have become ensnared in a web of folly but this condition can be remedied whenever the white house decides to face the facts of life pp 392 meanwhile the economic danger mounts and the fiscal folly of the reagan revolutions aftermath reaches new heights pp 392 in the years ahead i continued to think that one day the president would realize the consequences of what had been done the day never came however pp 353 this was not democrats taking issue with the president but republicans david stockman saying this fiscal policy is fundamentally wrong ronald reagan travels to connecticut and colorado on the steps of the capitol buildings he says i want to change the constitution to prohibit deficits then he engages in a fiscal policy that gives us a half billion dollars in deficits every single day mr president we need some leadership we need it now we dont need slogans we dont need quotes from clint eastwood or vanna white we need leadership give us some you will

cuts without discretion and without consideration of which programs are truly needed which programs have already been cut to the bone and which programs can use some trimming housing programs for example have been cut by over 65 percent in the past 6 years i believe a direct result of this has been the dramatic increase in homeless individuals and families we have witnessed in recent years sequestration will not only reduce the funds available for assisted housing it will add to the extensive problems our nations cities are having trying to keep up with their homeless as a result of

several years our trade deficits last year were almost 170 billion this year every indication is that a trade deficit of the united states will be significantly higher than that most of the emphasis of the proposed legislation focuses on the unfair trade practices which have been conducted and are being waged by some of our trading partners against the united states and our businesses i think that we need for a moment before we examine this legislation and get into the debate on the specifics of it to take a broader overview look at the entire question of trade at what some of these terms mean and what we might be doing to ourselves and to our trading partners if we take actions that we may not understand to begin with first of all unfair trade practices trade deficits and competitiveness are terms that are used frequently but they are not wellunderstood and they simply do not necessarily go together and interrelate for example we have had essentially the same or worse unfair trade practices used against us and our products and our services for quite a number of years when we had very large trade surpluses so unfair trade practices in and of themselves do not equate to huge trade deficits in the united states legislation that addresses unfair trade practices alone by no means is going to solve the trade deficit situation in this country i think we need to understand what the primary causes are of trade deficits the trade deficits at least that we have now now there can be other causes in other times but right now there are three primary causes of our trade deficits the first primary cause is the simple fact that the unitedstates economy and the consumer demand of this country over the last several years since 1981 has grown at a significantly greater rate than the growth of the economies and consumer demands of our trading partners the second reason why we have these huge trade deficits is because we have huge domestic budget deficits and we have not been able to do more than contain the growth of those domestic budget deficits we have not been able to reduce the deficits themselves the third primary cause of our trade deficits stems from the ever persistent third world debt and its direct relationship to our ability to trade now let us examine those three primary causes because they need to be understood if we are going to understand the legislation we are about to tackle in the next couple of days what about our growth our economy has grown since 1981 at a pretty rapid rate yes the inflation rates are down still we do not have that high gnp that everybody has been looking for but when you look around the world relative to the economies or the other parts of the world our economy has grown at a significantly more rapid rate than theirs when this occurs several things happen one our consumer demand and our business demand for that matter is up in other words our demand for products and services is greater than theirs and the natural consequence of this demand in a growing economy that is greater than the growth of the other parts of the world is that we are going to import more goods to meet this demand than we export we are going to have to import those goods because our economy has not been producing enough to meet this growth demand so it is only natural that we run a trade deficit in that situation it might not have to be as big as the one we have now but we cannot get around running that kind of a trade deficit until our economy picks up the slack in the system or until the foreign countries that we deal with have their economies pick up we need to have those countries cooperate a little bit with us if we are going to resolve the trade deficits the best way they could cooperate would be to get their own economies growing more rapidly we have encouraged them to do that but so far they have not the most obvious method of doing it particularly among the european allies is to reduce some of their tax burdens so their businesses can expand and their economies flow frankly they have an undue fear of the growth of inflation which is very low now we are almost in deflation in parts of the world we need them to do that but we cannot do it for them we cannot really force them to do that we can cajole them we can urge them we can do all kinds of things but we cannot absolutely get them to do that i suppose they could lower some of their interest rates which are already pretty low a little further they could do a number of things like that but until their demand comes up until they begin to grow at a greater pace than they are now we are going to have a natural pressure that is going to result in our having trade deficits that does not have anything to do with unfair trade practices and does not have anything to do with anything we can legislate about frankly now in the same context of these factors of growth relative growth between our country and our trading partners we have to think about how we finance this growth and how we finance at the same time these huge budget deficits we have with this greater growth relative to the other economies and with these huge deficits on our own side our budget deficits we require relatively higher interest rates than the rest of the world in order to get foreign capital to come over here and finance this for us because we do not have it inherently in our system again that is a natural equation in economics it is very simple it is fairly easily understood by those are involved though the language barriers often get in our way while our interest rates are nowhere near the extraordinarily high interest rates of 7 or 8 years ago when they went right through the ceiling we have had even though we had what we thought were modest rates of april 2 7 1987 congre maybe 7 v2 percent prime and 9 percent for some home mortgages and so on they just a month or so ago those rates are expand still

000ship soviet navy the unitedstates navy holds its own because of superior electronics and design if the soviets had the same technology and if they used it the sheer weight of numbers would favor the soviets in any possible confrontation that is why technology transfer to any country concerns me but in view of the recent toshiba scandal transfers of technology worry me greatly the toshiba

billion in defense spending but not at the same time safeguard the secrets that are necessary to insure our defense further why should foreigners be subject to differentand laxer espionage laws than

aspects there are economic reasons also to build a frigate with aegis capabilities costs somewhere in the neighborhood of 750 million in the united states in japan this same ship would cost an additional 200 million if the japanese used prevailing united states contracting officer logic there would be no question that it would be purchased in the united statesbecause its cheaper over here i

of spending that was not approved by the president of the united states a republican the senate of the united states under republican leadership and this house under democrat leadership so to pretend

cuts that were to be balanced with tax increases well 20 percent of the spending cuts are asset sales those are not spending cuts those are new revenues another 8 percent is increased collections through the irs that is not spending cuts that is new revenues and another portion of the spending cuts is the reduction in debt service costs due to saving 36 billion but if you do not save 36

state and on june 10 of this year by president ronald reagan in a letter to representative michel which read i ask you to support quick and unencumbered passage of authorizing legislation for the gci this rule is requested and supported by the administration and by the ranking republican on the banking committee and the banking subcommittee chairmen and myself in behalf of the administration a few

and we are considering a proposed appropriation action of 50 million please do not confuse what is prepared with some 14 billion figure if members take a look at what the american contribution 18 percent of the total governmental contribution means it means a leveraging of the united states paid in capital contributions for world bank activity by 70 times or even as much as 200 times depending on how one counts it i think if we take a look at the way the world bank has been moving in the last several years or at the kind of record our former colleague world bank president barber conable one of the most distinguished men to leave this body in this century has established it will be noted for at least three things first the environmental review and policy change that he has made in the world bank lending practices directly in answer to appropriate criticisms of those concerned about world bank loans second to encourage to recognize and to promote the role of women in development and third the encouragement of privatization thus moving these countries to marketoriented economies with exportimport opportunities and other crucial economic and structural reform loans geared toward structural reform today range up to 25 percent of the total loan activity i think it is important that the united states live up to its intention to authorize our contributions for 6 years the united states is the nation that asked for the longer 6year authorization period in order to spread our payment over that longer period of time the british for example contributed all of their additional capital immediately indeed most of the countries the majority necessary to make this gci happen have already made their contribution youve heard already about the undistinguished notions in which the united states finds itself today in having failed to meet its general capital increase commitment i also heard reference to the nation of ethiopia let it be crystal clear that ethiopia is too poor to qualify for the ibrd loans that are authorized and appropriated by this action on the gci ethiopia and what its policies are is not a factor ethiopia is too poor to qualify for the ibrd loan program

japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a copy of a recent article by richard perle president reagans former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy regarding the toshiba machine incident h j res 327 joint resolution requiring the president or his designee to enter into negotiations with japan for the purpose of having japan bear a greater share of the free worlds defense burden by either increasing its annual defense expenditures to at least 3 percent of japans gross national product or by obtaining payment by japan to the united states of the difference between 3 percent of japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to protect and augment freedom democracy and capitalism throughout the world the global markets upon which exporting nations depend would not be available whereas the recent developments in the persian gulf bring to light once again the dependence of our allies on the united states for the protection of strategic international sea lanes so vital to the industrialized democracies whereas 37 percent of the oil consumed by the united states 100 percent of the oil consumed by japan 100 percent of the oil consumed by west germany 94 percent of the oil consumed by france and 100 percent of the oil consumed by italy is imported whereas 4 percent of the oil consumed by the united states and 60 percent of the oil consumed by japan passes through the gulf of hormuz whereas there have been disturbing revelations that the japanese company toshiba machine has on two occasions sold strategic technological equipment to the soviet union which gives the soviets the ability to reduce the noise level of their submarines by a factor of twenty significantly undermining the security of the united states and the rest of the free world whereas at a time when the necessary financial commitment to national security is particularly burdensome to the american economy given its increasing national debt the trade deficit relatively high interest rates and the erosion of united states manufacturing jobs this sale with the approval of the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti is looked on with particular disdain whereas in 1985 the united states spent 7 percent of its gnp on defense the soviet union spent 14 percent of its gnp on defense our european allies spent an average 3 5 percent of their gnp on defense and japan spent 1 of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963 trillion in 1986 and had an inflation rate of 1 percent and an unemployment rate of 2 8 percent during the same period whereas the united states overall trade deficit in 1986 was 166 3 billion and 50 billion in the first three months of 1987 and our trade deficit with japan alone was 58 6 billion in 1986 whereas with soviet aggression in af for one year for the rest of the huge corpoghanistan soviet inroads in central amer ration it will be business as usual c

soviets and their allies and it would on the theory that the list of forbidden exports is too long arbitrarily release 40 percent of the items now controlled without regard to the security consequences of such an indiscriminate policy having voted consistently to slash unitedstates defenses bonker and his house allies would now imperil us further by facilitating soviet acquisition of our technology while similar legislation in the senate doesnt go quite as far the bill put together by the senate banking committee and shaped largely by sen john heinz r pa shares many of the worst features of hr3 one can only hope that the senate armed services committee under chairman sam nunn dga will take time to review the bill that has emerged from the banking committee and recommend changes aimed at protecting national security war after all is too important to be left to the bankers since 1981 the reagan administration has been pressing its allies to follow our lead in restricting the flow of technology tothe soviets thus passage of the house or even the senate bill as it now stands would do irreparable damage to our credibility abroad six years of cajoling pleading bargaining and negotiating will be made to appear a capricious ephemeral impulse rather than the serious policy initiative the president intended what congress simply doesnt understand is that no president can defend our interests in this or any other matter if his policies can be snapped around like a rubber band the march so evident in congress and in such executive agencies as the department of commerce to weaken export controls is lumbering forward behind the banner of competitiveness this years slogan masquerading as a policy the fellows who want to keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic red tapea complaint that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige whose department dispenses red tape by the mile echoes happily at industry lunches and in congressional testimony now if mac would put the time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the western alliance the president who has taken the lead in arguing for effective export controls will appear pale and depleted if he falls to take charge of the kongsbergtoshlba affair and abandoning policies aimed at protecting our technology will diminish both consistency and credibilityand our security as well ronald reagans signature on a bill that vitiates the effectiveness of export controls for national security purposes

like to quote from some remarks that were made by our secretary of state george shultz before the american bar association that i think succinctly outline the threat of having a cuba in nicaragua we forget that cuba is on our shores and we forget what cuba is all about now we also forget about world war ii and early in the second world war german uboats destroyed unitedstates merchant shipping in the caribbean at a faster rate than we could replace it this is quoting secretary shultz but he more aptly outlines the threat that we now have in cuba and i quote one serious blow to this hemispheres security was struck in 1959 when fidel castro established a communist dictatorship in cuba and brought that island into the soviet camp he goes on today the soviet union cuba as an important military base in this hemisphere from cuba the soviet union flies reconnaissance flights up and down the east coast of the united states in cuba the soviet union has a port of call for its submarines from cuba the soviet union monitors united states communications using one of the largest and most effective electronic surveillance sites in the world cuban troops act as soviet surrogates in ethiopia and angola the cuban government smuggles arms and provides aid and training to guerrillas and terrorists throughout the western hemisphere in the event of a conventional war in europe or in the persian gulf cuba would constitute a threat to our ability to aid our allies and defend our strategic interests in those vital regions the secretary also said we risked nuclear confrontation with the soviet union over the removal of their missiles from cuba today we must spend billions of dollars to strengthen our counterintelligence apparatus and our naval and air defenses against soviet use of an island 90 miles off our shore and we learned the value of such an outpost to the soviet union which spends and i think this is important which spends over 4 billion every year to sustain three times

1988 this vital legislation offers a helping hand to our nations farmers who have been hard hit by the drought that has swept the midwest as a cosponsor of this important legislation i would like to commend my colleagues on the agriculture committee for the expeditious manner in which they have moved the final bill to the house floor without a doubt we are facing the worst drought to grip the country in over 50 years all 72 wisconsin counties have been declared disaster areas wisconsins rural communities dependent on agriculture have been particularly hard hit everyone from the local shopkeeper to th3 implement dealer has felt economic pressures from the drought in my district which encompasses northeast wisconsin over 65 percent of the hay crop and 45 percent corn crop have already been lost a ton of hay selling for 50 last year is now selling for over 150 the feed costs for next year will eat up an additional 12 000 to 15 000 of the farmers budget thats a lot of money for a wisconsin dairy farmer who normally has a profit margin of only 10 000 to 15 000 the emergency drought legislation will help farmers make it through the remainder of the year and ensure that they will be able to plant their crops next year the measure will preservo the economies of droughtstricken rural communities and prevent a sqrious disruption in the supply of food to american consumers the drought assistance act provides relief to all sectors of our nations agricultural economy including crop producers livestock producers dairy farmers and agribusinesses wisconsin farmers will directly benefit from many of the provisions in the bill specifically the feed assistance provisions and disaster payments will help those farmers who grow their own crops up to 50 percent of the cost of feed and transportation will be available to those procucqrs who have had substantial feed production ic es farmers suffering over a 35percent loss oi crops will be eligible for direct disaster payments b4 a rate of 65 percent of the target price or support price farmers with losses on 90 percent or more will get additional aid advance deficiency payments on crops will not have to

with a 50cent cut in the dairy price support next january 1 and starting next april 1 a temporary 3month increase of 50cents in the dairy price support will be provided this increase which runs through july 1 1989 will help offset any destabilization of the price of milk during next springs flush season elimination of the 50cent cut will save wisconsin dairy farmers an estimated 130 million in lost income next year and the modest increase in the price support during the spring will go a long way toward preventing disruption in our nations milk supply and skyrocketing costs for consumers
