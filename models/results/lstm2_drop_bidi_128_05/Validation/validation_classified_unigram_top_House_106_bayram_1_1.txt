the ones who stand to gain the most from this legislation are not the seniors that the republicans would lead you to believe but the multimillion dollar drug companies that only stand to get wealthier as a result of this legislation i the republican leaderships prescription drug plan fails miserably to help our nations seniors the leadership should be ashamed to submit a plan that forces seniors to shop around for benefits when there is no guarantee that the insurance companies will continue to provide the benefit a year or two down the road especially when the fees for such a plan can be raised to exorbitant rates a better solution is president clintons plan which provides guaranteed benefits through medicare allows seniors to keep their current prescription drug plan if they choose and provides 100 percent of prescription expenses for lowincome seniors i support the presidents plan because the plan provides affordable voluntary and reliable prescription coverage for all seniors give

same republican voices were being raised in this room maybe not the same individuals but the same philosophy and they said just extend the welfare program and take care of those most in need they were opposed to medicare in fact you remember it was only a short while ago that bob dole was bragging about how he was one of a few people to stand up and oppose medicare and speaker newt gingrich was in this very room and he was boasting of the need to let medicare wither on the vine they do not really believe in medicare and this is a way to start the concept that we just need a welfare plan for those most in need i think medicare and social security have been two of the best programs this congress has ever devised under democratic leadership over republican opposition and over continued republican efforts to undermine those programs i believe if we go with a welfare program for prescription drugs that is really what the focus will be the second very important point the gentleman makes is just turning this over to the states is not a very good answer texas could have done this but texas has not unfortunately met the needs of its seniors on prescription drugs it has not done anything and when texas had the opportunity after democratic leadership in promoting the childrens health insurance program to provide health insurance to meet the needs of children in our state and we have in texas more uninsured children than any state in the country i think except possibly one we are right at the top and we unfortunately at the state level there were delays no effort was made to expedite the program and texas has foregone hundreds of millions of dollars that could have helped get children there with insurance for prescriptions and other things with that kind of example it

voted three times in recent years to raise the limit and president clinton has requested repealing this earnings limit in his last two budgets the sooner we send this to his desk the faster we will be able to deliver this relief to seniors who want to continue making a real contribution to our society and our economy unlike a republican attempt to raise the limit in 1998 the bill we debate today does not hurt the longterm solvency of social security to do so this reform is long overdue it is about time that we stand up for americas seniors according to federal reserve chairman greenspan we are beginning to suffer from a serious worker shortage that threatens our economic expansion this bill will play a major role in protecting our economic gains of the last 7 years it will not only help raise the standard of living for many of our seniors but it will also help us keep the strongest economic growth of our lifetime on track by keeping a generation of skilled workers in the edonomy i met with a number of small business owners in south county st louis in my district this past weekend and they talked about their need to hire workers over the age of 65 because they are having such

thank the gentleman for taking the time today and giving the blue dog democrats and perhaps others hopefully on both sides of the aisle the opportunity to engage in this debate before we get into the political debate of tomorrow it is difficult to be perceived as being against a tax cut particularly when you agree that the marriage tax penalty should be corrected but it is not difficult to oppose a bill that not only corrects the marriage tax penalty but also gives a marriage bonus to those that are currently getting a bonus i am sure in the limited time tomorrow we will not have an opportunity to fully debate that but the real purpose for which we take this hour today is to talk about why paying down the debt should be the number one priority for this congress and why some of us on this side of the aisle feel so strongly that not following the regular order of determining the priorities of the congress is a drastic fiscal mistake we now have the opportunity to pay down this debt we all talk about if and this is one of the big questions if the projected surpluses materialize that is why we and the blue dogs have been saying now for quite some time let us not spend projected surpluses as if they are real money surpluses that may or may not occur in 2007 2008 2009 2010 is that conservatism are we going to go back to the same fiscal policies that we followed in the 1980s when we borrowed over 3 trillion pursuing a fiscal policy that did not quite work out unless you perceive that borrowing money by the federal government taking that money away from the private sector is a good investment we do not we happen to believe that paying down the debt and the fact we are now going to be in our third year of seeing our federal debt that which the federal government is borrowing be reduced is good fiscal policy and has contributed to the fact that we now have the longest single economic recovery period in the history of our country economic expansion that unemployment has now hit and gone below 4 percent that we have more people working in america than at any other time in the history of our country we think that is the result of something that we have been doing right and that is that we have been living since 1993 on a course that has gotten us into the position now of actually being able to debate what we are going to do with projected surpluses to those that suggest that we start out with a tax cut you are in fact saying that the plight of rural hospitals is of secondary importance the fact that we have over 250 representatives from rural communities all over the united states in washington as i speak begging us for additional investment in hospital care in rural areas that that is of secondary importance and we are not even going to discuss that until later and perhaps never get there because when you make the argument of a 1 3 trillion tax cut you will find there is no money available in the budget for additional investments and needed investments in any program to those that suggest that we should start with a tax cut you are saying that we do not need to invest any further in the defense capabilities of this country that thereis no need for us to do anything but freeze defense spending for the next 10 years at current levels and anyone knows what that will do to the ability of the united states to defend ourselves against what might happen in the next 10 years why are we not debating what the priority investments should be along with how we shall deal with our tax code it is no secret we have real problems in rural america in the farming sector the president has proposed putting into the budget debate an investment an expenditure if you please of taxpayer dollars should that not be debated and if the majority of this house feels that is not a prudent investment have it voted down should that not be considered in the budget process when we talk about spending we have those that believe and sincerely believe that all federal spending almost is a waste of money they choose to close their eyes to the fact that we the congress in a bipartisan way over the last 4 5 or 6 years have done a pretty darn good job of restraining discretionary spending a pretty darn good job can we do better yes should we do better absolutely but can we do it in a way in which we say we are going to freeze and continue cutting in the area of defense of agriculture of health care i repeat if we cannot find it in our wisdom to recognize that rural areas are being substantially penalized to the degree that we will have to close hospital after hospital after hospital unless we can find it in our hearts and in our judgment to increase spending in this area then we have to be prepared to suffer the consequences now i do not think that is what the congress will do but my question is simply this to the leadership why did you choose to come with the first bill of the year with a tax cut that is politically attractive why do you choose to ignore the budget process that we all say we believe in and in which we will make tough choices why do you short circuit it unless it is as some suggest a politically attractive way to get to the 1 trillion tax cut without anybody ever having to face up to the realitfes of what we are talking about i think we are making a bad mistake when we do that as members before me have said today i support dealing with the intricacies of the tax code that penalize couples for being married that is ridiculous let us fix that part but let us do it in the context of a total budget approach that will not jeopardize the economic recovery we have been in now for the last 7 years and that we have all indications we can continue if we just manage to stay on course i want to repeat again and then i will yield back we are in danger if we choose this road that we start tomorrow we are in danger of saying to our rural communities i am sorry but there is no money left for investment in health care in rural communities that is the choice we are in danger of saying there is no money to be used for increasing the durability and longevity and strength of the defenses of this country which most of us agree need to be done why are we not having that argument first that is our question we will have a motion that will provide that we can do everything everybody talks about if it is possible to do it within the context of a budget and tough decisions one of those needs to be being a little conservative with our first bill out of the box i hope that we will find a way to do that one last point i get real concerned when i see the leadership of the house of representatives continuing continuing to ignore the need of making changes in our social security system and our medicare system for the future i get very concerned when i continue to hear the finger pointing of the house of representatives leadership towards the administration for not dealing with social security and medicare and medicaid when everyone knows we can do it in the house of representatives why have we not spent one second talking about the future needs of social security in the context of the budget if we are going to fix social security for the future so our children and grandchildren will have the same benefits that we have today those on it today it is going to require some changes and it is going to require changes that will cause the need of utilizing some of those surplus dollars we are talking about but we completely ignore that and i think that

program improving federal crop insurance has long been a priority for me h r 2559 is the result of many hours of work to try and give farmers better and more affordable coverage we also intend to make usda more efficient in administering the program while at the same time cutting down on fraud and abuse finally we hope to give producers producer organizations insurance companies and universities the ability to work together to create better more workable crop insurance policies the subcommittee conducted a series of hearings all over the country last year and the year before that were designed to gather information from producers as to what was wrong with our crop insurance program we had hearings in western michigan sioux falls south dakota perry and douglas georgia laurinburg north carolina and lexington kentucky many ideas were presented to us and many of these ideas eventually were incorporated in this bill before us today crop insurance has become a vital link to the soundness and prosperity of american agricultural producers it is a safety net that assists the producer in managing risk on the farm it allows the producer not the government to decide how to manage this risk be it financial market or legal risk by no means has the program been perfect and it is unrealistic to expect the same program to always work well in every part of the country in the past crop insurance has worked well in many regions but in other areas such as california florida and maine the program has not worked as well during our meetings and hearings some producers advocated complete elimination of the program some advocated elimination of the actuarial soundness standard some supported retaining the program but believed improvements including increased premium subsidies modified rating practices modified aph determination and the development of a costofproduction crop insurance policy were needed what we did do that is very important in this bill is we provided higher premium support to allow more farmers to afford the purchase of this improved crop insurance policy we also addressed the problem of yield averages to allow farmers to eliminate those bad years in their average so that they can actually purchase insurance to cover what they normally can produce the improved policies also allow producers to buy income protection a much needed improvement in

is about getting the information in the proper hands so that instead of an awful recall instead of a body count accumulating before defective products are taken off the market that in fact those

introduce legislation with strong bipartisan support that will not only save american consumers billions of dollars it will also remove a significant federal barrier to a more competitive electric power industry more than 20 years ago the public utility regulatory policies act purpa was enacted as one of the original components of the carter energy plan convinced that we were running out of natural gas and that the price of oil would soar to 100 per barrel or even more by the year 2000 congress passed purpa to encourage conservation and promote the use of renewable fuels to generate electricity it did this by establishing a special class of power generators known as qualifying facilities ofs and it required utilities to buy all the electricity that these facilities wished to sell at a price determined generally by federal regulators and specifically by state regulators congress sought in drafting purpa to ensure that customers would pay no more for purpa power than they would have to pay for other power it did this by providing in purpa that the maximum price for electricity from qfs would be the cost that the purchase utility would have incurred if it had generated the electricity itself or had purchased it from a source other than the qf unfortunately this has not proven to be the case because govemnment projections of utility avoided costs have been seriously in error one recent study estimates that purpa is costing electricity consumers nearly 8 billion a year in excess power costs since over 60 percent of purpa contracts will not expire until after the year 2010 consumers will continue to pay these excess costs well into the future purpa also stands in the way of a more competitive electric industry by granting special status to some electricity generators but not others purpa encourages the creation of uneconomic projects just to qualify for purpa benefits moreover purpa was premised on utilities continuing to be the exclusive suppliers of electricity to all consumers within their franchise territories in many states today customers have the ability to choose their own electric supplier requiring utilities to purchase new purpa power when they may no longer have retail customers to whom they can resell power makes no sense with 20 years of experience behind us it is clear that purpa has outlived its usefulness my legislation would do three things to reform purpa 1 it would prospectively repeal purpas mandatory purchase obligation on the date of enactment so that there would no longer be any new obligations to purchase this power 2 it would respect the sanctity of existing purpa contracts and 3 it would ensure that purchasing utilities would continue to be permitted to recover the costs of existing purpa contracts as long as these contracts are in effect as i said upon introduction of virtually identical legislation during the last two congresses my only interest in introducing this bill lies in achieving the most efficient and most costeffective means of electric generation for americas consumers while it would prospectively repeal purpa and would ensure that no new purpa contracts would be required it recognizes the legitimate current expectations of qf developers and utility purchasers i believe that it represents a broad based consensus on this important issue and i would urge that this measure be included in whatever electric industry legislation might be considered by this congress"], [0.9856890439987183, 0.9856890439987183, 0, "i move to strike the requisite number of words i rise in

constituents i many of myconstituents throughout the long years of the cold war worked at a facility in southern ohio which enriches uranium during the early days of the cold war that facility enriched uranium which went into our nuclear weapons in more recent years that facility has produced enriched uranium necessary to create the fuel that produces the nuclear power generated in this country the electricity through nuclear power two years ago this administration and this congress privatized that industry and just a few weeks ago this new privatized corporation announced that it was closing the facility in my district thereby terminating the employment of some nearly 2 000 men and women these are individuals who have served our country well many of them have been exposed to dangerous chemicals and to radiation they have developed cancers many have lost their lives later on this week i am introducing legislation which will set in motion a process whereby this government can once again assume ownership of this industry why would i do this and why is it important to the economic and energy security of our nation it is because some 23 percent of the electricity generated in this country is generated through nuclear power only two facilities in this country enrich the uranium which is necessary to produce the fuel forthese nuclear power plants the direction of this privatized corporation troubles me i am very concerned that their ultimate goal is not to be producers of enriched uranium but simply to become brokers of enriched uranium it is my concern that their ultimate goal is not only to close my facility but also to close the facility in paducah kentucky if that were to happen this nation would become totally dependent on foreign sources for at least 20 percent of all of the electricity that is generated in this country we cannot let that happen as a body as a group of elected representatives of the people we must not allow ourselves to become dependent on foreign sources for a huge portion of all of the electricity generated within this country i am calling tonight upon my colleagues to join me in the introduction of this legislation it is essential and necessary we made a mistake when we privatized this vital industry we made a mistake when we turned it over to the private sector who are not necessarily loyal to this country or to the objectives of this government they are not necessarily loyal to the energy security need of this nation their primary objective is to their investors and their stockholders i am deeply troubled that the individual that oversaw the privatization process the individual who was the ceo of the public corporation before it became private was dealing with a major major conflict of interest as a government employee he was making approximately 350 000 a year once this became a privatized corporation his salary skyrocketed to 2 48 million a year not only that but he convinced the board of directors to give him a golden parachute of 3 6 million if he is fired or he loses his job he can walk away with 3 6 million the workers in my district many of them who have served this country as cold war warriors who have exposed themselves to dangerous conditions are being terminated of their jobs many with only weeks to go before they qualify for retirement it is simply wrong it

blood and american tax dollars if we have no national interest in kosovo why did we lose so many lives in europe in two world wars if we have no national interest in kosovo why did we spend billions of tax dollars on the reconstruction of europe through the marshall plan in the aftermath of world war ii it seems that we have forgotten that the balkans are an integral part of europe and that kosovo as president bush first enunciated is critical to the peace and stability in the balkans senator dole got it right when he testified before the committee on international relations advocating our engagement and involvement in kosovo i am quoting senator dole it is in americas interest to have a stable democratic and prosperous europe as did ambassador jeane kirkpatrick who served so well as our u n ambassador under president reagan she stated at that same hearing and again i am quoting i think that peace and security and the human rights of the people in the region and the future of nato and a democratic peaceful prosperous europe are all in the balance in kosovo we should be proud that it was the united states that helped nurture prosperity and democratic institutions in europe in the latter part of this century for that investment truly changed the course of history and has not just benefited europe but our nation and our people the prosperity that we have enjoyed in this decade can be partially traced to the reality of a europe increasingly democratic in terms of its political institutions with economies based on free market principles we are joined at the hip let us be clear about that but it is to our mutual advantage an expanded european union represents a future of unprecedented peace and prosperity for a continent that has been ravaged by war throughout recorded history and the genocidal ethnic cleansing of milosevic is perhaps the final challenge hopefully to achieving that vision so when we ask what our national interest is in kosovo it is not simply kosovo it is more much more it is about europe and beyond europe in the socalled christmas warning of 1992 it was president bush that warned milosevic if he attacked kosovo that the unitedstates would support a military intervention if necessary early in his administration president clinton confirmed the bush warning it was the conclusion of both administrations that conflict in kosovo would destabilize the entire region and potentially threaten all of europe it would indeed be tragic at this point in time to have defeated fascism in the 1930s and the 1940s to have prevailed over communism in the 1980s only to lose the peace at the end of the century we may do just that by a unilateral withdrawal at this point in time i submit that the action would be irresponsible

before you call it genocide and im reminded of the book the greatest generation by tom brokaw and im proud to be a part of that generation and one of the things we failed to do in that generation was to nip genocide in the bud it happened we let it happen and we stood back and we did nothing let us not sometime in the future reflect back on this day with the same regrets expressed so eloquently by

process the bill that we will be making in order with this rule is a product of the work of both the committee on the budget and the committee on rules and the efforts that we have put in for a long time it also represents a landmark process in which those two committees of jurisdiction over the budget process have come together in a bipartisan manner and i have got to stress that word bipartisan again the gentleman from maryland has been working for years and years on this with the gentleman from iowa and with the gentleman from florida mr goss and with the rest of us and it is due to their spectacular leadership that we have gotten to the point where we are today as the gentleman from iowa said just a few minutes ago it is very clear that the budget process that we have now does not work it is a disorganized patchwork of decades old rules and laws the bipartisan comprehensive budget reform act will make the process more rational it improves accountability and it strengthens enforcement in the budget process is it a panacea to all the ailments of society no is it a cureall for all of the challenges that we face on the budget process no but i will tell my colleagues it is a very very important step which enjoys again bipartisan support one item in here i will say as a californian that i think is a very important aspect is the issue of dealing with natural disasters we all know that they are a fact of life whether it is hurricanes in florida or ice storms in upstate new york or floods in iowa or in my home state we all know what we get we get earthquakes in california we know that there is going to be some kind of disaster and it will have an impact on the budget this bill requires the president and the congress to face reality and set aside a disaster

place in this bill the rule also makes in order a number of amendments for members with very very diverse views on this issue such amendments include biennial budgeting which the gentleman from ohio mentioned and i will be offering later an automatic continuing resolution and paygo all of these amendments are very important reform issues and they deserve to be fully and openly considered in this debate which is what this rule actually does now i will take just a moment to talk about this issue which i feel so strongly about and that is the question of biennial budgeting that process could lead to the most significant change in the budget process that we have had in over a quarter century really since the 1974 budget empowerment act was put into place biennial budgeting would be the most sweeping reform the enormous amount of resources that are expended by the executive branch in preparing multiple annual budgets at the same time would be diverted to longterm strategic planning and improving the performance of federal programs again this effort is put together with strong bipartisan support and enjoys the strong support of president clinton who in his budget submission earlier this year called for biennial budgeting vice president al gore the presumptive democratic nominee for the president of the united states he is a strong proponent of biennial budgeting governor george bush of texas the presumptive nominee and i hope the next president of the united states is in fact a strong proponent he has a 2year budget process in texas and believes that we should do it

census and about how we have heard words like partisan motives and tactics and basically the same things that we have been hearing for years that democrats have been attacking republicans for back room maneuvers and saying all these horrible things because we do not want people to be represented according to them as my colleagues know the one thing though that i find really intriguing about this debate is that while republicans are being attacked for this the one thing that we do not hear about when it comes to reapportionment and when it comes to using the census to count voters in 2000 is the fact that this decision has already been reached not in a back room in congress not by meanspirited republicans getting together and figuring out how they can harm human beings but now it has been decided already across the street by the united states supreme court who ruled not long ago just a month or two ago that it is unconstitutional it is unconstitutional to run a census the way the administration and the way that the radical left wants to run the census ih 2000 i say radical left why do i say radical i say radical and my definition of radical is somebody or a group of legislators who want to radically break with the past and that is what this is all about as my colleagues know they can talk about scientific means of measurement they can talk about fairness they can talk about whatever they want to talk about but when they turn and point and blame the republicans for the census in 2000 they are avoiding some very basic facts the main fact they are avoiding is and there are two facts actually first fact is the united states supreme court says it is unconstitutional to guess how many americans should be able to vote in an election it is unconstitutional the second fact that they conveniently avoid so they can come down here and make meanspirited radical assertions that just are not based on fact is that the united states constitution itself the framework for this great constitutional republic says itself that you have got to count each person when we decide about reapportionment now what did we hear as my colleagues know i do not know why we did not hear that other than it does not really play into their strong point as well as criticizing republicans attacking us as meanspirited listen the republicans on this issue are irrelevant if they have a problem they need to take it up with the united states supreme court they need to take it up with madison and hamilton and those people that drafted the united states constitution over 200 years ago now maybe they do not like the constitution maybe they think that this part of the constitution is not suited well for the 21st century maybe they want a radical departure from our history maybe they want to take an extremist approach because they think they can pick up four or five seats but i can tell my colleagues the supreme court the united states constitution and 222 years of american history does not support their argument facts are stubborn things facts not name calling not meanspirited attacks facts are stubborn things it reminds me during the impeachment hearings and even before the impeachment hearings as we led up to the impeachment hearings i remember ken starr being castigated time and time again he is a renegade ken starr is dangerous he is trying to do things that he should not be able to do that is what we heard from the radical left but facts are stubborn things the presidents attorneys the radical left the democratic caucus all would attack ken starr and say he was doing things that would destroy the presidency and the constitution and yet every time the legal question was taken to the united states supreme court the united states supreme court the highest court in the land would come back and defend ken starrs right to conduct his legal investigation now whether colleagues agreed with mr starrs investigation or not do not say that he is an outofcontrol prosecutor that is trying to violate the law because the highest court in the land the court sanctioned by the united states constitution 222 years ago said that what mr starr was asking for was constitutionally correct now again maybe the radical left the presidents counsel and the entire democratic caucus does not like the constitution maybe they are offended by 222 years of history but do not attack the person that is living by the law and the constitution because facts are stubborn things this is something i have seen now for 4 years it was about 4 5 years ago that i was an american that sat on my couch and watched the news watched cspan had never been involved in politics i decided that i should get off the couch come to washington and try to make a change i did that i have to tell the members i was shocked absolutely shocked by some of the meanspirited things that were said from the left to the right any time they disagreed on principle they would attack personally i just do not know how many times i have heard somebody from the radical left call an opponent a nazi because they disagreed with them politically a nazi a member of an organization that killed 6 million jews just because you disagree with the way somebody votes on a school lunch program whether someone wants it administered by the state the local school agency or the federal government does not mean that we should resort to this meanspirited radical approach it is just like social security i do not know how many times i have heard people on the left talk about social security and talk about how republicans want to destroy social security we have heard it from the administration time and time again it is almost like they a onetrick pony that is all they know how to do is to scare people once again facts are stubborn things it was just this week that cbo director crippen criticized the president and the administration and for doing what for planning to raid the social security trust fund by 270 billion steal 270 billion from social security even in washington d c even among the radical left 270 billion is a lot of money the idea was let us go ahead and raid social security for 270 billion take it from social security put it in the general account and then after we steal 270 billion from this federal program that was set up on a promise then we spend that 270 billion on new federal programs new bureaucracies making new promises that this government will not keep we have to say once and for all to this administration and to those on the left that want to raid the social security trust fund to create new bureaucracies and new jobs and new power in washington d c keep your hands off social security keep your hands off social security there is a republican plan by the gentleman from california that would allow us to finally after all of these years keep politicians hands off of social security this plan would set aside the social security trust fund and stop politicians from raiding that trust fund the president would not be able to steal 270 billion from the social security trust fund members of the radical left would not be able to create new federal jobs create new federal bureaucracies and create new federal regulations with their illgotten dollars instead we would set aside social security we weuld keep it solvent not only for my parents but for all of americans we have got to do that we have got to stop looting the social security trust fund ironically this is something that back in 1995 when i came here with a group of 73 other freshmen republicans we actually put out a bill that mark neumann helped draft that would set aside the social security trust fund and protect social securitys funds for our seniors we were told at the time it was radical that nobody would do it that listen we have to go ahead and count the social security trust fund and raid it or there is no way we can balance the budget the administrations budgets looted social security right now though i think we are getting to a point where most conservative and moderate members of congress agree that we have got to keep social security safe and keep it offbudget so our grandparents and our parents will be able to get back the money that they put in is it a plan that will work i do not know but i would like the administration i would like members of the radical left i would like everybody to come to the table and at least talk about it instead of saying let us raid social security by 270 billion and then turning around and saying we are the ones that are protecting social security they cannot have it both ways either they are for protecting social security and keeping their hands off the social security trust fund or they want to raid social security to the tune of 270 billion like the administration to create bigger federal bureaucracies they cannot have it both ways facts are stubborn things why are we in a position now that we can set aside the social security trust fund it is because when we came here in 1995 we were not only concerned about senior citizens we were concerned about our children we were concerned about teenagers we were concerned about people in their 20s 30s and 40s and people who would be on social security down the road the only way we could take care of our future leaders the only way we could allow them to enjoy the american dream that so many americans have enjoyed in this great american century was to stop raiding social security and stop stealing from our next generation when we got here the deficit was 300 billion 300 billion the debt was 5 trillion what does that mean it is hard to figure out exactly how much money that is all i can say is this senator bob kerrey headed up a bipartisan task force on social security and his social security task force back in 1994 concluded that if social security spending and if spending on our federal budget continued at current rates then people in their teens and twenties would be paying 89 percent of their paychecks 89 percent of their paychecks just to pay off their federal taxes i think what senator kerrey did was a courageous thing senator simpson now retired was also on that commission it is a commission that came up with good conclusions regarding the solvency of social security what does that mean i guess we have to boil this down basically as much as we can so people in their teens and twenties can understand let us say you have a job at wendys and you make 200 a parttime job and you make 200 every 2 weeks if you have to pay 90 percent of your salary in federal taxes that means you will get 20 at the end of the day and the federal government will get 180 that simply is not the right thing to do but that is what our children and our grandchildren face and what they faced if we did not dare to stand up to say no to more and more spending what do we hear now 4 years later just 4 years later we have gotten to a point where we could not only erase the deficit but also erase the 5 4 trillion debt just in 10 or 15 years how did this come about we hear an awful lot about the recovery a lot of people want to take credit but i remember back in 1995 when we got here we said we are going to balance the budget and we are going to do it in 7 years or less i actually voted on a plan that would balance the budget in 5 years they called us radical and extreme because their views were radical and extreme i guess to a political faction that had spent 40 years borrowing from their children and their grandchildren and stealing from their grandparents social security trust fund i guess our concept was radical this was our concept if you spend 1 then you had better bring in 1 stop borrowing from the next generation and from the generation that survived the depression and won world war ii instead let us be fiscally responsible so we brought out a plan to balance the budget it was the plan of the gentleman from ohio it was a courageous plan i got up here in my first couple of months in washington and everybody in washington told me we cannot do it this will never happen we cannot balance the budget in fact i remember the president coming out and saying if we tried to balance the budget in 7 years we would destroy the american economy the president of the united states just 4 years ago said if we tried to balance the budget in 7 years we would destroy the united states economy we had some other people that knew a thing or two about economics come and testify before congress the gentleman from ohio chairman kasich had fed chairman alan greenspan come to congress the chairman of the fed said if you people will only do what you say you want to do and pass a budget that will balance in 7 years you will see unprecedented economic growth you will see interest rates rocket down you will see unemployment go down you will see the stock market explode you will see america explode economically in a way that it had not exploded since the end of world war ii do members know what he was right his prediction before the committee on the budget in early 1995 was deadly accurate it is a good thing that we listened to our hearts that we listened to the chaiiman of the fed and ignored the naysayers on the radical left and ignored the president who said do not balance the budget it is a very bad thing facts are stubborn things it was only 1 year later when he was running for president that he said his first priority would be to keep up the fight for balancing the budget it is very interesting because he vetoed nine appropriation bills he shut down the government all because he did not want to balance the budget in 7 years he said it would destroy the economy what has our work accomplished what has the work of the gentleman from ohio chairman kasich accomplished what has speaker gingrich when he was still here as a speaker accomplished what has the courage of republicans and conservative democrats alike accomplished well let us look at it when we first got here 4 years ago the deficit was approaching 300 billion now we are told that the budget will balance in the next year when we first got here the dow jones was at 3 900 today it is at 9 500 and middle class americans have gotten involved in the market in their 401 k plans and america is enjoying unprecedented economic growth unemployment is down inflation has remained down america has not enjoyed better times why all because we ignored the naysayers and the people who said we cannot balance our checkbooks we cannot run washington the way middleclass americans have to run their homes we cannot do it we said we can do it mr president and we will do it mr president and because we did america enjoys unprecedented economic growth it is time for us to step back not to assess credit not to assess blame but just to say let us remember the facts and let us remember what got us here the gentleman from ohio chairman kasich was for it the speaker was for it every republican was for it a few democrats were for it the president was against it and the radical left was against it 0 1515 it is a good thing a good thing that we stuck to our plan but yet to hear the administration talk one would think my gosh this was our plan all along it was not it just was not and i suppose they can say it as much as they want to say it they can take the credit as much as they want to take the credit but facts are stubborn things so what we have to do in 1999 is remember the lessons of 1995 just because it is unpopular does not mean it is not the right thing to do just because less government may not be popular in washington d c does not mean it is not the right thing to do just because destroying the death tax cutting capital gains tax ending the marriage penalty and allowing people that make from 45 000 to 60 000 to pay less taxes just because it may be tough does not mean it is not the right thing to do it is the right thing to do it may seem radical to people whose entire life their entire existence is based in washington d c who believe that all roads lead to washington who believe that washington knows how to spend out money better than we know how to spend our money that believe washington knows how to educate our children more than we know how to educate our children that believe that washington knows how to clean up crime better than communities know how to clean up crime it may seem radical to them but it does not seem radical to me it did not seem radical to ronald reagan and it certainly did not seem radical to thomas jefferson we have to stop turning our backs on what made america so great that is the individual it is people gop in the past has stood for grand old party i think that is a lousy name i think that is a stupid lousy name what we ought to say is gop stands for government of the people now why do i say that because think about it who is the one who is the party that is saying parents and teachers know more about educating children than the federal department of education certainly not democrats they believe that the federal bureaacracy in education should continue to grow and the president has budgets to prove it who believes americans should keep more of their money and washington should take less it is not the democrats of the radical left in fact the president of the united states went up to buffalo a few weeks ago and made a statement that i am sure he wishes he could retract now this is a statement that unfortunately reveals his heart when it comes to washington d c he said to this group about cutting taxes he criticized republicans because they actually wanted americans to keep more of their money and he said you know we in washington could let you keep more of your money and hope you know how to spend it right oh we cannot do that hope what is there to hope about i mean it is so painfully obvious that americans know how to spend their money better than washington d c i will guarantee that if i went to the president of the united states today and i said mr president i have got 50 million for you and you can either have a bureaucrat in washington d c invest that money or you can invest that money yourself i will guarantee that he will say i will invest it myself let us say that someone won a 50 million lottery across america and they said they want to give all of their money away to charity they want to help people if i gave them the option would they rather give that 50 million to federal bureaucracies or would they rather give that 50 million to private charities i will guarantee that they would give it to private charities in a second because washington d c does not have all the answers washington d c cannot do it as well as communities all roads do not lead to washington d c i still believe in the genius of america i still believe in the genius of communities and as the father of two boys in public schools i still believe parents know how to raise their children and teach their children better than bureaucrats in the federal department of education maybe that is not in vogue in 1999 maybe it is not in vogue to say that americans are paying too much in taxes in 1999 maybe the economy is doing so well that americans want to give the federal government more money well i hope not because i do not think that is good for america and i do not think it is good for the federal government because if we give the federal government one dollar they will figure out a way to need two dollars next year if we give them two they will need four if we hire one employee this year they will figure out a way that they will need to hire two next year we have got to get back to basics not only in this congress not only in this country but in this party the party of lincoln the party of madison and jefferson the party that believes that the genius of america lies in the heart of america and not in washington d c so hopefully when we talk about social security we can keep our word with the american people we can stop stealing from social security we can stop the presidents plan dead in its track to loot the social security trust fund of 270 billion 270 billion we can stop the presidents plan to spend more and more money and yes we can stop the presidents plan to raise taxes by almost 100 billion this year we have tried that before that is the past that is the history i know his poll ratings are high and every time they are high he comes to congress and he wants to spend more money and raise more taxes it happened in 1993 we had the largest tax increase in the history of the world that is why i think i got elected in 1994 because of his tax increase in 1993 i was against it then i am against it now i think it is immoral for the federal government to take half of what anlericans earn when we look at it look at it and see a great example is the death tax now the radical left will tell us that the death tax is about nothing more than helping the rich say that to the farmer that has spent his entire life with his hands in the soil building a farm praying to god every year that his crops will come in praying that he will have something to pass on to his sons and his daughter only to pass away and have his children have to pay 55 percent to the federal government just because he had the bad fortune of dying fiftyfive percent on money that he has already paid taxes on eight or nine times that is obscene with the new collection of wealth in america with middleclass americans that are actually getting to earn a little bit of money and investing in small businesses and using their hands and using their minds and sweating day and night to build a small business in the hope of passing the american dream on to their children they find out that when they die they are going to have to pay 55 percent to the federal government and what is going to happen to their small business what is going to happen to their small farm they are going to have to sell it they are going to have to have a sale on the courtroom steps because their children are not going to have the money to pay death taxes and keep that family business or that family farm running it makes no sense it makes no sense that americans while they are alive spend half of the year paying for taxes fees and regulations put on them by the government now what does that mean that means that when americans wake up to work on monday they are working for the government and all day they are working for the government when they wake up and go to work on tuesday they are still working to pay taxes fees and regulations to the government it is not until they come back from lunch on wednesday afternoon that they are able to put aside a few dollars for themselves and a few dollars aside for their family and a few dollars aside for a mortgage god help us all to be able to save a little bit of money for our childrens education see this is not the agenda that the president or the radical left want to talk about because what does this do why is this offensive to people on the left because it makes sense it makes sense i think to most americans but why is it offensive to people on the left it is because it takes money out of washington d c and returns it to americans i think in the end the difference between the right and the left is that the left just does not trust americans with their own mpney like the president of the united states said in buffalo a few weeks ago yeah we could give you your money and hope that you spend it the right way but we just cannot do that i am hoping that we will be coming to a time in the coming months that we can debate the real issues and debate the real facts if we are talking about spending we will keep spending down we will adhere to the spending caps that we passed in we have had speaker hastert and several others come out this week and talk about their desire to stay in the spending caps we have had the president of the united states talk about more taxes more spending more government two very separate visions of america republicans are fighting hard to cut taxes hopefully we can cut the death tax hopefully we can help americans that make 45 000 to 60 000 get out of the 28 percent tax bracket and go to the 15 percent tax bracket why is an american making 45 000 paying 28 percent in federal taxes that is insane and wrong the federal government has enough money it does not need money that badly hopefully when we talk about social security we can say no to raiding the social security trust fund and say yes to keeping social security off budget say no to the presidents plan of looting social security by 270 billion according to cbo and say yes to the herger plan the republican plan to keep social security off budget if we do that and if we go back to what we were talking about doing in 1995 which was balancing the budget cutting taxes cutting spending saving social security and being responsible with taxpayers money then i think we will really be on to something and we will go into the next century and the new millennium a stronger freer prouder country than we have in many many years that is my hope that is my prayer and that is what i will be fighting for"], [0.0065920352935791016,

crime we instructed the local governments to hire more police officers and it worked when we passed a water resources bill in this house we did not go to the local elected officials and say which flooding problems or drainage problems do you have figure out how to solve them and here is some money we say build this dam or dredge this river or solve a certain problem we should not substitute

the reason for that is it overturns what is in essence a hundred years of practices in public land management the issue here is whether or not a mine can use more than one 5acre parcel for a millsite and as a matter of fact both the blm and forest service manuals say yes the blm manual says quote a millsite cannot exceed 5 acres in size there is no limit to the number of millsites that can be held by a single claimant the blm handbook for mineral examiners says quote each millsite is limited to a maximum of 5 acres in size and must be located on nonmineral land millsites may be located by legal subdivision or by metes and bounds any number of millsites may be located but each must be used in connection with the mining or milling operation and the unitedstates forest service manual says quote the number of millsites that may legally be located is based specifically on the need for mining or milling purposes irrespective of the types or numbers of mining claims involved this has been the practice for well over a hundred years basically this issue is that the clinton administration has decided it wants to wage war on mining on the public lands the average hard rock mine employs about 300 people more or less in seattle washington or bridgeport connecticut or here in washington d c 300 jobs is not a big deal more than that number of people work in one floor of any of our office buildings but in rural montana it is a big deal we need those jobs and often they are the only jobs in those communities the president just toured rural america and talked about the high poverty rate and the high unemployment rate that is out there we need these jobs our communities need these jobs our families need these jobs our schools need these jobs i think the 1872 mining law needs to be updated it has been four or five dozen times and i would support an effort to try to do that but that reform is the responsibility of congress it is not the responsibility of one lawyer in the administration and it should not be done by executive fiat the clintongore new interpretation of this provision is done without any court oversight it has been done without any public input it has
