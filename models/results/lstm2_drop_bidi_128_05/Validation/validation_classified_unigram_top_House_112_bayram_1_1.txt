been debased to an extent that i certainly have not seen in this body prior under either party lets talk about exactly what was attempted yesterday in this constitutional amendment that would have essentially passed as part of a resolution its one thing to say that we want to eliminate medicare the house worked its will through the ryan budget phasing out medicare for those who are under 55 years of age the people of this country will have the opportunity to change that we saw an election in upstate new york where i think and most people think that the people of this country soundly rejected the effort to eliminate medicare but regardless thats what elections are about i know that in the last election democrats didnt fare too well a majority of this house was elected that wanted to phase out medicare for people under the age of 55 likewise in the next election if people run on that a majority might arise in this body that supports keeping medicare solvent for the next generation what was attempted yesterday was circumventing the public will by inserting into the united states constitution exact fiscal policy that essentially wouldnt allow medicare to exist in any form similar to what it is today it would actually specify an exact percentage of the gross national product that the public sector can contain in our governing document this is unprecedented who hears of putting numbers 19 7 percent 19 5 percent 20 21 percentwere talking about the percentage of the economy that can be public sector versus private sector who knows what the ideal percentage is

said this is such an absurd concept imagine for a minute that there was a democratic majority and we were saying you know what we want to put in our constitution that public expenditures have to be at

we reauthorizing subsidies for large corporations i hope that my colleagues who criticize welfare for the poor on moral and constitutional grounds will vote against this program that provides welfare for the rich proponents of continued american support for exim claim that the bank creates jobs and promotes economic growth however this claim rests on a version of what the great economist henry hazlitt called the broken window fallacy when a hoodlum throws a rock through a store window it can be said he has contributed to the economy as the store owner will have to spend money having the window fixed the benefits to those who repaired the window are visible for all to see therefore it is easy to see the broken window as economically beneficial however the benefits of the broken window are revealed as an illusion when one takes into account what is not seen the businesses and workers who would have benefited had the store owner not spent money repairing a window but rather been free to spend his money as he chose similarly the beneficiaries of exim are visible to all what is not seen is the products that would have been built the businesses that would have been started and the jobs that would have been created had the funds used for exim been left in the hands of consumers leaving those funds in the private sector ensures that those resources will be put to the use most highly valued by individual consumers in contrast when the government diverts resources into the public sector via programs such as exim their use is determined by bureaucrats and politically powerful special interests resulting in a distorted market and a misallocation of resources by distorting the market and preventing resources from achieving their highest valued use exim actually costs americans jobs and reduces americas standard of living finally i would like to remind my colleagues that there is simply no constitutional justification for the expenditure of funds on programs such as exim in fact the framers of the constitution would be horrified to know that the federal government was taking hardearned money from the american people in order to benefit the politically powerful

2012 amends an existing program within the justice department that administers benefits to certain public safety officers killed or disabled in the line of duty i commend representative michael fitzpatrick for his leadership on this issue and am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation the bill makes changes to the class of beneficiaries as well as some commonsense costsaving reforms to the program congress originally passed the public safety officers benefits act psob in 1976 this program evolved from concern that state and local public safety officers and their families were not being provided with adequate death benefits and that the low level of benefits might impede recruitment efforts and impair morale originally the psob program provided only death benefits to the survivors of officers killed in the line of duty it was later expanded to provide benefits to officers disabled in the line of duty and education benefits to the spouses and children of officers killed or disabled in the line of duty congress has amended the psob program many times since its inception some of the changes have resulted in inconsistencies within the law or have unintentionally resulted in a delay in the psob benefit process for example each psob claimant must be examined by an impartial medical examiner who then advises the justice department regarding their decision to award benefits but the psob statute and its regulations require that the medical examiner be hired from the city where the officer was killed or injured this causes significant delays and adds expense in processing psob claims and in administering the overall program the department spends significant time and resources to find a medical professional who is familiar with the psob program and its requirements that medical professional must also be available and agree to perform the necessary medical exam this process can take weeks if not months to complete this bill provides a solution to this inefficiency it allows the department to develop and draw from a pool of trusted qualified medical professionals to perform the necessary examinations across the country this is similar to how the psob program authorizes their hearing examiners this simple change saves valuable time and taxpayer dollars it also ensures that the public safety officers and their families receive these muchneeded benefits more quickly h r 4018 also clarifies who are eligible beneficiaries when an officer is killed in the line of duty currently the payment of benefits is often postponed sometimes for years while the issue of who is the proper beneficiary is litigated this bill creates a new category of beneficiaries adult children of deceased public safety officers to clarify eligible beneficiaries in certain cases where there are none these cases include when a public safety officers children are all adults there is no surviving spouse no applicable designation of beneficiary is

gas pump with the national average price for gasoline up at around 3 75 per gallon representing an increase of about 40 cents from a year ago and about 20 cents from just 1 month ago citizens are suffering and they need relief it is important to point out in this context that when president obama took office gas prices were at about 1 85 per gallon now that they are up to about 3 75 per gallon we can see a steady increase over this 38month period of time of his presidency so far gasoline prices have risen an average of about 5 cents per gallon per month this is staggering when we think about the fact that if he is reelectedif he serves out the rest of this term and if he is reelectedthat is a total of an additional 58 months with that increase gas prices will be up at around 6 60 per gallon this is a lot of money it is staggering it affects everything we dofrom the miles we drive to the products we buy at the grocery store everything gets more expensive when the fuel we use to transport ourselves and our products becomes more expensive now to some extent one could suggest this was not only foreseeable but it was actually foreseen to some it was considered a desired outcome lets consider for example that in 2008 dr steven chu who now serves as president obamas energy secretary said somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in europe well mr chu it looks as though we are headed in that direction and if we continue to follow this administrations energy policies we may get there as a member of the senates energy and natural resources committee i was somewhat surprised when a suggestion was made just a few days ago that there are some who believe there is no relationship between unitedstates production of petroleum and the price of gasoline in the united states that simply is not true and it cannot be true with oil being the input ingredient into gasoline it is the precursor for gasoline anytime we do anything that cuts off or restricts or limits the supply that is necessarily going to have an impact on the price and it does the fact that it is indisputable that there are other factors which also influence the price of gasoline makes it no less true that we have to produce petroleum at home in addition to buying it from other places in order to keep gasoline prices at reasonable levels we have to produce more there are some things we can do in order to help improve that trend for example we could open anwr for drilling we could open our countrys vast federal public lands to development of oil shale it is a little known fact that in three rocky mountain states a small segment of rocky mountain statesutah colorado and wyomingwe have an estimated 1 2 trillion barrels of proven recoverable oil reserves locked up in oil shale now 1 2 trillion barrels is a lot of oil that is comparable to the combined petroleum reserves of the top 10 petroleumproducing countries of the world combinedjust in one segment of three rocky mountain states yet we are not producing it commercially in part to a very significant degree because that oil shaleespecially in my state the state of utahis overwhelmingly on federal public land and it is almost impossible to get to it to produce it commercially on federally owned public land we need to change that we need to create a sensible environmental review process for oil and gas production generally we need to improve the permitting process for offshore development in the gulf of mexico and in other areas we need to allow the states to regulate hydraulic fracturing without the fear of suffocating and duplicative federal regulations we need to keep all the federal lands in the west open to all kinds of energy development and of course we need the president to approve the keystone xl pipeline this will contribute substantially to americas energy security and will provide an estimated 20 000 shovelready jobs right off the bat there are things we

manufacturing manufacturing drives innovation by conducting twothirds of all research and development and creating the bulk of technology in our nation and nearly 70 percent of all exported goods from

that the veterans administration continues to have the resources it needs to find innovative new medicines and enhanced diagnostics for what can truly be termed an epidemic the amendment does not increase or decrease any accounts in the appropriations bill it simply requires that no fewer than 35 million of the medical and prosthetic research account go towards posttraumatic stress disorder

people could just read the cut cap and balance legislation that they would understand how profoundly reasonable it really is all it really says is that we are going to cut our budget at least as much as we raise the debt ceiling and that were going to put some steps in place to begin to rein in the spending of this government in a real way and that as we go forward we will begin to index the

senator and then finally this legislation says that we need a balanced budget amendment to our constitution i have the privilege of being the chairman of the subcommittee on the constitution in this

joshie and gracie and they have piggy banks they know that if they take more out of it than they put in it then it goes empty they understand that i dont know why something so fundamental and basic escapes the erudite minds that pervade government but it seems that we think that somehow because we have ph d s and that because we are able to perpetrate monotonic polysyllabic obfuscation semantic gymnastics and verbal circumlocution that people wont know what were talking about and that somehow we can get away with anything that we want to and i just think thats so tragic because a reality is still in place that says that if we live outside our means that pretty soon the entire system begins to collapse thats where we are we are seeing people losing confidence in their government and im very concerned about that because i believe that it is vital that people have confidence somebody said to me they said you know if all of the gold in fort knox were stolen tonight and none of us knew about it that the gold market wouldnt change much tomorrow morning in the wall street journal but if someone put out a press release say from fort knox that all of the gold had been stolen in fort knox but that that wasnt really true that all of the gold was still there but somehow the public believed that it had been stolen that gold markets across the planet the next day would crash because peoples perception their confidence in the system is vital to the system right now people are losing confidence in our system and i think there are very few things that threaten us more we talk about a default well the default is not going to happen on august 2 unless the president chooses to arbitrarily force that to happen but i am concerned that the markets may begin to say maybe the congress of the united states just doesnt have the courage to do the right thing maybe somehow theyre going to let politics intervene to the extent that theyre actually going to step back and not do whats necessary to stabilize the economic foundation of this nation and that is so tragic because it doesnt have to be that way this cut cap and balance bill can accomplish everything thats reasonable it can say okay we recognize the challenges that we face in this country today we recognize that weve overspent we recognize that our country is at a low economically we recognize that were not working on full employment we recognize that the markets dont know whether to jump or go blind they dont know what this president is going to do next and if we put this cut cap and balance bill in place all of a sudden the markets of the world the person on the street theyre going to realize hey maybe there is hope after all maybe america is going to go forward and do what she was destined to do from the

place that all too soon we will step from these chambers one by one and that our time here will be passed and only those things that we did that truly honored our god and our country and our fellow human beings and the great gift that weve been given in america will really matter at that point i hope we will realize that we wont have too many votes like this in our career that can make a difference for future generations its been said that the politician looks to the next election whereas the statesman looks to the next generation and that great societies finally come when old men plant trees under whose shade they will never sit i hope tomorrow that we will embrace this thing called statesmanship and look to the next generation and quite frankly to look to the next few days and weeks because what we do is going to send a message to the markets the world over if you are an investor and you saw a company that continued to deficit spend and continued to get in debt beyond its means and continued to carelessly spend would you invest in that company i think thats what our country has to ask ourselves i truly believe that were going to have a chance tomorrow that may be very unique in our careers and its possible that a lot of people are going to succumb to the need to be popular among certain special interest groups but i will just suggest to them that popularity is historys pocket change its courage that is the true currency of history and we have a chance to be courageous tomorrow we have a chance to do whats right to stabilize this country today and tomorrow we have a chance to make sure that our future generations walk in the light of freedom i have a chance as a father to do what i believe is truly right for my children and their contemporaries so that they might grow up and walk in the light of freedom as i have if we do this i believe the people will applaud us in the long run there may be certain exceptions in the short term but in the long run they will look back and say that those people who stood up and did what was right that day when they voted on cut cap and balance and voted for the balanced budget amendment theyll look back and see that as a historic turning point in this country and i want so much to see that happen finally i would just say to you again that all budgets do balance and the equation before us today is are we going to balance the budget or is reality going to balance it in a horrifying way for us for the sake of my children for the sake of future generations and for the sake of all that we love and hold dear in this country and for the sake of making sure that we are good stewards of the greatest nation god has ever given to this planet i hope we do the right thing tomorrow i yield the remainder of the time to the gentleman from indiana"], [0.028171896934509277, 0.5281718969345093, 1, "youre talking about real patriotism youre talking about real american patriotism the great strength of this nation first of all our compassion for each other that were willing to sacrifice today so that you can rebuild in the northeast the northeast has done that or all of america has done that many many times for california because it seems to have more than its share of disasters but across this nation this year weve seen natural disaster after natural disaster occur with billions of dollars of loss as americans it is our patriotic duty it is our community to reach out to help rebuild as we rebuild if we keep in mind these seven principles of the make it in america agenda well not only put people back on their feet but we will strengthen the american economy you mentioned that lock that was taken out the historic nature of it its been rebuilt i saw the picture its a modern piece of equipment but if that equipment is made in america its not only going to help the economy and your community once it gets back into place and the commerce that results from it is restarted but it will also mean jobs for steelworkers who are making the steel the fabricators who are building the lock the engineers and even the regulators that are making sure the lock goes in in a safe and appropriate way those are all american jobs so part of the rebuilding of america is the make it in america so that americans can make it once again"]]}
