of health care cost inflation at a time when americans already spend 287 billion annually or nearly 10 percent of the gnp on health care the luken amendment would be a burden on the federal budget driving up further the cost of medicare and medicaid most ironically the luken amendment would not be in the longrun interests of the professions themselves which would be tarred in the public eye as seeking a special status above the law the arguments advanced by the proponents of the exemption amendment are without merit the proponents say that protection of competition and of consumers raise issues of quality of service which are best left to the states this is a false issue the house should be aware that the vast majority of ftc enforcement activity has nothing whatever to do with the prerogatives of the states it is focused on private law breaking including price fixing boycotts and coercion what about the limited area where state laws are involved the states do not agree an exemption is desirable in a resolution adopted by the chief law enforcement officers of the states the national association of attorneys general opposed any reduction in ftc jurisdiction over the professions the proponents of an exemption also contend that the professions are different from other businesses because they deal with quality issues that the ftc cannot evaluate but the ftc has not pursued such matters it has dealt with garden variety commercial practices like price fixing and boycotts which no one should be permitted to engage in and which do not raise genuine quality issues for example the ftc has challenged physicians attempting to boycott health maintenance organizations it has attacked efforts to fix fees through boycotts of blue cross it has helped bring down the price of eye glasses and saved consumers millions by challenging restraints on advertising of eye wear and it has challenged deceptive advertising by health providers it is unthinkable that the public should be left unprotected against such practices it is offensive that some professional organizations should be fighting to shelter themselves from scrutiny for such conduct and yet it is this kind of enforcement that has unleashed a display of raw lobbying such as we have not seen in this town for a long time todays professional services simply bulk too large and the stakes in terms of equitable access are simply too high to permit removal of the means of maintaining public accountability we simply cannot enact a statute that makes the question of whether a person is subject to the

shortterm approach to the funding problem completely undermines any incentive for congress to exercise the discipline that is required for a responsible budget policy this is certainly a poor way to run the government what we need is stability in government policy particularly with regard to government spending these shortterm solutions only foster uncertainty by imposing false deadlines on

effort on the part of the administration to impose controls on the free flow of information from the government to the public as well as between scientists in the united states and those overseas this is a most ominous development with farreaching implications that i do not believe the administration has fully grasped several actions on the part of the executive add up to a most worrisome picture it has been well publicized that new policies are being implemented which will restrict contacts between government officials and the press in addition a new executive order is being drafted which will give government officials greater authority to invoke national security to keep information from the public through the classification procedure the administration is also moving to rewrite the provisions of the freedom of information act which has served the nation so well since its enactment in 1966 in such a way as to restrict both the material that can be made public and those who may demand the information finally and equally troublesome are the efforts at restricting the flow of scientific information by use of the classification procedure by censorship prior to publication and by means of regulations based on the authority of the arms export and control actadministered by the department of commerceand the international traffic in arms regulationsadministered by the state department admiral inman deputy director of the central intelligence agency produced at the recent annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science a list of subjects for classification or restriction that includes crop forecasting computer software and computer hardware it is not difficult to see the sweeping range of those i roposals in response to criticisms th the national security agency had not made its case for classifying certain cryptographic material admiral inman responded this reasoning is circular and unreasonable the specific details of why information must be protected are often even more damaging than the information itself this justification in itself is a brilliant exercise in circular reasoning it requires that the public place absolute faith and power to control information in the hands of these gentlemen admiral inman then proceeded to characterize scientists arguments for free flow of information as being motivated by selfinterest entirely disregarding the societys stake in this freedom every new administration inevitably goes through a phase of believing it is more important to stem leaks of sensitive or embarrassing material rather than dealing with the substance of the issue while this is understandable we must remain on guard because this administration more than any other stands a good chance of codifying this institutional paranoia into the laws of the land once again we witness the banner of national security being raised to justify all manner of restrictions on the free and necessary flow of information the nation has grown weary of this demagoguery especially when the sweepingly road concept of national interest is freely used in place of national security this nation was founded by individuals who had a healthy distrust for government based not on ideology but on personal experience of its excesses in consequence every effort was made to define rights responsibilities and individual restrictions by means of statutes enacted by congress so as not to fall victim to the capricious interpretations by faceless bureaucrats or officials with narrow perspectiver of the democratic process i believe this is not in contradiction with the present administrations philosophy national security is too important to be left to security specialists alone congress and the executive should be especially careful with language in this area spelling out clearly what is meant by national security they must recognize explicitly that information which is merely embarrassing to government officials does not qualify for being suppressed under the rubric of national security or even national interest quite the contrary such information is properly a part of the public domain for without it the constitutionally mandated system of checks and balances becomes inoperative the oversight function of congress was instituted precisely to deal with competing interests conflicts of policy inefficiency waste and mismanagement restrictions on the public dissemination of governmental information inevitably translates into congiessional ignorance on key matters lor it is well known that congress functions by reacting to public concerns not by initiating public debate for congress to acquiesce to the executives efforts in restricting information is to abdicate its constitutional role beyond the petty issues of embarassing revelations lies the larger question of striking an appropriate balance between the publics rightand needto know and genuine concern for national security matters this is a valid and difficult question precisely because of this it is imperative that the public through it5 elected representatives participate in the process of deciding what it chooses not to know for the sake of the good of the nation as a whole unfortunately this administration has failed to recognize the fact that the publics need to know is fundamental to the workings of a democratic nation and that the press is the sehicle by which this right is exercised the executive appears to view the press as yet another selfserving special interest group and the publics need to know as merely a manifestation of an inappropriate curiosity through its actions regarding revisions of the freedom of information act the new executive order on classification of sensitive material its restrictions on contacts with the press and regulations that restrict communication within the scientific community the administration is effectively shifting the burden of proof of need to know to the end user on a casebycase basis while at the same time eliminating some of the vehicles by which the user might establish such need this in itself is prima fade evidence that the administration does not accept the publics need to know as a right this contradictory situation is further aggravated by the fact that if the public is not aware of the existence of certain important information it will not know to ask for it through the remaining channels fortunately the administrations moves toward information control have met with unprecedented resistance the washington post of january 22 1982 reports vocal protests to the national security adviser by reporters who cover the state department indicating that the change in policy is having chilling effects with officials now reluctant to discuss or even explain basic points of policy universities find themselves in open confrontation with the government refusing to abide by its restrictive regulations regarding meetings with foreign scientistslos angeles times january 20 1982 the otherwise staid national academy of sciences has refused to act as an intermediary between the universities and the state department because it would reflect acceptance of its restrictive policieswashington post january 21 1982 the governing council of the american association for the advancement of science the nations most prestigious scientific society passed a resolution on january 7 1982 disapproving of the governments policies whereas freedom and national security are best preserved by adherence to the principles of openness that are a fundamental tenet of both the american society and of the scientific process be it resolved that the american association for the advancement of science opposes governmental restrictions on the dissemination exchange or availability of unclassified knowledge professional and academic journals are filled with editorials strongly opposing attempts to restrict the flow of scientific information i wish to call to the attention of my colleagues three such statements one by prof edward gerjouy from the university of pittsburgh who chairs the panel on public affairs of the american physical society another by prof stephen unger from columbia university and an excellent editorial by daniel s greenberg the editor and publisher of the washington based science government report editorials appended there is another aspect of this question that must not be forgotten the united states leadership in the field of communications and data processing the united states has held long standing bipartisan policies aimed at facilitating and preventing restrictions on transnational data flows which are very important to international trade and to the functioning of many unitedstates firms that operate overseas we have argued strenuously for the benefits of unrestricted data flow and against the imposition of restrictions on communications such as through the new world information order the administrations actions regarding the flow of information leaving the united states are in direct contradiction to these long standing policies and invite retaliation from other nations which could severely cripple unitedstates leadership trade position as well as intelligence gathering ability for these reasons it is imperative that congress not deal with each of the administrations actions in a piecemeal fashion but be aware of the overall picture they represent if we were on a war footing perhaps the measures proposed by the administration might be justifiable for a short interval but we arenot and the damage and costs that will have to be borne if we accede to the kinds of restrictions envisioned will be farreaching it is ironic that in the

to serve local traffic although the federal highway administration has approved this action the projects eligibility for federal bridge funds has been questioned because of the distance between the

last years appropriations level at that time it was made clear that such an increase was modest indeed given the epas new responsibilities with regard to toxic wastes and given the magnitude of the cuts in epas budget between 1981 and 1982 if we want to reaffirm the commitment we made 1 month ago to the epa budget and environmental protection we must vote today to bring the appropriations for epas research closer to the fiscal year 1982 appropriations level when we debated this issue previously i think we made obvious a contradiction in epa research policy on the one hand the agency is committed to improving the quality of scientific research that it uses to support our environmental standards that is a goal that all of us can enthusiastically endorse at the same time however the agency is cutting exactly those longterm research projects that keep the epa in the forefront of environmental science the point is obvious if the agency is going to focus its entire environmental program on shortterm regulatory needs the quality of its science will inevitably deteriorate that point has been underscored by the american chemical society which represents 125 000 chemists and engineers and which has enthusiastically endorsed the amendment to restore appropriations for epa research let me quote directly from the societys letter the scheuer amendment would increase funding for extramural research an area slated for drastic cuts by administration thereby allowing the agency to draw upon qualified creative experts outside epa who can assist in solving environmental problems the extramural program is critical because it is open to the entire scientific community including many of the best environmental scientists some of whom have become discouraged by their inability to have their work supported by funding through the epa laboratories the proposed additional funds will allow epa to increase its longrange research on emerging environmental problems it would be shortsighted to wait until such problems reach crisis proportions before attempting to develop the information that is needed for appropriate policies and regulations a lack of fundamental

framework under which in the federal government may purhels chase and use ethanol blend fuels in its vehicles the executive order um statesthat whenever feasible federal es agencies shall in procuring unleaded per gasoline motor fuel demonstrate a to preference for the purchase of gasoion hol the order further provides that re the secretary of defense with respect e of to gasohol use by the department of and defense and the administrator of sed general services with respect to gasohol use by other agencies shall issue ag such guidelines for the implementased tion of this order as they deem approirm priate the committee urges the secord retary of agriculture to use the man dm date provided in executive order blue 12261 to facilitate the exercise of the re authority granted in h r 6142 in es making available to federal agencies 3 3 the liquid fuels processed from stocks 3cal of commodity credit corporation amn it is rather unusual fir iuc a single piece of legislation to jeal lue with the range of problems which ple h r 6142 addressesand at ainimal cost to the government i en~huslastitry cally urge my colleagues to support ef the bill with their votes ed i yield 2 minutes to the ds author of the legislation the gentleing man from iowa iin mr bedell asked and was given 2 5 permission to revise and extend his re1 7 marks and to include extraneous orn matter ein mr bedell first i ten would like to thank the chairman of ve the committee and particularly i on extend my thanks to my colleague the gentleman from illinois ent the coauthor of this legislation for so the work which he has done on this de legislation oil as has already been explained h r al 6142 as amended would authorize the ket secretary of agirculture to provide for th the processing of commodity credit han corporation stocks of agricultural in commodities into liquid fuels and agriuel cultural commodity byproducts lco the legislation further provides the secretary with discretion to establish the the terms and conditions under which my the corporations stocks are to be of made available for processing by liquid ite fuel producers the liquid fuels prope duced may be made available by the vel corporation to federal agencies either al to help them meet their immediate ces needs for transportation and industriaod al fuels or for storage for later emerbe gency fuel uses in addition the secreion tary is given authority to sell the liquid fuels in commercial markets provided any sale does not disrupt commercial markets for the liquid fuels the measure also instructs the secretary in determining the feasibility of offering corporation stocks of agricultural commodities for processing into liquid fuels and agricultural commodity byproducts to consider the likely cost to the federal government of retaining ownership of the stocks in their original form the impact of excessive supplies of governmentowned stocks in depressing agricultural commodity prices and the value and usefulness of the stbcks as liquid fuels and agricultural commodity byproducts h r 6142 was approved by the committee on agriculture on a unanimous voice vote and enjoys the support of 30 members of the house including the chairman of the subcommittee on fossil and synthetic fuels mr sharp prospects for record grain production and carryover levels increasing acquisitions of grain under the price support activities of the commodity credit corporation a reversal in the long series of yeartoyear increases in u 9 farm exports and the failure of the united states to attain adequate jelfsufficiency in the production of liquid fuels confirm the need for directing a significant portion of unitedstates agricultural production toward fostering the continued growth of the young domestic alcohol fuels industry recent projections by the unitedstates department of agriculture forecast record unitedstates production of major farm commodities including corn 8 32 billion bushels wheat 2 82 billion bushels and soybeans 2 31 billion bushels the 198283 season carryover estimated for corn alone is a record of 2 8 billion bushels which far surpasses historical levels this anticipated production has pressured farm prices to severely depressed levels and sharply increased expected outlays for farm price support programs current price quotations in local markets for 1982 crops of wheat corn and soybeans are well below 3 50 2 and 5 per bushel respectively recently the estimate for projected commodity credit corporation outlays for its price support activities was doubled to nearly 11 billion the expected record crops threaten to tax the grain handling and storage system as never before new storage facilities are being constructed at a rapid pace and the federal government is approving for commercial storage facilities that were once considered substandard and inadequate to miintain grain in proper condition not only are private stocks of grain held on the farm and in commercial elevators accumulating to record levels govbrnment stocks of farm commodities are also building rapidly as producers forfeit to the commodity credit corporation grain used to secure government price support loans by the end of the 198283 marketing year usda projects that cccowned stocks of corn will increase by at least 150 million bushels to nearly 400 million bushels the estimated firstyear cost to ccc of assuming ownership of a bushel of corn is estimated to be at least 0 80 per bushel when commercial storage rates transportation and handling charges forfeited interest on the loan and forgone firstyear interest revenue on the grain in ccc possession are considered in addition given current severe restrictions on cccs authority to return grain under its ownership to commercial markets as well as prospects for continued depressed farm prices in the near term ccc is likely to own this grain at substantial additional cost for some time one of the primary reasons that agriculture finds itself in a depressed state is the deterioration in the farm export outlook the burden of record agricultural surpluses has been compounded by this reduction in the value of unitedstates farm exportsthe first such reduction since 1969 in addition certain commodities are experiencing a reduction in export volume as well as value corn export shipments for example are at a 5year low the dismal prospects for resumed strong growth in unitedstates export markets point to the need for developing additional domestic outlets for our grain production the development of an established alcohol fuels industry offers the potential for creating substantial new domestic demand for grain a goal which if realized could lead to strong and stable prices for american producers a mature alcohol fuels industry could also serve as a model for current efforts to promote the value added production and export for unitedstates goods for example those alcohol producers using the wet milling process can obtain from one 56pound bushel of corn 2 5 gallons of anhydrous ethanol 1 7 pounds of corn oil 3 pounds of corn gluten meal a 60percent protein product 14 5 pounds of corn gluten feed a 21percent protein additive and 15 pounds of highgrade carbon dioxide in addition wetmilling facilities have the flexibility to reduce their ethanol production in favor or producing high fructose corn syrup in a dry milling facility 2 5 gallons of ethanol and nearly 17 pounds of a 26 to 32percent protein material call dried distillers grain ddg remain after the process according to a 1981 study by the unitedstates department of energys office of alcohol fuels based on mid1981 corn prices unitedstates onp would increase by 1 89 for each bushel of corn diverted from the export market to produce ethanol similar studies have projected the increased employment national income and balance of payments benefits that would likely accrue to the united states if a strong alcohol fuels industry were established contrary to the current widely held perception sales of gasoline alcohol blend fuels have not declined in the face of the curent oil glut and period of moderate gasoline prices as the information in the tables below relates alcohol blend fuelscommonly marketed today as super unleaded with ethanol or unleaded plus r ither than gasohol are attaining a steadily

and disabled beneficiaries of the medicare program the vote on this amendment assumes a role of historic importance with this vote the congress will decide whether or not this nation will uphold its commitment to provide a basic minimum level of protection against the catastrophic impact of skyrocketing health care costs the senate has already passed a budget which would cut medicare by 17 5 billion during the next 3 years thus the elderly of america are looking to us at this moment to stand with them and defend the vital services they depend on medicare beneficiaries already experience health care costs which are 2 times greater than those of the rest of the population in fact elderly people already have to pay more out of their own pockets for health care than prior to the enactment of medicare poverty rates for the elderly have increased the last 2 years how can we therefore expect the elderly to empty their pockets when they are fast running out of pockets to empty proposals to cut medicare to balance the budget really propose a sickness levy squeezing the most from those who are the most seriously ill the amendment before us today would protect the elderly from what they fear most increases in the costs of vital medical services the dollar loss from fraud waste and mismanagement that can be ferreted out of the pentagon budget alone would more than offset the costs of the medicare program and retain its vital protections i want to commend my colleague from ohio for offering this amendment i join with her in declaring that this house cannot turn its back and allow the brutal rape of the medicare program i urge the passage of this amendment"]]}
