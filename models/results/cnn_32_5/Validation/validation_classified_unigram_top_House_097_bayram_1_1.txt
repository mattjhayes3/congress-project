the programs and we will not have the same kind of service that we would have had if we expended this rather small amount of money in order to keep the ongoing programs working i would submit that in my state and other states the work of the state energyj offices has been much more effective than almost any other dollar expended on energy programs at the federal level so i am hopeful that thiscommittee will today decide not to kick those states that are down because of the high cost of energy and will decide not to interrupt very important and very worthwhile state energy programs by making a very abrupt and a very unnecessary cut in these funds i hope we will support statebased energy programs by backing this admendment"], [4.4345855712890625e-05, 0.4999556541442871, 0, "i thank

in behalf of every farmer who toils long hours to raise and harvest a crop and then store it in a warehouse this special order is in fact on behalf of the producer who is being victimized in my personal opinion by unfair and unrealistic bankruptcy laws this special order is about the need to reform our federal bankruptcy statute wayne cryts is the victim of a judicial system that is protecting some but not all citizens now legal scholars may disagree that the wayne cryts case represents a threat to a real institution in farm country to date farmers have always put their faith and trust in what is called a warehouse receipt farmers have always believed that a warehouse receipt was as good as the grain in the bin however during the ordeal suffered by wayne cryts in missouri farmers throughout this country are being told that once the grain is deposited in the hands of a warehouse operator it becomes the property of the warehouse operator it is my firm conviction along with thousands of farmers in this nation that the warehouse receipt does not transfer ownership to anyone it merely requires the warehouse operator to store the commodity and return a like product upon demand of the holder of the warehouse receipt if the bad news is that wayne cryts remains incarcerated in a missouri jail the good news has to be that it does focus attention for this body to act on legislation to reform the bankruptcy code to act on the legislation that my friend and colleague has introduced it has been almost 14 months that the house judiciary committee has had bankruptcy

order but it occurred to me last week as the american public was watching the house struggle with our budget crisis and as president reagan after writig for several months for the leadership of this house to respond regarding his proposals for a budget went the extra mile in an effort to compromise only to have that budget compromise fall apart the country was left in a stalemate and in a circumstance that absolutely undermines our ability to turn about our economyand then as the speaker when discussing the matter with the press indicated that the real reason for the stalemate was a fundameltal philosophical difference between himself and president reagan and his administrationit seemed to me it was about time that some of us came before the american public to talk about our problems as they really are as a practical fact of life the american public in the last election finally had had enough of business as usual they rifled a message by way their ballot boxes and told us in the congress that it was time to get off that 25year pattern of spending and spending and more spending and a rate of growth of government that had gotten to the point where literally uncle sam needed to go on a diet the american public told this congress that no longer could we afford to be moving down that path toward more than a trillion dollar national debt we have reached a point where there is a good deal of talk about a 125 billion deficit for a single year the figures range between 90 and 180 billion depending on which statistician is talking the public recognizes the heart of the problem the fact is that just the interest on that national debt costs us nearly that entire 125 billion without the interest on that national debt we would have a balanced budget with president reagans program of last year i think it is about time that the american public join with us and ask this one question if indeed the leadership of this house does not agree with the reagan proposals for the 1983 budget for 1984 and 1985 then they have a grave responsibility to come before all of us and give us a clear picture of their alternative what is their alternative their alternative is very simple it is to once again go back to their business as usual that is more spending at the federal level more taxes and less defense for lack of a better term i thought it would be worthwhile to call that tip onomics for that is their proposal to proceed on the same path that has taken us to the point where we face economic crisis let us go back a bit and take a look at a few of the fact that are a part of recent history it is significant for us to remember that in 1976 when the majority party in this house the democrats led by the same leadership had control of the house of representatives and the senate but not the presidency at that point the interest rate was only 6 35 percent compared to a high 4 years later of almost 21 percent after they controlled both houses and the presidency it is critical for us to understand that when jimmy carter was elected president the consumer price index was at 5 8 percent and it rose ill the way to a high of 13 5 percent at the end of his administration the deficit pattern continued the economy began to go on the rocks and as a result of it the money markets expressed their lack of trust in the kind of leadership we were experiencing in this house that pushed intergst rates to that 21 percent high then there was a change in 1980 the president suggested we begin a modernday revolution he suggested the following steps first of all we must get on a path that would put our economic house in order and the way to begin is to recognize what every american family understands you cannot overspend your income year in and year out without eventually having to pay the piper as a practical fact of life the president recognized that time was running out and the first step that is necessary to turn that corner is to begin to trim back the rate at which government had been growing so president reagan took the jimmy carter proposals for 1982 and trimmed program after program i think it is important for all of us to recognize that in virtually every one of those instances where he was cutting back it was not a matter of cutting the actual dollars spent on those programs the year before it simply reduced the growth on the part of many of those programs that had been around and were exploding to higher levels each fiscal year the reductions were an effort to begin to bring responsibility to our spending patterns now at another level the president suggested that the people were fed up with unnecessary redtape and unnecessary regulation at the national level the president himself imposed absolutely astonishing changes in those agencies where he has direct executive control he eliminated some 3 000 pages of redtape that were unnecessary and represented new regulations the president itterally with his own pencil began to turn the corner on regulatory reform mr and mrs america can tell us if we have not been listening that when they go down to a big government office when they have got a problem too often the person across the desk wants to treat them like a number it is regulation impersonality big government not caring about people but just caring about their own programs the president was saying that it is about time that uncle went on a diet another part of the revolution was to suggest that we actually ought to begin or that we actually could begin going in a direction wherebywe took less and less of the average americans takehome pay for paying the bills of government virtually the president sponsored an economic program that cut tax rates across the board over a 3year period for every american family the point was this historically around congress we have enjoyed just before election time increasing a program here or there giving a new kind of wrinkle to any number of general category aid programs and then we decide even though the benefits are going to be sent out before election time that there is no way to pay for that now the president said nonsense from this point on the federal government is going to have to pay for it first in the past we had gotten used to giving some kind of a tax break just before the election as well it is easy enough to give a tax break say to some industry for instance in depreciation and then the following year after election if you think you do not have enough revenue to go in and eliminate that tax break because there are not too many constituents actually affected the reagan program reduced taxes for 35 million american families and indeed in the future with marginal tax rates in place it is going to be very difficult for democrats or others to increase those taxes again so at this point in time the leadership is attempting to eliminate that income tax break for all americans before it really is felt out there last year there was a little piece of it one and onefourth percent that few could even begin to feel in actual disposable income but they want to eliminate the future before it is in place because they know they will have a revolution on their hands if they try to raise taxes once the people get the tax break in their pockets tip onomics is designed to communicate to the average citizen what the goals of democratic economic policies actually are but we must be willing to ask this question why does this leadership insist upon continuing down the path of business as usual it is simple it is because the leadership of this house believes that every problem must be solved by a new government program or a bigger government program they actually believe it philosophically if you believe that then you probably will be supporting that kind of a pattern of government if you do not believe that then you must recognize this the leadership of the houseand i believe even including the speakerwhile they are very sincere is composed of democrats who are out of contact with the broad cross section of the american public democrats and republicans alike the democrats in my district do not want more government the democrats in my district are convinced that they are taxed enoughif not too much indeed the democrats in my district believe that it is long overdue for america to lead in the world and to lead from a position of strength not to be in a position of having less defense more spending higher taxes less defense that is tip onomics that is business as usual last week the president came before us once again when the compromise fell apart he asked each and every one of us to communicate our concerns to members of the house the reason that that message was most important is because of the reality that all 435 members of this house are running for reelection every 2 years the time to begin to communicate to them about this coming election is right now it is also fundamental to realize that we are in a circumstance at the moment that may very well be the turning in the crossroads as of this moment we are living with the reality that nobody said it was going to be easy when you have been on a path of 40 years of terrible economic policies of overspending of causing our children and grandchildren to be indebted for much of their lifetime it ik not easy to tu rn that around and there is bound to be some pain that is a part of it but just as important on the other side of that is the fact that there are so many things happening out there that will make a difference there is beginning to develop a softening of interest rates in the money markets i personally am convinced that we are just on the edge of pushing those high interest rates down it is basic for americans to realize this we had a high of 21 5 percent and those were the interest rates when president reagan came into office today they are approximately 16 5 percent that is better but not good enough but there is evidence that the pressures are on to begin to move those rates down do my colleagues remember a year ago none of us could hardly talk about another thing besides the inflation rate the best kept secret in the vorld is that inflation is no longer a problem the inflation rate at this point for the first 3 months of this year are running at an annual rate of 1 percent a huge reduction in the inflation as a result of sound economic policies beginning to be put into place above and beyond that it is fundamental for us to realize that there is new money flowing out there in the private marketplace which will provide tremendous opportunities for new investment new productivity and for jobs nobody said it was going to be easy it takes time for those programs to begin to have an impact but next i think it is basic for us to understand that the major roadblock at this moment to allowing those interest rates to really begin to decline is the fact that the money markets and others are waiting for us to demonstrate that we actually are going to come to a compromise that makes sense out of the 1983 budget a compromise that says that we can work together and the democrats and the republicans alike want to move in the direction of making sense out of our budget so in turn our economy can respond it is my view there are at least some of those within the leadership of this house those democrats who are not in touch with the american public the registered voter out there democrat or republican leaders in this house who actually do not want to see a compromise they want to see a stalemate continued because some actually cynically believe that if you leave the economy in chaos then come november that means extra victories for the majority party in this house extra victories that will allow them to continue the kind of control they have had for over 25 years extra victories that will allow them to continue business as usual remember uncle needs a diet and tip onomics means business as usual more government spending more taxes and less defense"], [5.042552947998047e-05, 0.49994957447052, 0, "i thank the gentleman from new york who many of us acknowledge as congress most distinguished member who has offered an important perspective on the leasing provisions of the 1981 tax act as he suggests the leasing provisions were included in the tax package primarily because in their absence the tax bill would have disproportionately benefited companies making a profit although at first glance it seems entirely logical to insure that unprofitable firms can take advantage of the income tax deductions and credits available to profitmaking corporations this bit of sophistry deserves closer scrutiny balling out losing companieshowever indirectlyamounts to a form of corporate welfare rewarding companies for losing money in a capitalist society to like selling indulgences for moral indiscretions in the middle ages it does not work a free enterprise economy is based on incentives and rapid corporate adaptiveness to the market place where noncompetitive practices are insulated from market decisions stultification of the economy is the inevitable result moreover as the leasing provisions were originally conceived the profitable company buying the tax breaks was to play a neutral role with the treasury being the loser and the unprofitable company receiving 90 percent or so of the advantages in practice however profitable firms appear to be getting about half of the advantages the recent ibmford deal provides useful illustration ford which sold its tax breaks for between 100 millionand 200 million received only 20 cents on the dollar ibm on the other hand is expected to make a profit of between 100 million and 200 million on its expenditure of a like amount in addition it should be stressed that acompany need not be unprofitable to take advantage of the leasing provisions as a result of sizable in vestment or foreign tax credits a profitable company may have amore tax benefits than i can apply to domestic earnings and it may offer these for sale thus occidental petroleum which paidno federal income tax

the lopsided advantage given to profitable companies in he ~bartering of tax losses together with the sanctioning of the sale of tax credits by profitable companies make mince meat of the original rationale for the leasing provisions the soleand overwhelminglosers in lthe process are those industries and individuals with~ a stake in a balanced lfederal fiscal policy with treasury losses over the next 5 years now expected to be far greater than the original estimate of 27 billion gossip in wall street is that it is becoming increasingly inex cusable for corporations mwith ingenious treasurers 1o pay taxes at all however ithe happy smiles of wall street treasurers are not reciprocated by the bookkeepers of mwain street en terprises to benefit from these leasing provisions companies apparently must be quite large as the recent scramble to package lease arrangements indicates corporate partners have almost exclusively been companies buying or selling multimilliondollar credits the problems of small business profitable or otherwise are lrelevant to this intricate tax provision what congress has done through this one complicated provision in the tax code is pass a corporate bailout measure 20 to 40 times the magnitude of the chrysler loan guarantee program one profound distinction however exists between the chrysler package and the leasing approach we are talking about today the former implies abailout of alarge corporation in financial difficulty the latter contains a novel precedent congress has approved a bailout for healthy companle3 as well liberals and the democratic party in particular have been discredited in recent elections 4because of an inability to make tough choices on spending policies too frequently the liberal position has been an undisciplined vote for more conservatives and the republican party today are challenged by an fandisciplined approach to tax cutting simply voting more for every tax cutting idea can have equally irresponsible effects on the deficit as simply voting more for every good spending idea now that the republican party has a mandate to govern ithas a responsibility to discipline itself on tax

it is my sincere hope that my colleagues will support it i want to take a few minutes today to talk about one specific matter in the report accompanying this bill in the section of the report describing our committees action on the department of agriculture some language was included regarding the operation of certain pilot school lunch projects by usda this language was offered to enforce the original intent that we had when this project was first funded in fiscal 1981 in summary this pilot project is an attempt to determine if the school lunch program can be run more effectively by giving schools cash or letters of credit in lieu of the commodities that they are currently receiving this is a subject of some disagreement and we felt that it was prudent that the matter be appropriately reviewed before any further legislative action was taken on it under this project 30 school districts will operate as they currently do under the lunch program 30 others will receive all letters of credit in lieu of their normal commodity support and yet another 30 will operate with cash in lieu of the basic commodity support the problem is that usda is acting as if we had given them authority to provide cash or letters of credit for the value of the bonus commodities which is something that we definitely did not do in the report that accompanies the fiscal 1981 supplemental appropriations bill we directed that the department may either withhold charge for or earmark in some fashion the value of bonus commodities which may be received by those school districts this language did not mean that the schools should get extra cash or extra letters of credit it meant that the impact of bonus commodities provided to the schools should be separately accounted for or that the bonus commodities should be withheld entirely the report language provided by our committee reminds the department that it does not have the authority that it claims it does they may give bonus commodities and not a substitute given that the stories of surplus commodities have received great attention in recent weeks we want to see these commodities used in an efficient way we do not want them bottled up in some warehouse where they will rotespecially not when the provision of these commodities to schools can do some good furthermore under the way the school lunch program is supposed to operate bonus commodities are not supposed to be a normal component it is for this reason that we want bonus commodities separately accounted for not transformed into a different medium the department should not treat the bonus commodities as a normal component of the school lunch program and by designing the study in the impermissible way that it has it is acting as if these bonus commodities will always be there the purpose of the study is to determine alternative methods for the lunch program and their respective feasibilities it is for this reason that the study concentrate on the basis of the lunch program and not its collateral components second during the course of our hearings on the fiscal 1983 agricultural appropriations bill assistant secretary mary jarrat testified that the study can be completed in 2 years and by implication for this reason it is not necessary to run this pilot program beyond the end of the study term our report notes this fact and directs the department to not make plans for continuing the project beyond the 198384 school year unless the projects are extended by congress this report language is essential for maintaining the original intent of our 1081 appropriation action the department has yet to provide sufficient justification for the actions in wishes to take in contradiction to the directives provided by our previous action answers to questions that have been submitted to the food and nutrition service by myself and the subcommittee on agricultural appropriations have been nonresponsive and the action of the department has in fact been in contradiction to the recommendations issued by a large number of a departmentalppointed advisory panel which is supposed to oversee this project many of the panel members have become so frustrated with the departments inattentive ear to their concerns that these members doubt whether or not the advisory panel has any real value at this point i am hoping that the house can support the agricultural appropriations subcommittee and the full appropriations committee on this matter in an effort to return to days of responsible decisionmaking we want this study to be a credible one it is for this reason that we believe this report language is so essential and why this report language will continue to be enforced in each of our subsequent agricultural
