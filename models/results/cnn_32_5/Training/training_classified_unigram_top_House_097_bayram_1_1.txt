representatives and the congress is the institution it now is in large measure because of his never ending pursuit of democratic principles and procedures to serve it he has also indeed had an exceptional influence on the development of the democratic party both as a team player on the rules committee and as a student of the congress dick bolling is a man who likes to take on the tough issues the civil rights act of 1964 serves as an early example of this principle many of us now in this chamber were just getting started in politics in those days and it is with great admiration that i recall how truly enormous was the effort it took to enact national legislation of such stature in those days another toughissue was committee reform and the opening of the process to every member sometimes at the expense of those who had already achieved an important position some early chapters on the bolling committee as we call it and its work to modernize the house and bring the work of its several committees into better balance have already been written the committee on science and technology which i am privileged to chair is one of the many beneficiaries of the painstaking efforts led by dick bolling as a result of his efforts the house did give responsibility for civilian research and ievelopment to one committee and thus equipped itself to deal with one of the key issues on our national agenda the role of science and technology and the contributions which can be made by that sector to increased innovation and productivity in addition as a key figure on the rules committee for many years and more recently as its chairman he has been instrumental in seeing that the referral mechanisms put in place by house resolution 988 were properly and fairly adhered to the product of this stewardship has been better legislation and it would not have been possible without dick bolling equally tough to grapple with has been the tying together in the congress of the spending side with the requirement to levy taxes the 1974 budget and improvement control act bears his stamp and is in large measure the product of his foresight since the implementation of the act is still a matter of relative newness the full impact of the goals and procedures it establishes is very much in the center of todays political arena the linkage of spending authority and taxing authority had changed the whole nature of our political debate and given national attention to the very essential work we do here and its impact on our economy dick bolling is a liberal who believes

become the author of the more comprehensive 1960 civil rights act refusing to rest on what many people called remarkable achievements in the area of civil rights emanuel celler through his position as

and wit he led a 2week debate that held together the farthest reaching civil rights bill ever written the measure covered desegregation in education employment public accomodations and other basic aspects of life after the house passed each civil rights bill mr celler went on to tackle the senate judiciary committee which at that time was dominated by southerners who traditionally kept legislation of this kind bottled up in committee in every instance he pressured the senate to pass the bills despite the opposition of some of the senate judiciary committee members and the threat of filibusters and other tactics in addition to his achievements in the area of civil rights legislation mr celler is noted for his work with four constitutional amendments the first amendment allowed the citizens of the district of columbia to vote in presidential elections the second amendment effectively banned the levy of se h 313 poll taxes in federal elections the third was an amendment on

spanned the army navy and marine corps we recommended reduclons totaling 87 million in reviewing these services plans for rotary wing development we found that a comprehensive departmentwide plan does not exist the developments are bogged down in a morass of conflicting requirements and possibly duplicative efforts until a coherent plan is constructed by the department of defense we will continue

optical pointing and tracking development should continue to this end we deleted 121 million from existing programs and added 52 million for the new direction because of the urgent need for accurate naval gunfire articulated by the present and former commandants of the marine corps the committee recommended additional authorization of 117 million for the joint army navy laser guided projectile program and the seafire fire control system previously the congress has specified in public law 9579 that the guided projectile be deployed by january 1980 however the navy without notifying the congress terminated the program in december 1981 the committee recommends a general reduction of 117 million to the fiscal year 1983 navy r d request to accommodate the guided projectile and seafire programs there are some other features of this bill that deserve special attention as you recall last year we included a provision in our bill to permit authorization for multiyear procurement we wereand remainconvinced that multiyear procurement if properly focused can offer significant savings in weapons acquisition the department of defense requested multiyear procurement for the uh60 helicopter and the p16 fighter we approved those requests however there were other multiyear procurement requestsprimarily navythat were supported by too little documentation or that yielded insignificant savings we refused those requests we will continue to encourage service use of multiyear procurement but only when it makes sense with respect to some of the major programs we authorized 4 billion for procurement of the first increment of seven b1b aircraft to replace the aging b51 fleetthe airbreathing leg of our strategic forces these funds support the second year of production of the b1b the committee recommends deletion of 332 million of the departments procurement request of 1 497 billion for the mx missile system this action would defer procurement of spares and defer some work related solely to the temporary basing of the mx in silos but would permit work that is common to both interim and longterm basing modes to proceed the committee strongly supports continuation of the research and development of the mx missile and recommends authorization of 2 6 billion for this purposea reduction of 150 million there is no doubt in our minds that our landbased missile forces must be modernized by the mx system with a survivable basing mode the mx will offer increased accuracy greater hard target kill capability and effective deterrence against the soviet icbms that are now capable of destroying our minuteman missiles in a first attack to improve our airlift capability we recommend authorization of 860 million for procurement of the new c5 aircaft we are convinced that the c5 now a mature and proven design offers the capability and capacity that our forces require overall in procurement the recommendation with the reductions proposed by mr stratton and mrs holt and mr bennem and mr spence is 2 9 billion less than the presidents request of 89 6 billion because of concerns over the readiness of our forces we recommend actions that have the effect of placing a 1year moratorium on contracting out various functions in the department of defense in addition we added 2 million to the request for additional efforts directed toward controlling the illegal flow of militaryrelated technology to the eastern bloc countries this is an extremely important effort as some of the news accounts have recently detailed these are highlights of this bill it is complex and deserves thorough discussion and debate the bipartisan leadership of the committee has as the chairman and i have previously indicated agreed to offer further reductions to this bill as originally reported in april in order to conform the overall levels of authorization to the defense function totals in the budget resolution the reductions were arrived at through joint consultation and by taking into account relative priorities among the authorization categories this was not an easy task because we strongly believe that the authorizations recommended in the reported bill are the minimally acceptable levels needed in order to insure a return to an adequate defense capability within an acceptable time and using resources efficiently but the budget resolution has established a lower target and the proposed amendments would make h r 6030 consistent with that target the committee has acted responsibly and in its best judgment after hundreds of hours of hearings has set priorities for the allocation of scarce defense resourcestailoring those priorities to the will of the congress as incorporated in the budget resolution i would urge my colleagues to resist further cuts to h r 6030 the soviet threat is real and everpresent the stakes in the decisions we make this week are high british air marshall sir john slessor put it succinctly it is customary in democratic countries to deplore expenditure on armaments as conflicting with the requirements of social service there is a tendency to forget that the most important social service a government can do for its people is to keep them alive and free so in summary let me say that we already cut about 3 billion in anticipation of the budget following that we went back after the budget resolution was passed we went back to committee and the various subcommittees and we made an additional cut of approximately 3 billion this puts us more than 6 billion under the original request we have conformed to the will of the house we have done so surgically not with a meatax approach we have done it in consultation with the department of defense we made the cuts where we felt we could best afford to make them with the least harm to our defense establishment we have done the will of the house we reduced according to what the house said the budget should be and as painful as it was to some of us in certain areas we did so in good faith having done so we would ask our colleagues in the house to accept the cuts that we have made and then join with us in resisting any further cuts to the bill because we think it is too low already with that i would ask all of my colleagues to get behind the members of this committee and to do what we feel the president and the people of this country want to come forth with a good solid defense budget which is in the best interests of the people of this country i reserve the balance of my time"], [2.682209014892578e-06, 0.5000026822090149, 0, "i rise in support of the

proposed spending levels i have supported amendments in the subcommittee that will help keep the citys finances solvent and under control in fiscal year an amendment with my support was added to this bill requiring the city to set aside 20 million for accumulated debt retirement in fiscal year 1983 this sum of 20 million is less than the 30 million originally in the citys own debt retirement plan presented to the congress a year ago but it is a step in the right direction of helping the district government meet itsaccumulated deficit of over 300 million in operating funds alone i continue to have serious reservations as to whether the districts budget will end in balance for fiscal year 1982 in my judgment congress should set aside an additional reserve fund of say 20 million or more from a portion of those surplus tax revenues above projections accruing in the fiscal year 1982 to the city to meet the numerous projections of deficits we have received from the districts own auditor as well as from other district and independent officials on the 1982 budget however i do support this bill and will work in conference to improve on the setaside necessary to meet district debts owed and accumulated deficits in operating expenses on another matter i would like to bring to the attention of members that despite our bill and conference report language of last year and numerous inquiries we have made of the city planning director congress still has not received the completed master comprehensive plan for land use and zoning in the nations capital this master plan has been promised at least since 1978 last year congrers mandated that it be completed and presented to the public in fiscal year 1982 we have not yet seen it despite mayor barrys and jim gibsons personal promises to us earlier this year i view this matter very seriously and would urge the mayor to bring forth the comprehensive master plan just as quickly as possible on another matter i commissioned a gao report on the status of voter registration and voting roles this spring with an eye toward potential performance in the september 14 primary elections the gao reported to congress and we in turn to the mayor of the district of columbia that the board of elections and ethics situation was calamitous and that there would be utter chaos at the polls when the district residents came to vote on shortly after the mayor appointed teddy philosophos to the post of director well we all know the results of that day mr philosophos has resigned 20 000 and more votes were challenged on september 14 and over 5 000 allegedly were disqualified many more registrants names have disappeared and the chaos remains as we approach the november elections something simply must be done about this situation in the nations capital with respect to our citizens voting rights at minimum at my suggestion language has been incbrporated in the committee report today requesting a full report to the house within 30 days on the september 14 primary performance by the board of elections and ethics members should scrutinize this report carefully with an eye toward future congressional action if this situation is not cleared up on another matter the subcommittee has agreed to reinsert language continuing current law banning advertising and the playing of lottery and bingo under the districts new legalized gambling law in the federal enclave in the national historic area of old georgetown and advertising on the metro and other public transportation these are areas of federal interest where thousands of our constituents and foreign visitors come to see the district of columbia each year i see a strong and continued federal interest preventing commercial exploitation in the federal and historic areas i would urge members to insist that we continue the current prohibitions my understanding is that the other body will try to lift the current restriction on the advertising of gambling operations in the metro and other public transportation in this years bill i oppose lifting these restrictions and so do my chairman the gentleman from california and the ranking minority member the gentleman from pennsylvania i also oppose the district governments efforts in the guish of a technical correction in the other bodys bill to lift the congressional action of last year limiting the gambling operations in the national historic district of oldgeorgetown i hope my colleagues will support the committee on this compromise that was worked out with the mayor of the district of columbia and with the officials of his office and with the other body in conference last year keeping gambling out of the federal areas and the national historic districts that are visited by so many foreign visitors and so many of the people of this country this is our national capital it is a beautiful and gracious one of all that i have seen the most beautiful and gracious we are very proud of it we ought to do more to protect it to help it grow to restore its promise and the inspiration it provides to all our citizens through the vision and patient practical efforts of a few extraordinary citizens we have seen in recent years the preservation establishment and protection of such national treasures as the c o canal national park the kennedy center and others we ought to be alert to such important matters to protect our national heritage for instance it has come to our attention that a monument and restoration of the francis scott key home is needed and work is underway here right near the key bridge in old georgetown is where francis scott key lived and worked when he made that fateful trip to baltimore witnessed the british bombardment and in the emotion of the moment penned what has become our national anthem how can we fail to protect and memoralize in our national capital such momentous achievement there is nothing in this particular bill on the subject of a memorial to francis scott key his home what is left of it remains razed and unnoticed by most of us i urge imembers to help me take some needed action to rectify this negligence with respect to the francis scott key home and i will work in the subcommittee with others on this particular matter as well other matters on which i have worked in the subcommittee to help bring to the floor in this bill today are the limitations imposed on the use of the 150 000 of additional moneys for promotion of the districts statehood constitution witnesses before our subcommittee testified as to the possibility of misuse of these moneys unless some restrictions were enacted to provide for the necessary balance among proposed expenditures our language in the report provides for copies of the proposed constitution to be distributed and for preparation of a legislative history for the education of the public prior to this novembers vote by the citizens of the district the restrictions imposed by the subcommittee do in no way prejudge or otherwise intervene in the normal order under existing law for action on the proposed constitution by district citizens this was not our subcommittees intention and should not in any way be interpreted as other than a limitation on the use of the 150 000 in the bill another matter i brought to the attention of the subcommittee is discussed on page 32 of the committee report this has to do with the reported shortfall of 14 3 million in the districts required payments to the district retirement board for the payment of pensions to police officers firefighters judges and teachers the board chairman testified before our subcommittee on the accuracy of this projected shortfall of 14 3 million required to eliminate the fiscal year 1981 deficit during house debate on the parris amendment on this subject the house of representatives clearly manifested its opinion that the fiscal year 1981 bill owed by the city should be paid at once i intend to continue working in the housesenate conference to assure full payment to the fund for our teachers police and firefighters pension the congress must recognize that unless prompt action is taken on the projected and actual unfunded pension liability eventually the nations taxpayers will pick up the entire tab on this district of columbia liability or the pensions owed will go unfunded a catastrophe no one desires or will allow with these reservations urge support for this committee bil h r 7144 and pledge additional work on these matters that i have discussed in the conference that is upcoming with thl other body

this house from kentucky a former senator of the united states a former assistant secretary of state aformer national chairman of the republican party and one of the outstanding kentucklans of the 20th century h 6698 co the occasion for these remarks today is so that we who admired him so much in life may now come to eulogize him in death for thruston died last saturday in louisville his native city he was buried there on monday of this week thruston b morton was already a successful businessman and active community leader in louisville when in 1946 his fellow citizens elected him to the house as a member of the famous 80th congress he took his seat here on january 3 1947 two years later i was privileged to join him when the 81st congress came in and i was enriched and honored to have him as a friend until his dying day although we were of opposite political parties thruston was far too big a man to be partisan in his personal relationships we could talk with each other as friends and we did oftenall through his political career and even after he reentered private life in 1969 today my mind returns to those days in the late 1940s and early 1950s when thruston and i served together as young members of the committee on education and labor that was during the chairmanships of john lesinski and graham barden two other young men then serving with us on the committee later went on to carve out notable careers for themselves in other pursuits they were john fitzgerald kennedy and richard milhous nixon those were years of great activity and great controversy on the committee when we wrestled with questions such as whether or not to repeal tafthartley or whether we should enact federal assistance to education and there were many others thruston and i had many discussions about these matters as we tried to determine what was the best thing to do for our home state of kentucky and for the country you get to know a man that way that is the way i came to know and respect the young louisville congressman thruston decided to retire from the house in 1952 even though he knew with some certainty that he could have been reelected in that year of the eisenhower sweep but he devoted full time to his partys campaign in kentucky that year and came within 700 votes to carrying it for the popular generalturnedcandidate as the new administration came to power in 1953 thepresident drafted thruston morton to be assistant secretary of state for legislation it was a wise choice for his three terms in the house had given thruston considerable stature on capitol hill as well as knowledge about and respect for the legislative process i saw him often during those years as he made trips to the hill to explain the presidents foreign policy initiatives and sometimes to soothe the congressional feathers that had been ruffled by the highflying secretary of state mr dulles thruston did his job well and enhanced the high regard in which he was already held by both house and senate in 1956 the leadership of the republican party in kentucky and nationally prevailed upon thruston lto stand for the unitedstates senate it was a year of turmoil in kentucky politics for the great alben barkley had died suddenly that spring and the seat held by senator earle c clements was up that meant two senate seats t6 be filled a divided democratic party nominated former gov lawrence wetherby for the barkleyvacancy and so thruston morton became a senator of the united states among many political friends it was believed that he would be a onetermer and that kentucky would in 1982 revert to its old pattern of electing democrats to the senate but he stood for reelection in 1962 opposing the able wilson w wyatt his fellow loulavillian a former mayor of that city and the incumbent lieutenant governor of kentucky it was a hardfought campaign between two good friends but even though thrustons old friend and former colleague on the committee on education and labor john kennedy came to kentucky to campaign for the democratic candidate wyatt it was thruston who carried the 7day that he could be fiercely partisan on issues and in matters of political philosophy is evidenced by the fact that his party turned to him for leadership as its national chairman from 1959 to 1961 but surely no democrat would ever say that thruston morton denied him civility or even friendship on the ground of politics this happy faculty to be decent and courteous and always reasonable is what endeared him to his fellow kentucklans they never denied him election to any office he sought a wealthy yaleeducated almost pa trician man in manner and dress thruston morton struck a chord with the people of the farms and small towns of rural kentucky just as he did with people in the larger cities during the 1962 senate campaign a kentucky reporter at one of the morton rallies in an isolated impoverished rural community asked a man in the edge of the crowd how the people felt about a rich man from louisville who wears whiteonwhite pshirts ith french cuffs and gold cuff links and 400 suits when he came among them to ask for their votes well the man replied 1when our senator comes to see us we kind of expect him to wear his good clothes in the early spring of 1968 when he confided to me his decision to retire from the senate at age ot i told him he was unbeatable in kentucky if he wanted another term but he had made up his mind he wanted to go home to louisville he wanted to spend more time with his wife belle clay and with his fine family he wanted to do some things as a private ugust 19 l989 citizen that he thought were important and which he did not have time to do as a unitedstates senator he wanted to go home to kentucky a state where his very name echoed the rich heritage of pioneers moving westward from virginia as the new american nation expanded and developed thrustons and ballards and mortons rode in pullman cars and jetliners in later days but in the 18th century they came afoot or on horseback with a flintlock slung across their arms the 20thcentury man who came to wear all of their names in one thruiton ballard morton was a
