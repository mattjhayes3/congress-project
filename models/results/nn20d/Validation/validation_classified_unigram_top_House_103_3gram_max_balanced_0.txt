socalled mixed populations provisions the mixing of the elderly and handicapped in public housing has created problems in numerous housing authorities nationwide including one in torrington ct the incompatibility of the elderly and recovering addicts who now qualify for disability has resulted in an atmosphere of fear and distrust in public housing units such as torrington towers while i am pleased that the banking housing and urban affairs committee adopted language that allows expedited hearings for noncriminal matters and directs the department of housing and urban development to publish a concise booklet that explains what public housing directors can and cannot ask to prospective tenants i do not believe however that these provisions go far enough to protect the safety and wellbeing of public housing residents the blute amendment would simply require the disabled to sign a statement that he or she will not abuse drugs or alcohol in such a way that would interfere with the health safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants violation of this written promise would be grounds for eviction the amendment also requires the eviction of any nonelderly person who on three separate occasions engages in a criminal or disruptive activity that threatens the health safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by the other tenants the problem the blute amendment addresses is one that we helped to create by changing the disability laws we have actually passed in this house an amendment of those disability laws that will limit eligibility for disability benefits to 3 years for drug and alcohol recovering addicts that is a step forward and will help in addressing this problem but changing our disability laws is not enough and the solutions adopted by the department of housing and urban development are not adequate publishing a concise booklet better describing how to select good tenants is nice but after all most of our housing directors already know how to interview tenants most of them have had responsibility for this kind of work over many years 0 11 20 while the new booklet may help but it will not help a lot expedited hearings for noncriininal matters are useful as well but we all know how long even this process takes the bottom line here is that housing in our senior housing buildings is notjust about a roof over ones head in my part of the country where there is ice and snow on the ground much of the year a roof over your head is only part of housing these buildings are communities they are places where people have tea together they have community events together it is truly tragic when elderly citizens have to come to me and i had a meeting with them recently and share their real fear about what is happening in what used to be a really wonderful not only senior housing building but also a senior community members of that community stood up at my recent meeting and said i am afraid i am afraid to go down to our teas i am afraid to go down to our afternoon coffees that is wrong we owe it to the seniors of america to make sure that they are not afraid to get together in their own buildings in fact their fear is the consequence of our rather unthoughtful action in making a whole population not only eligible for benefits but eligible also to share senior housing theblute amendment is very simple and will help it would only require tenants to sign a statement that they would not abuse drugs and alcohol in a way that would interfere with the health safety or right of peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants violation of that agreement would be grounds for eviction that is not a big deal tenants should not be acting in a way that threatens the health safety and wellbeing of our senior tenants the blute amendment goes on to say that if there are three separate occasions of disorderly conduct that that is also grounds for eviction we owe it to those who run our senior housing buildings in america to give them a clear standard and an effective way to deal with some of the tenant problems that they now face in speaking with constituents from northwestern connecticut it has become painfully clear to me that the mixed populations issue needs to be addressed aggressively by congress our senior citizens living in public housing should not be forced to live in fear of their neighbors but rather should be able to enjoy a community atmosphere in their public housing building for these reasons i rise in support of the blute amefidment"],

opinion amongst those of us on the committee and i think bringing that all together into something we all can support deserves a great of credit on monday president clinton addressed the united

fiscal year 1994 44 million for fiscal year 1995 and 45 1 million for fiscal year the funding levels for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 are consistent with those requested by the ntsb however the funding level for fiscal year 1994 is 455 000 more than the president re quested the additional funding in the judgment of the subcommittee and the full committee on public works and transportation would permit the ntsb to retain its current staff rather than take a staff reduction of nine positions which would have been necessary if the requested funding level had not been authorized i want to point

the presidents call for a reduction of federal positions and while i generally agree with the administration about the need to shrink the size of government this is an area that we must not shrink or

conclusions it is rare in the federal government for interested parties to be universally satisfied with the work of an investigative agency no agency likes to have its work critiqued or criticized but the ntsb has developed such a stature that during our reauthorization process not a single industry organization labor group or federal agency had enough concern about the ntsb work to send a single witness to testify in opposition to or express concern about the ntsb i think that io an extraordinary record of accomplishment especially to come to this point of a reauthorization without industry criticism i think it is vitally important that congressional action assure the ntsb of the funding levels it needs to maintain the personnel maintain the staffing competence and professionalism to avoid any question any hint of deterioration in the quality of their work product clearly it is not cost effective to reduce funding for an agency whose recommendations whose
