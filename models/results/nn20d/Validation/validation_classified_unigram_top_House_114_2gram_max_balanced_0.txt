special interest regulations at the behest of extremist environmental groups that seem more intent on thwarting the american energy renaissance than on actually creating a safer rail network in fact

regulation in search of a problem department of transportation secretary anthony foxx said as much in 2014 when he admitted the truth is that 99 9 percent of these oil shipments reach their destinations safely these new and overreaching mandates require railroad companies to unnecessarily increase their steel tank walls and will require significant upgrades and retrofitting for an estimated 154 500 tank cars in fact the wall street journal has reported the steel jacket alone would lower a cars 30 000gallon capacity by about 800 gallons forcing shippers to deploy more cars according to rail industry analysts clearly this is an unintended consequence of these new regulations for a 01 percent problem which actually increases this 01 percent user accident rate percentage by requiring significantly more railcars to actually haul the amount of oil in addition the aggressive timeline proposed by the dot for completing these retrofits is unrealistic and could harm consumers by disrupting the production and transportation of goods that play major roles in our economy including chemicals gasoline crude oil and ethanol if democrats and this administration were really concerned about rail safety for transporting oil they would approve the keystone pipeline pipelines are the safest way to transfer crude our country is in the midst of an energy renaissance
