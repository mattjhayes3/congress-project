day after day to share with the members what we are doing right and what we are doing wrong so many times we focus on this side of the aisle on the plans that we have here on the democratic side of the aisle inhelping americans to continue to prosper need it be they are in small business or they wake up and go to work every day educating our children making sure that we have a healthy and prosperous and safe america before i get started i know mr ryan will be joining me momentarily i just want to share with the members a few plans that we have on this side of the aisle that we would like to implement the only thing that is stopping us from bringing these plans to the floor and implementing action well we are moving in the right direction with great force is the fact that we are not the majority here to be able to bring these issues to the floor as you know in the past i have talked about energy i encourage members to go to housedemocrats gov to pick up a copy of our energy agenda talking about alternative fuel talking about bringing about flex vehicles in the industry to be able to allow more americans to purchase vehicles that are flex vehicles that they can use e85 and gasoline real security plan it is there dealing with homeland security we have already said on this side of the aisle if we are in the majority that we would irplement all of the 9 11 recommendations to make america safer this is a bipartisan commission as the members know that was appointed and this house was part of it and they did outstanding work those recommendations have still not been fully implemented to protect america we have our initiative that we have been trying to promote for the last 3 to 4 months in a very forceful way which is allowing working americans to be able to earn more money it has been 9 years since the american people have received an increase as it relates to the minimum wage it is very very unfortunate that we have americans that are working for 5 15 an hour the minimum wage has been the same since 1997 which is now approaching 10 years as you know many americans have suffered under the low minimum wage that we have now that is throughout for individuals that are working every day and i have a few facts here of the last 50years i mean this is the lowest it has been in the last 50 years also 6 6 million americans will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage and something that i must add the republican leadership has said that they vow not to raise the minimum wage again this year or next year so i think that is something that the american people need to pay very close attention to threequarters of the minimum wage workers are adults that are over the age of 20 many of whom are responsible for over half of the familys income one day of work it takes an entire days wage for an earner to buy a tank of gas also studies have shown that zero jobs have been lost when the minimum wage has been increased eightysix percent of americans do support an increase in the minimum wage twentyone states have moved in the direction of increasing the minimum wage i do not know what is going on here with the republican majority in not moving in that direction to allow more american people to have money in their pocket to be able to provide for their families we havetalked many times on this floor in the 30something workifg group about the new weight that has been placed on the heads of the american people as they start to send their young people to college li 1730 just yesterday we had a town hall meeting downstairs in this building in hc5 here in the capitol building with some young people who are thirdparty validators with the student loans they have out now and this is very serious because now people are starting to prepare their young people to go off to college in the month of august and late july many of whom are now having to take out these student loans at a very high interest rate they are going to end up paying almost 100 more a month in interest to pay for their college and i think that is something we need to pay very close attention to it is very unfortunate that on the majority side on the republican side all due respect to all the innovation that one tries to come up with on the other side of the aisle it is costing the american people more and it is putting our young people in debt in this country even before they can grab their college degree and earn a living they are already on average somewhere around 25 000 or 30 000 in debt when they step across the stage that is very very unfortunate we cut student aid here we increase student loan rates here the states in turn have to cut and the cost of college is increased it increases on these individuals it is an increase on these individuals i think it is also important mr speaker for us to talk about the fact that we have the will and the desire on this side of the aisle to move america in the right direction i talked about this last week and i think it is very very important to bring this up here again today that we are willing to move this country in the right direction in a new direction making sure that americans have more opportunities i think it is important for us to point out the fact that on this side of the aisle we have committed again to raising the minimum wage we have committed to helping this country become energy independent investing in the midwest versus the middle east within 10 years we have also committed on this side of the aisle i mentioned it earlier to implementing all of the 9 11 recommendations but one of our major commitments on this side and also to the american people is that we have said that we are willing to bring this budget back into balance within a reasonable time not that we are going to cut the deficit in half or we are going to balance the budget but we are going to be able to bring us out of this deficit spending that the republican majority has led us into with record deficits as far as the eye can see we have the resume on our resume we have the accomplishment of being able to do that we have accomplished that before in the past and i think it is something that one needs to pay very close attention to when we say a commitment to making sure our fiscal house is in order it is not a slogan it is not something that someone says well the polls say you need to say you are going to bring spending under control we have actually attempted to do that you have seen this chart before we cant talk about it enough because the facts are in regardless of the floor speeches that may go on on the republican side of the aisle i think it is important for us to outline the fact that we have put our legislation where our mouths are we have said that we want to see this house say that if you are going to spend then spend in a way that almost every american family has to spend if you are going to buy something you have to know how you are going to pay for it you cant put everything on a credit card and what is unfortunate is that we have allowed other countries to be a part of our country financially not because the american people have made a bad decision but it is because the majority and the white house have made some bad decisions here i have a paygo rule that on this side we have adopted that we are willing to pay as we go if you are going to buy it you have to show how you are going to pay for it it is not that you spend or you buy and then you borrow john spratt who is the ranking member on the budget committee on the 2006 budget resolution and this is the congressional record this is not something the 30something working group put together this is rollcall vote 87 march 17 of 2005 republicans voted 228 against this payasyougo amendment that we put forward again mr sprat and the ranking members substitute amendment to house concurrent resolution 393 this is also rollcall vote number 91 march 25 2004 224 republicans voting against payasyougo on a rule we tried to put in place when i say try that is all we can do at this particular point because until democrats are in the majority we are not going to be able to put this country into the fiscal position it should be in once again and i do say once again i pull my chart out this is almost my exhibit a here thirdparty validator and the source that has given us this information happens to be the unitedstates department of the treasury here we show that 42 presidents over 224 years were only able to borrow from foreign nations and this is money that the united states has borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years and 42 presidents 1 01 trillion through world war i world war ii the great depression a number of other conflicts slowdowns in the economy and other issues that have faced this country 42 presidents have only borrowed 1 01 trillion in 4 years 4 years with president bush 1 05 trillion with the republican congress just in 4 years if someone came to me and said kendrick you have to throw all the charts out but one if you just wanted one chart this would be the one that i would pick because i think it reveals what has happened here in this house how it has been so easy for the republican majority to put runaway spending on a credit card and allowed foreign countries to be able to own a part of the american apple pie what is so very very unfortunate here as all of this borrowing has taken place you would think that student loans would have a lower interest rate you would think that alternative fuels would have an opportunity to be a part of the marketplace and that we would be moving towards more cleanerburning fuel you would think that we would have a worldclass health care system and that companies as big as general motors and as small as a momandpop store that has five or six employees in it would be able to provide health care for their employees and you would also think that a number of states would not be suing the federal government because of the underfunding of the leave no child behind with all of the money that has been borrowed from foreign nations but what has happened is that the superwealthy in this country have gotten the biggest tax cut inf the history of the republic what has also happened is that republicans have been allowed to spend in recordbreaking i mean just off the charts for republicans to come down here and blame democrats for spendingi mean really i know it is kind of hard for them to keep eye contact with someone like me and those of us in the 30something group who knows better who know what the facts show that 1 05 trillion has been borrowed from foreign countries they are weakening our country as they start to move and allow these other countries to be able to own so much of the american apple pie and i will close with this before i yield to ms wasserman schultz who came in before mr ryan i think it is important for us to look at it from this standpoint that if you borrow money from someone the relationship has changed i heard someone from the white house say this morning on the today show we are the last standing superpower okay well you must be talking about militarily because financially we are getting weaker every day under this administrations policy and the rubberstamping of this republican congress i think it is important that everyone understands that we have borrowed money from countries that we have never borrowed money from before in a recordbreaking way the republican majority has done so without our help but because they are in the majority that has happened and now they are looking at us under a different light we still have budgets that are being passed here on this floor that is going to even make the american people more indebted to foreign nations some that we have questions of their links to possible terrorism and other questionable measures with that i would like to yield to ms wasserman schultz"],

the president total credit for all of this he couldnt do it by himself you have to have a rubber stamp congress to give you full power full power to be able to take the country down the track it has gone down and the bottom line is that a republican majority from the leadership on down to the newly elected member of the republican conference has to take credit for giving the president the kind of power that he has right now we are fighting wars abroad for democracy when here at home we dont celebrate that very democracy that so many people speak of we have individuals that are on their third and fourth deployment i am on the armed services committee so i get the reports i get the letters from my constituents saying my husband my wife my mother my dad my niece my uncle my nextdoor neighboris on his way back to iraq again abec se we went alone we didnt go with a true coalition so i think it would be hard if i was a part of the republican majority to try to muster up some talking points for the floor right now to be able to say well okay some of this stuff is not believable so lets try to attack some members of the democratic caucus lets try to muster up and embellisha record on possibly being weak on terrorism or being weak on national security thats where the republican majority is now they are gasping for political air right now but you know what is so important about this issue and this discussion about national security is that it is supposed to be nonpolitical and unfortunately it is and that is because the majority hasnt allowed bipartisanship in this house for so many years and so they can hang it around their neck and say it is our war it is our failure as it relates to national security and border security dont act like it is a crisis right now you allowed it to happen under your watch you have been the rubber stamp congress now mr ryan and ms wasserman schultz let me just tell you what the rubber stamp congress has accomplished borrowing 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 4 years in more than 224 years of this countrys history with 42 presidents 1 01 trillion they were able to borrow in 4 years and this republican congress and the president has allowed that to happen these are the countries here that own a part of the american apple pie japan china the u k the caribbean taiwan germany and opec nations you know this whole oil thing that we will talk about in a minute korea and canada they all have their hands in the pockets of the unitedstates taxpayers not because of the unitedstates taxpayers but because of the republican majoritys outofcontrol spending oil companies oh wow at this time in history when they unearth what happened under this republican majority and this presidency they will see these record breaking profits there was a meeting in the white house i have the article to prove it and i talk about it all time it was a special meeting that took place in the white house and the vice presidents aides and all met and then the policymakers came here to the congress to the rubber stamp congress now let me set this up here because we believe in the 30something working group in thirdparty validators washington post wednesday november 16 2005 white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long expected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by the white house last week industry officials testified before congress document obtained by the post on november 2005 shows that officials from exxon mobil phillips shell oil companies and bp of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides to develop a national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated in congress that was 2001 look what happened 2002 34 billion recordbreaking profits 2003 53 billion 2004 84 billion 2005 113 billion in profits for oil companies meanwhile average americans are spending through the nose and trying to make it to work and to drop their kids off look what happened here this is what happened under the republican majority and a rubber stamp congress so shall it be written and so shall it be done e85 we talk about alternative fuels flex vehicles every magazine i open talks about flex vehicles here is the bottom line the republican congress have allowed these oil companies to be able to do anything they want to do when they want to do it this is an actual pump here at an exxonmobil station it says you cannot use your mobil credit card to buy e85 meanwhile we can continue to feed off the saudi arabian middle east what got us in this thing in the first place policies you can use your oil card there you can buy a bag of chips you can buy a carton cigarettes but e85 that is produced in the midwest versus the middle east you cannot use your mobil credit card for that and on retirement packages and i dont know very much about lee raymond but the bottom line is he is a retired executive from exxonmobil with a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break this is what happens with a republican majority again the republican majority rubber stamp dont worry about balancing the budget democrats we tried to balance the budget we have done it before we have tried to do it under this republican majority not one republican vote to balance the budget on rollcall vote 87 march 17 2005 ranking member spratt and the budget committee put it forth again failed not one republican vote on rollcall vote 91 in 2004 their will and desire is not there the american people deserve balance minimum wage yes there was some bill that came up before we left for the break to talk about minimum wage a bill that the republican majority knew that the senate would not take up and would never make it to the presidents desk but because we were hammering them on it they said lets pass this they added all kinds of stuff it is called the potomac twostep this chart the bottom line is these are not minimum wage increases these are increases for members of congress this is our pay this is what we make oh look at them since 1997 there hasnt been an increase in the minimum wage and you not a minimum wage worker right now and i am not talking to the members of congress i am talking to the american people the bottom line is if the minimum wage goes up and that means if you are a salaried worker then your wages will go up but the bottom line is that it is a fact that the republican congress has said not over our dead body we are going to get our increase but we are not going to give the american people a minimum wage increase it goes on and on and on i am going to close with this the prime minister of iraq and the president of iran mr delahunt brought this picture out last night i dont care whichever way you cut 300 billion of spending over 2 000 troops thousands and thousands of american troops injured here in washington d c stay the course no plan the secretary of defense says if you talk about or say anything about redeployment of troops or withdrawing from iraq you are fired no question from the congress no response from the congress the secretary of defense is not called to the hill immediately the republican congress what are they saying they are saying nothing so accountability is not there they are embracing and guess what this is a la the unitedstates taxpayer through the republican majority because of a lack of diplomacy and a lack of plan and going to a war of choice versus after osama bin laden in afghanistan andgiving those troops in afghanistan the support they need so ms wasserman schultz mr ryan i rest my case the bottom line is that was not a message for democrats or republicans it was not a message for independents or the green party or other party affiliations that is a message for americans the bottom line is whatever you may feel if you are a member of the republican executive committee or you have always voted republican or you always voted independent you have to have issues with what the facts are i yield to ms wasserman schultz"],

now i am just wondering how did we got to where we are now i think we have gotten there because of this rubber stamp that is here it is not just a rubber stamp it is the republican congress rubber stamp and it is very very unfortunate that the people that are paying the price for this rubber stamp are the american people at the gas pump this is graduation time a lot of parents are going to see their children walk across the stage but guess what college assistance and affordable loans will not be there for those children because we are willing to give 42 000 43 000 in tax breaks to millionaires the republican congress says they gave tax cuts for the american people yes they are american people too but i am not talking about the middle class the middle class family does not consider themselves millionaires i am holding this rubber stamp because this is what got us here mr ryan talks about paying for that let us put that rubber stamp over here how we are paying for it is we are making history in all the wrong places 224 years 1 01 trillion borrowed over 224year 42 presidents combined 1 01 trillion the republican congress and president bush he could not do it without the republican congress has been able to borrow 1 05 trillion over just 4 years 224 years versus 4 years even though we are at war even though we have little health care for americans if any ana we have given out tax breaks to the oil companies"], [0.13241738080978394, 0.8675826191902161, 1, "the republican majority is big on the talk in the stump speech and having the press conference with security homeland security all this kind of stuff but when it comes down to the printed word when it comes down to the budget that is handed out from the white house and when it comes down to what this republican majority does it is 2 000 from what the 911 commission called for and what we called for as house democrats versus the presidents proposal and you can look it up on line that only asks for 210 agents democrats fought for the funding on almost five different occasions again for the record ms wasserman schultz h r 1268 a motion to recommit and 2 000 vote number 160 and that happened on 5 5 05 also you look at house bill 2360 was blocked it was an obey amendment vote number 174 that was on 5 17 05 it failed 223 to 185 on a partisan vote h r 1817 a motion to recommit 2005 again vote number 188 again failed on partisan lines you start talking about on border security and closing the gaps on nine separate occasions over the last 5 years democrats put forth motions here on this floor because that is the only thing we can do being in the minority we are not able to bring the bills to the floor because the majority is blocking those bills from getting out of committee and they are noted right here and i am not going to go through that at this particular time but all of this is on line housedemocrats gov if anyone wants to go on and get this information also when you start talking about aviation security democrats offered a motion to require air cargo to be screened within 3 years the motion was rejected by republicans again 2005 vote number 188 5 18 05 democrats have spoken repeatedly on the issue of transit security making sure that we authorize including a 2 8 billion initiative to improve transit security and a 1 billion initiative to improve rail security substitute amendment defeated again so when you start look looking at the record and what the record says versus what is said here on the floor by the republican majority and the rubber stamp majority i wish the rubber stamp republican majority would stop fighting us and start saying to the president guess what we no longer want to rubber stamp everything that you send here i just wish the republican majority would just leader up and say hey mr president so you start reading the paper could someoneget me a newspaper please because i want to just have it as a prop because as americans start reading the paper they are reading about how republican members of the house and the senate the president flies into town they get on the plane and leave town some even get in their car and go i was on the other side of my district well let me tell you something if the president of the united states is in my district i think i would know i think it would be some sort of news flash or some sort of email that would come to me and say you know the president is coming in your district today will be in an elementary school maybe you want to be there he is the leader of the free world maybe you want to be there the reason why they are taking flights while the president is coming in the reason why they are finding something else to do while the president is in their town is the fact that they dont want to be caught in the same situation with the president of the united states because they have not stood up to the president and said no you cant put us in a financial situation as far as the eye can see as it relates to deficits and foreign countries running the world you cant pick up the paper today not talking about a republican running from the president of the united september 12 2006 co states and dont want to be around when the president is around or explaining why they are not there that is some excuse i hope i never get to the situation where i have the president of the united states coming into my district and i have to explain that i am somewhere else while the president is there and the bottom line is this people cannot face the music when it comes down to dealing with the policies of this administration and better yet you being in the position there is only 535 of us being in the position as i come in for a landing ms wasserman schultz to be able to bring about change on behalf of the american people to say this is not going to happen to say i know you want to start a war in iraq but we still got this business over here with al qaeda who had everything to do with 9 11 who trained the individuals that carried out the 9 11 plot but meanwhile while we are over therelooking for osama bin laden and we have him cornered i got this unfinished business the president said over here in iraq because i got a problem with this leader over here we got to take him out but what about the after player what is going to happen once you get to baghdad how are you going to bring stability who is going to be in the coalition calling up a couple of friends ill send 25 troops ill send 30 troops you are not allowed to talk about it everything is secret we have the then sitting attorney general comes to the unitedstates congress over on the senate side and tells the senate you are either with us or you are with the terrorists 0l 2340 what kind of mess is that so when it comes down to article i section 1 and if the american people want the kind of representation they need i am not talking as a democrat even though we were given an hour by the deqiocratic leader and we are all members of the democratic caucus this is america i guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot ms wasserman schultz i cannot help but imagine the kind of chaos and protest and finger pointing and them and they and all of the things that will be said some of the stuff will have to be stricken from the record because the republican side will be carrying on about the democrats but they cannot say it they cant do it they cannot even kind of paint a picture because they have been in charge of the whole thing since it started so if the american people want a new direction if the american people want accountability if the american people want a house and a senate that will carry out article i section 1 of the unitedstates constitution and a lot of blood is on this constitution but if they want that then they will vote for a new direction in november i am done ladies and gentlemen with begging the republican majority to stand up on behalf of the american people because i am looking at what the oil companies are getting they are getting theirs i am looking at what these contractors are getting either it be katrina or the war in iraq they are getting theirs i am looking at the issue of health care and all of the people that are running to the bank with all of the dollars and all of the influence and all of the access into this congress they are getting theirs meanwhile we are sitting around here talking about the minimum wage and we cant even get a doggone bill passed off this floor to be able to provide the american people with a minimum wage meanwhile we are giving ourselves a nice fat pay raise every year 4 100 here 3 100 there oh we have the money for that but we dont have the money for the people who are punching in and punching out every day this has to come to an end and that is the reason why ms wasserman schultz that i believe there is a wind of change it may not be outside the hall of this chamber but it is out there in america it is in towns and it is in big cities and it is in emerging areas and it is in young people and older people that have decided in the past i am not going to participate but i believe they are

working group we come to the floor daily to share not only with the members of the house but also the american people about plans we have that is in holding or in waiting not because of the fact that we are not willing to move forth on behalf of the american people it is because the republican majority has decided not to govern on the side of the american people i feel that this is very very hard core for everyday americans because they are in waiting not only inthe area of minimum wage but also affordable fuel prices and real solutions as relates to protecting our country and also making sure that our veterans who have allowed us to serve who have allowed us to salute one flag will be honored in the area of health care and other areas that we have promised them i am going to start off my comments and i am glad mr delahunt is here and i know others are on their way to the floor to at least talk about this minimum wage conversation that we are having here on the floor of the house of representatives i feel that we should take action we want to take action on this side of the aisle democrats united in making sure that some 6 millionplus americans are able to get a pay increase something that members of congress have enjoyed overa number of years but everyday working americans are not able to receive more minimum wage than what they are receiving right now they are right now making 5 and some change and i mean it is unconscionable for members of the house to be able to walk away with an increase costofliving increase meanwhile those individuals that are punching in and punching out every day are still making the same rate that they were making in 1997 it would be an uproar here in this house if members of congress had not received a pay raise since 1997 one thing that i can say here on this side of the aisle the democratic leadership and the democratic caucus has said we will not stand for an increase for members of congress to make more money if we are not going to raise the level of minimum wage for everyday americans and so again we come with thirdparty validators we come with the facts to share with the american people and we come to let the american people know and members on the majority side that we have the will and the desire to lead and we will if we have the opportunity after november i just wanted to share a few things because there are a lot of folks that are out there saying that they are fighting on behalf of the everyday american so i thought i would just bring a couple of visual aids and also some information this is the source of the college board 2005 as it relates to the census and what americans are dealing with i want to start with this next chart here i want to start with this chart minimum wage and this is real economic change under bush here you have the minimum wage that is at zero starting in 1997 to now since 1997 to now whole milk has gone up 24 percent bread has gone up 25 percent a 4year public college education has gone up 77 percent health care insurance has gone up 97 percent meanwhile americans are still making 5 and change regular gas has gone up 136 percent still no message from the republican majority for everyday working americans that punch in and punch out every day li 2310 here are some other statistics still from 1997 no increase in the minirhum wage for everyday working americans college tuition has gone up in private institutions 40 percent gas prices again as it relates to the middle class has gone up 47 percent and 55 percent for prescription drugs i think it is important that we look at those to go further i think it is important that we share this the facts are hard but they are true in 1998 a member of congress received a raise of 3 100 that was in 1998 in 1998 the minimum wage was zero again in 2000 members of congress received a 4 600 raise that is more money everyday working americans in 2000 minimum wage zero thanks to the republican majority i just said in 2000 mr delahunt members received a pretty substantial raise in 2001 members of congress received a 3 800 raise of course we are not minimumwage workers the american people in 2001 zero nothing the republican majority said they are not going to have it in 2002 again a 4 900 that is a lot of money increase for members of congress the american people in 2002 zero it pays to have a voting card in congress you can give yourself a raise but the folks that elect you just have to suck it up now this is like on a roll here in congress in 2003 a 4 700 increase in members of congress pay the american people guess what zero nothing at alr thanks to the republican majority in 2004 a 3 400 raise for members of congress guess what members american people minimum wage raises zero these are the facts i challenge any member on the republican side the majority to come down and challenge me on these facts in 2005 it continues a 4 000 raise once again you are a member of congress that comes up here who say they are representing you it is a wonderful thing get a raise in 2005 4 000 the american people zero in 2006 members of congress proposed raise 3 100 mr delahunt my 9yearold son and my 11yearold daughter can guess the american people to this date zero now i want to go back to this chart because i think it is very revealing and very accurate i have been in this business for 25 years and i never voted for an increase in the minimum wage and i am opposed to it and i think that a vast majority of our conference is opposed to it that is the leader of the republican congress that is the majority leader now mr delahunt there are members that come to this floor and say the democrats are just demagoguing there are people who come to this floor and say we are for you they are not for leading i think it is important mr delahunt that we come to the floor and share with the american people and the members of congress that we will not rest even though we are in the minority that we are still willing to fight for them now the difference between the republican majority and the democratic minority is the fact that the majority has the power to be able to make things happen here in this house on behalf of the american people as it relates to the minimum wage and it is fair play i went through this list pay increases year after year 4 000 here 4 700 there 3 100 here and zero since 1997 on behalf of the american people who punch in and punch out every day meanwhile health care cost is up meanwhile the cost of bread and milk is up meanwhile gas prices are up by 136 percent but back at the ranch and here in this house the members of congress are being taken care of the special interests are being taken care of but guess what the individuals who woke up early on a tuesday morning for representation are being left behind since 1997 and there are members on the majority side saying over their dead bodies literally will they receive an increase because they are so indebted mr delahunt to their special interests so all we can fight with here is the fact not fiction but fact that we have a republican majority that is willing to govern for the few for those individuals who have the opportunity to come to washington and to be able to gain access through the k street project and other programs that allow them to give politically and have gangs here in the house a former member of this house used to boast about the fact that if they were not on the list of contributors they couldnt come in and see them that is a former member of the house and if anybody wants to challenge me on it from the majority side i will be happy to reveal that former members name i think we all know and it was an active program in the house and i believe there are still some elements of that program now the fact that special interests do not want an individual making 5 and some change to receive a couple dollars increase is very unfortunate and mr delahunt i am very concerned about that let me just take 3 more minutes mr delahunt and then i am going to yield to you because you have some very interesting charts over there let us talk about who is getting what in the past you have heard me read this and i want to read it again because when it comes down to when their constituents want to know whose side they are on i want the members to be armed with the facts i am proud that i am trying to do everything i can do on behalf of my constituents back in the 17th congressional district in dade and broward county but by their sending me to congress and mr delahunt to congress they federalized us to represent the people of the united states of america and i think it is our obligation to share the facts members can follow me they can go on washingtonpost com this was an article november 16 2005 on the front page a white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president dick cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long suspected by environmentalists but denied as recently as a week ago by industry officials testifying before congress the document obtained this week by the washington post shows that officials from the exxonmobil corporation phillips shell oil company and bp america inc met in the white house complex with the cheney aids who were developing national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated here in the house this is an article it is not from the democratic caucus it is not from my office or mr delahunts office let us see what happened that meeting mr delahunt and members was in 2001 here are the profit margins of big oil companies since that meeting in 2002 i think that was a pretty good meeting to go to 34 billion in profits thanks to the republican majoritys passing policy that would allow oil companies to spend tle taxpayers dollars and to be able to have subsidies and make these profits in 2003 59 billion in profits i think that meeting was worth going to and whoever recommended and got them into the white house complex to meet with the cheney aides i think they got a promotion and possibly a bonus li 2320 in 2004 84 billion oil profits up guess who is paying for it the american people in 2005 113 billion in profits and the numbers are not even in from 2006 i know that these facts have to have some members who may be in their offices right now or sitting up in their beds feel uncomfortable but unfortunately that is not happening because it continues why is this man smiling here it is nothing against him i dont have anything personally against oil companies they are getting what the majority republican conference here in this house has allowed them to have it is one thing for someone to gay i will support you and your political endeavors it is another thing for you to say i am with you all the way even if it costs my constituents more at the pump here is a man that a lot of workers wish they had such a deal a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break ala the republican majority an exxon former executive it is almost unfair someone may say that if i didnt have the thirdparty validators the congressional record and votes by the majority to back up what i am saying some folks would say that is unfair i wouldnt even be able to walk the halls of congress or talk to my colleagues on the republican side if i wasnt telling the truth i think it is important that everyone understands if you are a republican you have to have a problem with what i just presented you have to if you are a democrat you have to have a problem the information i am sharing with you that the republican majority is allowing to happen we on this side have called for an increase in the minimum wage we on this side have called for tough legislation on price gouging we on this side have talked about making ourselves energy independent not investing in the middle east but investing in the midwest as it relates to e85 so i think it is important that everyone understands when we are in the majority if the american people see fit we will put forth policy that will benefit all americans i think it is important if you are an independent you have to have a problem with the fact that members of congress have received thousands upon thousands of dollars of raises since 1997 and still no response from the republican majority as it relates to the minimum wage"], [0.1325271725654602, 0.8674728274345398, 1, "since president bush took office the amount of foreignheld treasury debt has more than doubled increasing from 1 trillion to 2 1 trillion meaning that this administration has already accrued more foreign debt than the previous 42 presidents combined let me repeat that this president and this republicanled congress has borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors than the previous 42 presidents combined as you can see here in 2001 the amount of money borrowed from foreign central banks and from foreign investors was 988 billion that was troubling enough in 2006 we are up to 2 66 trillion that has been borrowed from foreigners unlike deficits in earlier years current deficits have been primarily financed by foreign investors with the rise in foreignheld debt equaling threefourths the increase in publiclyheld debt since the start of the current administration in 2001 this rise in foreignheld debt is troubling because it makes our econormy beholden to foreign creditors and represents another financial burden passed on to future generations foreignheld debt is fundamentally different from domesticallyheld debt since the interest payments on foreignheld debt flow outside the united states of america and reduce americans standard of living the cost of servicing foreignheld debt is high local state and federal government interest rates to foreign investors totaled 114 billion in 2005 an amount that will grow rapidly if the treasury continues to sell debt to foreign investors at the current rate compare this to only 23 billion in foreign holdings in 1993 today the debt the foreignheld debt is 2 1 trillion and just like david letterman i have got a top ten list the top ten current lenders again our government is borrowing 1 billion a day we keep passing tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year and where does the

middleclass working families in america i salute him for his excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford president bush and the republicans it is time for a new direction we can begin by rejecting this estate tax giveaway to the wealthy and insist on a vote to increase the minimum wage that would be a real values

have two purposes one is to shovel certain substances to obscure what they are really doing and the other is to dig the debt hole of the united states of america the indebtedness of the american people yet deeper while languishing programs that are important to average folks while the wealthy get more this budget would reserve substantial funding for tax cuts for the richest among us it would reserve tax cuts so that we can extend the tax where people who own stock that pays dividends would pay a much lower rate of tax than an american who works for say 30 000 a year in wages and salary it would extend the capital gains tax cuts which again primarily benefit people over 300 000 a year for someone who earns 50 60 000 a year the average tax break in capital gains is 50 since we exempt peoples principal residence that is where most middle class people have their capital they do not have a whole lot of other investments they are kind of struggling to get by this budget is not going to help this budget would borrow every penny we are taxing working people more than we need to collect money for social security the theory is that money is being set aside to pay for the retirement of the baby boom the coming change in the demographics of the society the crisis the president talked about in funding social security well what are the president and republicans doing with the 192 billion extra we will collect in social security taxes this year only from people who earn 94 000 a year or less they are going to spend it they are going to spend part of it on tax cuts for people who earn a heck of a lot more than 94 000 a year this deficitproducing budget is going to do an incredible disservice to our nation it will give us a new record and of course there have been many records under the bush administration and this will set the record of the five consecutive years of largest deficits in the history of the united states from the small government folks down there at 1600 pennsylvania avenue now true a lot of it is done in emergency supplementals they cannot anticipate this budget for instance says unlike the president who says it will be a future president who decides when and if the united states withdraws from iraq the republican budget as honest as the day is long says that we will spend 50 billion next year on iraq and afghanistan of course that is quite a bit less than half of what we spent this year so maybe they know something the president does not know and america does not know about the withdrawal timetable or maybe it is more dishonest bookkeeping where we will have yet another unanticipated expense for the war in iraq and the ongoing problems of pacifying afghanistan so this budget is rife with these sorts of things the total deficit this year will be 543 billion including borrowing 192 billion of hardearned money that is going to pay for supposedly future social security retirement and over 5 years they are going to raise the debt of the united states of america again it has been raised four times in the last 5 years the debt ceiling has been raised it is a 65 percent increase in the indebtedness of the united states of america this president has accumulated more foreign debt than the 42 presidents that preceded him in office record after record after record is falling to the republican leadership and the republicans in the white house something that they can be proud of all so they can feed tax cuts for people who earn over a million bucks a year that is really a great way to run a country they are anticipating with this budget again even with dishonest bookkeeping that we will be up to 11 3 trillion of debt by 2011 that would be about 27 000 for every american 27 000 of debt that would have more than doubled the debt since george bush took office doubling the debt in that short period of time is again quite an accomplishment it took 42 presidents and more than 200 years to accumulate a significant debt and the president is going to manage to double it in a mere 5 years so hopefully we can take away the shovels we can pull aside the veils we can reveal to america what is going on and

happening in the middle east and here lately in terms of those who were asleep at the switch when the deal was cut in terms of the port security all show a considerable lack of judgment and a lack of responsibility to the american people that has been a characteristic within this administration especially in the area dealing with one of the most precious responsibilities we have which is determining and being responsible for how we spend the taxpayers money for this administration in the last 5 years to have squandered a surplus the facts are there they are plain as one can see when the clinton administration left office there was a surplus of billions and billions of dollars and now in this last year the deficit has been shot up over 4 trillion there is a reckoning for that and

consume the challenges we face today in sudan are perhaps among the most difficult of our time the interminable war between khartoum and the rebels in the south claimed the lives of over 2 million people and was punctuated by brutalities that strain our credulity the united states poured hundreds of millions of dollars into humanitarian relief for sudan but never bothered to effectively engage in a highlevel effort to resolve the conflict until 2001 when president bush appointed senator john danforth to serve as a special envoy to sudan with senator danforths leadership the comprehensive peace agreement for sudan was signed in january of 2005 presenting a historic opportunity for peace economic development and democratic aspirations in southern sudan unfortunately implementation of the peace agreement has been slow and many difficult challenges lie ahead while the international community focused on resolving the war in the south a genocidal campaign was unleashed by the government of sudan in the darfur region of western sudan as many as 400 000 people have died since 2004 and more than 2 million others have been forced from their homes once again the unitedstates government provided millions of dollars to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of those most affected by the conflict including more than 150 million to support the deployment and operations of the african union peacekeepers in darfur this time however the unitedstates immediately engaged at the highest levels to seek a resolution to the conflict two years of intense negotiations with significant engagement by president bush himself finally yielded a peace agreement between the government of sudan and the largest rebel faction in darfur the sla in may of this year unfortunately the agreement has not held and the sudanese government has launched military operations against its own civilian population in darfur the united states has significant human rights and security interests at stake in sudan recall that in 1996 the sudanese government made osama bin laden available to american law enforcement officials a point that salah gosh reiterated to me with a great deal of sarcasm when i met with him 14 months ago in khartoum that offer as we know was refused we cannotafford to repeat those mistakes of the past the united states needs a rational well coordinated policy towards sudan that puts an end to the violence and terrorism and human rights abuses at the core of our relationship it is in this context that i welcome and we welcome as a body the presidents appointment of andrew natsios to serve as the presidential envoy for sudan the resolution before us today authored by our good friend and colleague chairman frank wolf h res 992 strongly supports the appointment of the special envoy for sudan and suggests a roadmap for the formation of a comprehensive responsible policy towards sudan it states that the special envoys mandate should include all efforts to consolidate peace throughout sudan including by ensuring full implementation of the darfur peace agreement and the comprehensive peace agreement the mandate should also include helping to secure a just and equitable peace in eastern sudan supporting reconstruction efforts and the return of displaced persons to the darfur and southern sudan and addressing the inextricably linked conflict in northern uganda in essence what will be the special envoys responsibility to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past by focusing solely on the crisis in darfur at the expense of solidifying the northsouth peace accord and resolving the conflict in the east by allowing the potential for peace in southern sudan to blind us to the grave human rights tragedies continuing to unfold in darfur and by allowing the government of sudans reported cooperation in the war on terror to outweigh human rights concerns in the region they must be paramount and also to allow those same human rights concerns to compromise our ability to protect our own citizens again this is a good resolution i would note parenthetically that originally it called for the creation this resolution by mr wolf of a special envoy thankfully events have overcome the resolution and now we are congratulating the administration for doing just that creating a special envoy for sudan i reserve the balance
