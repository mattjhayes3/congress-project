save american consumers billions of dollars it will also remove a significant federal barrier to a more competitive electric power industry more than 20 years ago the public utility regulatory policies act purpa was enacted as one of the original components of the carter energy plan convinced that we were running out of natural gas and that the price of oil would soar to 100 per barrel or even more by the year 2000 congress passed purpa to encourage conservation and promote the use of renewable fuels to generate electricity it did this by establishing a special class of power generators known as qualifying facilities ofs and it required utilities to buy all the electricity that these facilities wished to sell at a price determined generally by federal regulators and specifically by state regulators congress sought in drafting purpa to ensure that customers would pay no more for purpa power than they would have to pay for other power it did this by providing in purpa that the maximum price for electricity from qfs would be the cost that the purchase utility would have incurred if it had generated the electricity itself or had purchased it from a source other than the qf unfortunately this has not proven to be the case because govemnment projections of utility avoided costs have been seriously in error one recent study estimates that purpa is costing electricity consumers nearly 8 billion a year in excess power costs since over 60 percent of purpa contracts will not expire until after the year 2010 consumers will continue to pay these excess costs well into the future purpa also stands in the way of a more competitive electric industry by granting special status to some electricity generators but not others purpa encourages the creation of uneconomic projects just to qualify for purpa benefits moreover purpa was premised on utilities continuing to be the exclusive suppliers of electricity to all consumers within their franchise territories in many states today customers have the ability to choose their own electric supplier requiring utilities to purchase new purpa power when they may no longer have retail customers to whom they can resell power makes no sense with 20 years of experience behind us it is clear that purpa has outlived its usefulness my legislation would do three things to reform purpa 1 it would prospectively repeal purpas mandatory purchase obligation on the date of enactment so that there would no longer be any new obligations to purchase this power 2 it would respect the sanctity of existing purpa contracts and 3 it would ensure that purchasing utilities would continue to be permitted to recover the costs of existing purpa contracts as long as these contracts are in effect as i said upon introduction of virtually identical legislation during the last two congresses my only interest in introducing this bill lies in achieving the most efficient and most costeffective means of electric generation for americas consumers while it would prospectively repeal purpa and would ensure that no new purpa contracts would be required it recognizes the legitimate current expectations of qf developers and utility purchasers i believe that it represents a broad based consensus on this important issue and i would urge that this measure be included in whatever electric industry

now be preparing his fifth war this time against montenegro and its democratic reformist government milosevic has run an authoritarian state suppressing dissent threatening his opponents purging the army and police and manipulating the electronic media to misinform the serbian public but in spite of all of that yesterdays dramatic election results from belgrade show the serbian people have had quite enough of slobodan milosevic it is clear from the independent and opposition sources that the democratic opposition of serbia has won a decisive victory the center for free election and democracy has reported that serbias democratic opposition has won 58 percent of the votes cast as compared to 32 percent for milosevic milosevic should respect the wishes of the serbian people and step down no manipulating or manufacturing of ballots from kosovo or montenegro no fiddling with the constitution to stay in power through next summer no desperate moves of violence against montenegro

act supports the democratic opposition by authorizing 50 million for promoting democracy and civil society in serbia and 55 million for assisting the government of montenegro it also authorizes increased broadcasting to yugoslavia by the voice of america and by radio free europe and radio liberty the acts strength is that it follows the strong and effective policy crafted by the administration and the demonstrated will of the serbian people themselves as evidenced by yesterdays vote the legislation codifies the socalled outer wall of sanctions against yugoslavia by multilateral organizations including international financial institutions it also authorizes other measures against yugoslavia including blocking yugoslavias assets in the united states prohibiting the issuance of visas and admission to the united states and prohibiting strategic exports to yugoslavia loans and investment and militarytomilitary cooperation it is important to note that yesterdays
