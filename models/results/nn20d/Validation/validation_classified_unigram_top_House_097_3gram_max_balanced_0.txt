the madison library in 1970 the congress revised that to 90 million in 1976 we raised it to 123 million in 1978 we raised it to 130 million and now in 1982 we are asked to raise it again to 139 2 million i was chairman of the subcommittee on public buildings and grounds in 1978 when the authorization for this project was last considered given the past history of cost overruns for the project we scrutinized what was then a request for an additional 10 million i worked very closely on this matter with my colleague the sinceretired ranking minority member of the subcommittee the honorable bill walsh of new york we both felt that the request before us has to be trimmed to only those items for which the architect of the capitol had been able to show specific justification accordingly we reduced the request to 7 67 million and furthermore both mr walsh and i felt it was imperative that we put all concerned on notice that this would be the last request which would be permitted and that those managing the project should conduct their business accordingly we made our position very clear in marking up this legislation in subcommittee in 1978 mr walsh stated first i want it stated in the record and understood in this committee thatthis is the last request for funds that i would participate in for this project i would hope that in the future those people associated with this project can be more costconscious and this committee will exerce tighter control in order to prevent such cost overruns as we have experienced in this project i added my own commitment let it be clearly understood by all parties involved in this project that this is in fact the last request i will not go back on that commitment today this authorization is not required the request today is for an additional 8 5 million to settle contractor delay claims against the architect of the capitol i have no idea whether such claims are justified or not but they are best adjudicated through the normal court of claims process if they are found to be justified the court of claims may order them paid without legislative authorization and if they are not justified we will have saved the taxpayer

more than advisable that the federal government be prudent in deciding which projects merit investment an important consideration should be the ability of a federal project to pay for itself and generate much needed federal state and local revenues federal reclamation projects are good examples of such wise investments since the 1902 reclamation act was approved by congress and projects subsequently developed western water and power users have paid back about 85 percent of all the costs to the federal government in addition investments in federal reclamation projects have returned tremendous amounts to the unitedstates treasury in the form of taxes from 1940 to 1978 for example western water projects generated about 25 6 billion in federal tax revenuesin 1978 alone 8 6 billion was generated in personal income in fact the central valley project generated 418 5 million in federal state and local taxes in 1978 and was responsible for 2 689 billion in agricultural production these figures are indicative of the huge benefit reaped by the entire nation as a result of federal reclamation projects to make a statement therefore that federal water projects are wasteful arnd economically unsound is not accurate a recent study done by j gorden milliken senior research economist for the deliver research institute at the university of denver proves this out utilizing an analytical framework incorporating economic outputs from reclamation including physical products water and energy service recreation and the economic output of spending it was determined that federal reclamation projects do pay their own way in particular the cvi was cited as a specific example of this type of sound economic investment i would like to submit dr millikens findings to the record i believe that his research sheds a great deal of light on this important issue do water projects pay tuii way fortunei magazine on february 23 1981 published another example of a long series of articles attacking water projects as waste ful and economicaliy unsound the author rehashing ancient arguments attempted to expose federal reclamation projects notably the central valley project in california as favored treatment at the expense of taxpayers elsewhere in the unitedstates she states that the federal water bonanza is undoubtedly huge and that subsidies moreover are a needless drain on the federal government when it is running huge deficits i dont intend today to comment further on that article but instead to try explore the question do water projects pay their way a few years ago our institute was asked to develop an economic methodology for estiinating the national economic impacts of the federal reclamation program we ultimately devised a method that is we believe conservative and credible and that provides accurate quantitative estimates of the direct and indirect economic impacts attributable to a multiple purpose water development project a systematic methodology was designed to trace the direct and firstround indirect impacts of six basic outputs from reclamation projects and to collect and categorize these impacts into significant measures of economic activity k we chose not to include the income and employment multiplier effects of second round and subsequent rounds of spending that are very in portant to the regional and local economies but are difficult to justify from a national viewpoint the methodology utilizes data from six basic project output measures available annually from normal reporting channels direct agency spending net crop output from agricultural irrigation municipal water industrial water hydroelectric power and recreation from these data sources economic impacts are traced through the national economy expenditure profiles which convert receipts into wages profits and purchased inputs were developed suppliers were subdivided into retail wholesale and manufacturing sectors so that financial characteristics typical of each sector could be used in the analysis the methodology generates several economic measures in presented at the spring conference association of california water agencies

other public issues what was said with particular decency directness and grace was that few people have the effective freedom and the opportunity to say it all necessities aside i dont believe it is only because you are about to be leaving congress that you said it there are many who have left who have kept a discreet silence it takes substance to have thought to say it that way to begin with no
