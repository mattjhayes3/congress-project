ryan i dont give the president total credit for all of this he couldnt do it by himself you have to have a rubber stamp congress to give you full power full power to be able to take the country down the track it has gone down and the bottom line is that a republican majority from the leadership on down to the newly elected member of the republican conference has to take credit for giving the president the kind of power that he has right now we are fighting wars abroad for democracy when here at home we dont celebrate that very democracy that so many people speak of we have individuals that are on their third and fourth deployment i am on the armed services committee so i get the reports i get the letters from my constituents saying my husband my wife my mother my dad my niece my uncle my nextdoor neighboris on his way back to iraq again abec se we went alone we didnt go with a true coalition so i think it would be hard if i was a part of the republican majority to try to muster up some talking points for the floor right now to be able to say well okay some of this stuff is not believable so lets try to attack some members of the democratic caucus lets try to muster up and embellisha record on possibly being weak on terrorism or being weak on national security thats where the republican majority is now they are gasping for political air right now but you know what is so important about this issue and this discussion about national security is that it is supposed to be nonpolitical and unfortunately it is and that is because the majority hasnt allowed bipartisanship in this house for so many years and so they can hang it around their neck and say it is our war it is our failure as it relates to national security and border security dont act like it is a crisis right now you allowed it to happen under your watch you have been the rubber stamp congress now mr ryan and ms wasserman schultz let me just tell you what the rubber stamp congress has accomplished borrowing 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 4 years in more than 224 years of this countrys history with 42 presidents 1 01 trillion they were able to borrow in 4 years and this republican congress and the president has allowed that to happen these are the countries here that own a part of the american apple pie japan china the u k the caribbean taiwan germany and opec nations you know this whole oil thing that we will talk about in a minute korea and canada they all have their hands in the pockets of the unitedstates taxpayers not because of the unitedstates taxpayers but because of the republican majoritys outofcontrol spending oil companies oh wow at this time in history when they unearth what happened under this republican majority and this presidency they will see these record breaking profits there was a meeting in the white house i have the article to prove it and i talk about it all time it was a special meeting that took place in the white house and the vice presidents aides and all met and then the policymakers came here to the congress to the rubber stamp congress now let me set this up here because we believe in the 30something working group in thirdparty validators washington post wednesday november 16 2005 white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long expected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by the white house last week industry officials testified before congress document obtained by the post on november 2005 shows that officials from exxon mobil phillips shell oil companies and bp of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides to develop a national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated in congress that was 2001 look what happened 2002 34 billion recordbreaking profits 2003 53 billion 2004 84 billion 2005 113 billion in profits for oil companies meanwhile average americans are spending through the nose and trying to make it to work and to drop their kids off look what happened here this is what happened under the republican majority and a rubber stamp congress so shall it be written and so shall it be done e85 we talk about alternative fuels flex vehicles every magazine i open talks about flex vehicles here is the bottom line the republican congress have allowed these oil companies to be able to do anything they want to do when they want to do it this is an actual pump here at an exxonmobil station it says you cannot use your mobil credit card to buy e85 meanwhile we can continue to feed off the saudi arabian middle east what got us in this thing in the first place policies you can use your oil card there you can buy a bag of chips you can buy a carton cigarettes but e85 that is produced in the midwest versus the middle east you cannot use your mobil credit card for that and on retirement packages and i dont know very much about lee raymond but the bottom line is he is a retired executive from exxonmobil with a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break this is what happens with a republican majority again the republican majority rubber stamp dont worry about balancing the budget democrats we tried to balance the budget we have done it before we have tried to do it under this republican majority not one republican vote to balance the budget on rollcall vote 87 march 17 2005 ranking member spratt and the budget committee put it forth again failed not one republican vote on rollcall vote 91 in 2004 their will and desire is not there the american people deserve balance minimum wage yes there was some bill that came up before we left for the break to talk about minimum wage a bill that the republican majority knew that the senate would not take up and would never make it to the presidents desk but because we were hammering them on it they said lets pass this they added all kinds of stuff it is called the potomac twostep this chart the bottom line is these are not minimum wage increases these are increases for members of congress this is our pay this is what we make oh look at them since 1997 there hasnt been an increase in the minimum wage and you not a minimum wage worker right now and i am not talking to the members of congress i am talking to the american people the bottom line is if the minimum wage goes up and that means if you are a salaried worker then your wages will go up but the bottom line is that it is a fact that the republican congress has said not over our dead body we are going to get our increase but we are not going to give the american people a minimum wage increase it goes on and on and on i am going to close with this the prime minister of iraq and the president of iran mr delahunt brought this picture out last night i dont care whichever way you cut 300 billion of spending over 2 000 troops thousands and thousands of american troops injured here in washington d c stay the course no plan the secretary of defense says if you talk about or say anything about redeployment of troops or withdrawing from iraq you are fired no question from the congress no response from the congress the secretary of defense is not called to the hill immediately the republican congress what are they saying they are saying nothing so accountability is not there they are embracing and guess what this is a la the unitedstates taxpayer through the republican majority because of a lack of diplomacy and a lack of plan and going to a war of choice versus after osama bin laden in afghanistan andgiving those troops in afghanistan the support they need so ms wasserman schultz mr ryan i rest my case the bottom line is that was not a message for democrats or republicans it was not a message for independents or the green party or other party affiliations that is a message for americans the bottom line is whatever you may feel if you are a member of the republican executive committee or you have always voted republican or you always voted independent you have to have issues with what the facts are i yield to ms wasserman schultz"],

to share with the members what we are doing right and what we are doing wrong so many times we focus on this side of the aisle on the plans that we have here on the democratic side of the aisle inhelping americans to continue to prosper need it be they are in small business or they wake up and go to work every day educating our children making sure that we have a healthy and prosperous and safe america before i get started i know mr ryan will be joining me momentarily i just want to share with the members a few plans that we have on this side of the aisle that we would like to implement the only thing that is stopping us from bringing these plans to the floor and implementing action well we are moving in the right direction with great force is the fact that we are not the majority here to be able to bring these issues to the floor as you know in the past i have talked about energy i encourage members to go to housedemocrats gov to pick up a copy of our energy agenda talking about alternative fuel talking about bringing about flex vehicles in the industry to be able to allow more americans to purchase vehicles that are flex vehicles that they can use e85 and gasoline real security plan it is there dealing with homeland security we have already said on this side of the aisle if we are in the majority that we would irplement all of the 9 11 recommendations to make america safer this is a bipartisan commission as the members know that was appointed and this house was part of it and they did outstanding work those recommendations have still not been fully implemented to protect america we have our initiative that we have been trying to promote for the last 3 to 4 months in a very forceful way which is allowing working americans to be able to earn more money it has been 9 years since the american people have received an increase as it relates to the minimum wage it is very very unfortunate that we have americans that are working for 5 15 an hour the minimum wage has been the same since 1997 which is now approaching 10 years as you know many americans have suffered under the low minimum wage that we have now that is throughout for individuals that are working every day and i have a few facts here of the last 50years i mean this is the lowest it has been in the last 50 years also 6 6 million americans will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage and something that i must add the republican leadership has said that they vow not to raise the minimum wage again this year or next year so i think that is something that the american people need to pay very close attention to threequarters of the minimum wage workers are adults that are over the age of 20 many of whom are responsible for over half of the familys income one day of work it takes an entire days wage for an earner to buy a tank of gas also studies have shown that zero jobs have been lost when the minimum wage has been increased eightysix percent of americans do support an increase in the minimum wage twentyone states have moved in the direction of increasing the minimum wage i do not know what is going on here with the republican majority in not moving in that direction to allow more american people to have money in their pocket to be able to provide for their families we havetalked many times on this floor in the 30something workifg group about the new weight that has been placed on the heads of the american people as they start to send their young people to college li 1730 just yesterday we had a town hall meeting downstairs in this building in hc5 here in the capitol building with some young people who are thirdparty validators with the student loans they have out now and this is very serious because now people are starting to prepare their young people to go off to college in the month of august and late july many of whom are now having to take out these student loans at a very high interest rate they are going to end up paying almost 100 more a month in interest to pay for their college and i think that is something we need to pay very close attention to it is very unfortunate that on the majority side on the republican side all due respect to all the innovation that one tries to come up with on the other side of the aisle it is costing the american people more and it is putting our young people in debt in this country even before they can grab their college degree and earn a living they are already on average somewhere around 25 000 or 30 000 in debt when they step across the stage that is very very unfortunate we cut student aid here we increase student loan rates here the states in turn have to cut and the cost of college is increased it increases on these individuals it is an increase on these individuals i think it is also important mr speaker for us to talk about the fact that we have the will and the desire on this side of the aisle to move america in the right direction i talked about this last week and i think it is very very important to bring this up here again today that we are willing to move this country in the right direction in a new direction making sure that americans have more opportunities i think it is important for us to point out the fact that on this side of the aisle we have committed again to raising the minimum wage we have committed to helping this country become energy independent investing in the midwest versus the middle east within 10 years we have also committed on this side of the aisle i mentioned it earlier to implementing all of the 9 11 recommendations but one of our major commitments on this side and also to the american people is that we have said that we are willing to bring this budget back into balance within a reasonable time not that we are going to cut the deficit in half or we are going to balance the budget but we are going to be able to bring us out of this deficit spending that the republican majority has led us into with record deficits as far as the eye can see we have the resume on our resume we have the accomplishment of being able to do that we have accomplished that before in the past and i think it is something that one needs to pay very close attention to when we say a commitment to making sure our fiscal house is in order it is not a slogan it is not something that someone says well the polls say you need to say you are going to bring spending under control we have actually attempted to do that you have seen this chart before we cant talk about it enough because the facts are in regardless of the floor speeches that may go on on the republican side of the aisle i think it is important for us to outline the fact that we have put our legislation where our mouths are we have said that we want to see this house say that if you are going to spend then spend in a way that almost every american family has to spend if you are going to buy something you have to know how you are going to pay for it you cant put everything on a credit card and what is unfortunate is that we have allowed other countries to be a part of our country financially not because the american people have made a bad decision but it is because the majority and the white house have made some bad decisions here i have a paygo rule that on this side we have adopted that we are willing to pay as we go if you are going to buy it you have to show how you are going to pay for it it is not that you spend or you buy and then you borrow john spratt who is the ranking member on the budget committee on the 2006 budget resolution and this is the congressional record this is not something the 30something working group put together this is rollcall vote 87 march 17 of 2005 republicans voted 228 against this payasyougo amendment that we put forward again mr sprat and the ranking members substitute amendment to house concurrent resolution 393 this is also rollcall vote number 91 march 25 2004 224 republicans voting against payasyougo on a rule we tried to put in place when i say try that is all we can do at this particular point because until democrats are in the majority we are not going to be able to put this country into the fiscal position it should be in once again and i do say once again i pull my chart out this is almost my exhibit a here thirdparty validator and the source that has given us this information happens to be the unitedstates department of the treasury here we show that 42 presidents over 224 years were only able to borrow from foreign nations and this is money that the united states has borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years and 42 presidents 1 01 trillion through world war i world war ii the great depression a number of other conflicts slowdowns in the economy and other issues that have faced this country 42 presidents have only borrowed 1 01 trillion in 4 years 4 years with president bush 1 05 trillion with the republican congress just in 4 years if someone came to me and said kendrick you have to throw all the charts out but one if you just wanted one chart this would be the one that i would pick because i think it reveals what has happened here in this house how it has been so easy for the republican majority to put runaway spending on a credit card and allowed foreign countries to be able to own a part of the american apple pie what is so very very unfortunate here as all of this borrowing has taken place you would think that student loans would have a lower interest rate you would think that alternative fuels would have an opportunity to be a part of the marketplace and that we would be moving towards more cleanerburning fuel you would think that we would have a worldclass health care system and that companies as big as general motors and as small as a momandpop store that has five or six employees in it would be able to provide health care for their employees and you would also think that a number of states would not be suing the federal government because of the underfunding of the leave no child behind with all of the money that has been borrowed from foreign nations but what has happened is that the superwealthy in this country have gotten the biggest tax cut inf the history of the republic what has also happened is that republicans have been allowed to spend in recordbreaking i mean just off the charts for republicans to come down here and blame democrats for spendingi mean really i know it is kind of hard for them to keep eye contact with someone like me and those of us in the 30something group who knows better who know what the facts show that 1 05 trillion has been borrowed from foreign countries they are weakening our country as they start to move and allow these other countries to be able to own so much of the american apple pie and i will close with this before i yield to ms wasserman schultz who came in before mr ryan i think it is important for us to look at it from this standpoint that if you borrow money from someone the relationship has changed i heard someone from the white house say this morning on the today show we are the last standing superpower okay well you must be talking about militarily because financially we are getting weaker every day under this administrations policy and the rubberstamping of this republican congress i think it is important that everyone understands that we have borrowed money from countries that we have never borrowed money from before in a recordbreaking way the republican majority has done so without our help but because they are in the majority that has happened and now they are looking at us under a different light we still have budgets that are being passed here on this floor that is going to even make the american people more indebted to foreign nations some that we have questions of their links to possible terrorism and other questionable measures with that i would like to yield to ms wasserman schultz"],

stamp and it is very very unfortunate that the people that are paying the price for this rubber stamp are the american people at the gas pump this is graduation time a lot of parents are going to see their children walk across the stage but guess what college assistance and affordable loans will not be there for those children because we are willing to give 42 000 43 000 in tax breaks to

consider themselves millionaires i am holding this rubber stamp because this is what got us here mr ryan talks about paying for that let us put that rubber stamp over here how we are paying for it is we are making history in all the wrong places 224 years 1 01 trillion borrowed over 224year 42 presidents combined 1 01 trillion the republican congress and president bush he could not do it without

increasing from 1 trillion to 2 1 trillion meaning that this administration has already accrued more foreign debt than the previous 42 presidents combined let me repeat that this president and this republicanled congress has borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors than the previous 42 presidents combined as you can see here in 2001 the amount of money borrowed from foreign central banks and from foreign investors was 988 billion that was troubling enough in 2006 we are up to 2 66 trillion that has been borrowed from foreigners unlike deficits in earlier years current deficits have been primarily financed by foreign investors with the rise in foreignheld debt equaling threefourths the increase in publiclyheld debt since the start of the current administration in 2001 this rise in foreignheld debt is troubling because it makes our econormy beholden to foreign creditors and represents another financial burden passed on to future generations foreignheld debt is fundamentally different from domesticallyheld debt since the interest payments on foreignheld debt flow outside the united states of america and reduce americans standard of living the cost of servicing foreignheld debt is high local state and federal government interest rates to foreign investors totaled 114 billion in 2005 an amount that will grow rapidly if the treasury continues to sell debt to foreign investors at the current rate compare this to only 23 billion in foreign holdings in 1993 today the debt the foreignheld debt is 2 1 trillion and just like david letterman i have got a top ten list the top ten current lenders again our government is borrowing 1 billion a day we keep passing tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year and where does the

that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure

federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and

his as always excellent leadership on behalf of the middleclass working families in america i salute him for his excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford president bush and the republicans it is time for a new direction we can begin by rejecting this estate tax giveaway to the wealthy and insist on a vote to increase the minimum wage that would be a real values judgment"], [0.11382937431335449, 0.8861706256866455, 1, "i rise tonight to highlight how the presidents fiscal year 2007 budget will harm millions of women and children around the country tonight you are going to hear from some of my colleagues about those specific programs that have proven to be successful for all women but are currently being cut and in some cases eliminated altogether the president is proposing to cut programs that disproportionately help women children the elderly and the increasing population of americans living in poverty earlier this month i was part of a recent delegation of members of congress who traveled to the gulf coast and new orleans where most communities are still struggling to clean up their homes and get back to sorme sense of normalcy after hurricane katrina we need to be doing more to help those those that lost everything to regain their lives these communities must have quality health care emergency care and safe environmental conditions but we cannot accomplish these goals and help the millions of women and children around the country who are living in poverty with the reckless and immoral budget that president bush has proposed key domestic programs that provide food and housing and support to women are vulnerable under this administration in fact the bush administration is determined to protect tax cuts for the very wealthiest of americans and provide health care for those who already have health care coverage and not include the 50 million uninsured people in our country today the president wants to eliminate educational support for women food assistance for seniors living in poverty and he wants to significantly slash funding from important safety net programs like medicaid and food stamps in just 4 years the cost of making these tax cuts permanent will exceed the amount that the federal government spends on education beginning in preschool through college where is the economic recovery that the administration promised real wages as we know are down the number of people living in poverty has increased job growth has been stagnant and tonight i am glad that so many of our colleagues ijn our congress the womens democratic congress who serve here are coming together to speak out against the presidents budget and how it is going in the wrong direction for women and their families i would like to begin by talking about education but first i would like to begin by addressing the presidents failure to address rising college costs with increased funding for student financial aid programs like the pell grant program and the perkins loan program before my election to public office i worked for the california student opportunity and access program and helped many young people in my community obtain the ideal of going to college and receiving financial aid because there was no other means to go to college the presidents budget currently continues to shortchange americas students who rely on financial aid to pursue their college education just one month after congressional republicans cut college aid by 12 billion 12 billion the president proposed a budget that eliminates decreases and freezes funding for much needed programs that are vital to helping students of color people from my own community low interest perkins loans are crucial resources as we know for college students who have demonstrated need twothirds of the perkins loan recipients are from families with annual incomes less than 40 000 a year yet the perkins loan program took a hit in the presidents 2007 budget and would recall 664 million from the federal perkins loan fund for nearly 1 800 colleges in the year 2007 and as a result 463 000 college students would lose a key part of their financial aid despite the record tuition increases that we all know are going through in our states bushs budget breaks his promise yet again of making college more affordable and he actually freezes the maximum pell grant in scholarships six years ago president bush promised to increase the maximum pell scholarship for all college freshmen at 5 100 fl 2100 this budget is now the fourth time that the president has frozen the pell grant access to financial aid as we know is a huge factor for many students particularly from lowincome areas like my own three out of four young latino adults who do not attend college cite the fact that without having financial aid they cannot continue to have the american dream about 40 percent of african american students and 30 percent of hispanic students depend on pell grants compared to 23 percent of all students young women just trying to improve their earning potential and get a better job also disproportionately rely on the pell grant program and i have to tell you when i was a student that was my means of going on to college my parents could not afford to send me to college they could not afford to give me a substantial amount of money to go to a university so thank god that we had federal financial aid programs available work study programs and the national student loan pro ram where i was able to attend a 4year institution to have my full tuition paid for including expenses and i thank god that our government at that time stepped up to the plate i cannot say that now under this administration but for the last 4 years now we have seen an increase of 57 percent in costs to attend college by this president we need to reject the presidents freezes and cuts to financial aid and help those students who want to go to college but the high cost of tuition is just way out of line when these students get to college we need to do more to encourage them to pursue fields that will encourage innovation and increase americas competitiveness and increase the number of women that seek access into the technical fields like science and math while women account for more than half of the number of bachelors and masters degrees awarded they make up a small number in the fields that are crucial to spurring innovation and job creation for example in areas like engineering computer science physical sciences and math only 21 percent of masters degrees in engineering were awarded to women for computer science and physical science women only eard about 35 percent of the masters degrees in the country the statistics are far worse for women of color like latinas and african american women and even asian americans within the small number of women who earn an engineering masters degree 11 percent are asian american a little over 4 percent are african american and less than 4 percent are latinas we need to encourage women to be part of the technical and skilled work force from school age all the way up to adulthood the presidents budget also eliminates the dropout prevention program and therefore ignores the big problem that we have currently in many of our communities where we see a number of our students dropping out of high school for the past 4 years the bush administration has cut funding for dropout prevention denying our mostneeded students the opportunity to succeed and in los angeles by the way only 29 percent of latinos and 47 percent of african americans actually graduate from high school this budget also freezes over 1 billion in current funding for ongoing programs including the gear up program the trio and upward bound program which are vital programs to many youngsters in our community many that attend and currently are enrolled in those programs are the first in their family to have the opportunity to be trained and have the motivation and support and mentoring that is needed to be successful in college with the president saying that he wants to zero out these programs he is sending the wrong message to my community and to communities across this country we need to beencouraging all of our young people to pursue higher education to keep america competitiv6 and to increase our productivity and economy with deep cuts to student aid proposed by the president we are closing the doors to eager students instead of providing a helping hand to those who want to learn who want to work and want to be a part of the society we must defeat this immoral budget to help our students achieve their goals and access all the opportunities that our nation can provide i would like to briefly speak about women in tfhe workforce once these young women who complete college graduate they face challenges in the workforce the wage gap among women and men continues to this day some of you may know that women earn on an average 76 cents to every dollar that a man earns instead of eliminating the wage gap and providing more opportunities for women to enter the workforce and earn good wages the bush budget continues to undercut and devalue womens contributions to the american labor force the bush budget eliminates the women in apprenticeships and nontraditional occupational programs this program which only costs 1 million per year provides grants to employers to help them recruit train and retain women in nontraditional and wellpaying jobs women who were a part of women in apprenticeship and nontraditional occupations projects were 47 percent more likely to enter higherpaying technical jobs than others the overwhelming lack of women in technical fields like science and math as you know is astounding even if women graduate with engineering and science and math degrees they are still faced with low salaries on the average women hold ph d s in computer science and engineering but still earn 9 000 less per year than their male counterparts latino engineers both men and women earn 10 000 less than the average salary for all engineers and african american engineers earn 8 000 less we need to encourage women to be a part of the technical and skilled workforce from school age right up to adulthood programs like women in apprenticeshlip and nontraditional occupations act are a part of that effort and i will work in congress along with my colleagues to reject the elimination of this or any other programs that help women achieve their dreams and realize their potential to be an important component of the technical workforce from the wage gap to discrimination we need to do more to help women succeed and support this vital and necessary part of the american workforce i urge all of my colleagues here today and tonight to do everything possible to defeat the presidents immoral and irresponsible budget that puts women and childrens futures at risk i would now like to introduce one of my colleagues who has joined me tonight who is also part of the womens issues group here in the

today with a budget that is squarely not responsive nor responsible to the needs of the american people with an administration that quite frankly on so many important issues has demonstrated that they are completely out to lunch and out of touch the point is that the american people deserve better there is a day of reckoning coming and i assure you that that reckoning is coming this year in the year 2006 i think this is going to be one of the most important elections that we have had in a long long time because all of the facts that you have just pointed out in terms of fema in terms of what is happening in the middle east and here lately in terms of those who were asleep at the switch when the deal was cut in terms of the port security all show a considerable lack of judgment and a lack of responsibility to the american people that has been a characteristic within this administration especially in the area dealing with one of the most precious responsibilities we have which is determining and being responsible for how we spend the taxpayers money for this administration in the last 5 years to have squandered a surplus the facts are there they are plain as one can see when the clinton administration left office there was a surplus of billions and billions of dollars and now in this last year the deficit has been shot up over 4 trillion there is a reckoning for that and i am here to tell you that as a member of congress the american people are looking for members of congress to stand up for them and to do what it is we need to do that we were elected to do it is congress that is charged with the responsibility of oversight it is congress whose decision it is by the constitution to determine how the tax dollars are spent that is our responsibility i am here to

their heads how are we going to pay this without money they do not have the luxury of putting out a debt ceiling they do not have the luxury of going and borrowing unlimited amounts from foreign governments for our most basic services when you combine that with the trade deficit and you combine that with our willingness to turn our security for our ports over to foreign countries and especially countries with arab and islamic roots and connections when we are in a terrorist war with islamic and arabic countries let it be said and let it be plain we do not wish to discriminate against anybody because you are arab or islamic but does it make good judgment to turn our security over to a country that has had a record of financial transactions supporting terrorists or a country where two of the terrorists came from that attacked this country that is sort of like after the bombing of pearl harbor turning over the security of pearl harbor to the japanese the only reason i am mentioning that is to show that the same mindset that allowed this to happen for our ports the same mindset that allowed the fema to happen to have those trailers setting up unused in hope arkansas at

rebels in the south claimed the lives of over 2 million people and was punctuated by brutalities that strain our credulity the united states poured hundreds of millions of dollars into humanitarian relief for sudan but never bothered to effectively engage in a highlevel effort to resolve the conflict until 2001 when president bush appointed senator john danforth to serve as a special envoy to sudan with senator danforths leadership the comprehensive peace agreement for sudan was signed in january of 2005 presenting a historic opportunity for peace economic development and democratic aspirations in southern sudan unfortunately implementation of the peace agreement has been slow and many difficult challenges lie ahead while the international community focused on resolving the war in the south a genocidal campaign was unleashed by the government of sudan in the darfur region of western sudan as many as 400 000 people have died since 2004 and more than 2 million others have been forced from their homes once again the unitedstates government provided millions of dollars to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of those most affected by the conflict including more than 150 million to support the deployment and operations of the african union peacekeepers in darfur this time however the unitedstates immediately engaged at the highest levels to seek a resolution to the conflict two years of intense negotiations with significant engagement by president bush himself finally yielded a peace agreement between the government of sudan and the largest rebel faction in darfur the sla in may of this year unfortunately the agreement has not held and the sudanese government has launched military operations against its own civilian population in darfur the united states has significant human rights and security interests at stake in sudan recall that in 1996 the sudanese government made osama bin laden available to american law enforcement officials a point that salah gosh reiterated to me with a great deal of sarcasm when i met with him 14 months ago in khartoum that offer as we know was refused we cannotafford to repeat those mistakes of the past the united states needs a rational well coordinated policy towards sudan that puts an end to the violence and terrorism and human rights abuses at the core of our relationship it is in this context that i welcome and we welcome as a body the presidents appointment of andrew natsios to serve as the presidential envoy for sudan the resolution before us today authored by our good friend and colleague chairman frank wolf h res 992 strongly supports the appointment of the special envoy for sudan and suggests a roadmap for the formation of a comprehensive responsible policy towards sudan it states that the special envoys mandate should include all efforts to consolidate peace throughout sudan including by ensuring full implementation of the darfur peace agreement and the comprehensive peace agreement the mandate should also include helping to secure a just and equitable peace in eastern sudan supporting reconstruction efforts and the return of displaced persons to the darfur and southern sudan and addressing the inextricably linked conflict in northern uganda in essence what will be the special envoys responsibility to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past by focusing solely on the crisis in darfur at the expense of solidifying the northsouth peace accord and resolving the conflict in the east by allowing the potential for peace in southern sudan to blind us to the grave human rights tragedies continuing to unfold in darfur and by allowing the government of sudans reported cooperation in the war on terror to outweigh human rights concerns in the region they must be paramount and also to allow those same human rights concerns to compromise our ability to protect our own citizens again this is a good resolution i would note parenthetically that originally it

proposing to build a medium security federal correctional institution in mendota california the required environmental impact study followed after which mendota was selected the local elected officials and community leaders have been strong supporters of the project proud to provide a public service to the country and encouraged by the economic stimulus the prison would create the demand for such a prison is imperative and the mendota facility will provide much needed bed space for 1 152 mediumsecurity male inmates with crowding at mediumsecurity facilities currently 37 percent over
