decades they have always been working mothers women have shaped the lives of all past leaders whether it be as wives mothers or colleagues it is time that women are recognized for the roles they have fulfilled as the equals of men the era deals with economics and civil rightsnot with afestyles as many of its opponents suggest this is a basic issue to protect the rights of women in situations such

phase of the commodity credit corporation bill i support the concept and the idea of the commodity credit corporation and i support the needs that they have today for the 5 billion the question i am raisingand i would have raised on an amendment if it had been possibleis the fact that most members in this house as i did assumed that when loans were made for commodities to the agricultural community that interest would be paid on these loans because the commodity credit corporation states that interest muft be paid at the current rate in fact what happens is that if a crop or a commodity be it dairy or any other product that comes under this is forfeited then the practice now is that no interest would be paid the commodity credit corporation clearly shows in its statement to the appropriations committee that they lost in 1981 1 578 000 000 in unpaid interest because the commodity credit corporation must pay interest to this money to the treasury department from which they borrowed so they end up in a situation that no user of the money is paying interest in this particular factor now you have to realize that we are talking about appropriating more money today than the department of energy gets the entire department of energy the justice department more money for the b1 bomber the mx missile military construction any of these items i am mentioning all of them get less money than we are appropriating today for the commodity credit corporation this gets into community development block grants urban development rural development programs economic development administration and an endless list it seems to me that when an agriculture commodity is placed in loan if that loan is forfeited at least 9percent interest should be paid at the end of the period and i use 9 percent because that is the amount of money that is paid by a guaranteed student loan a student in college must pay that 9 percent now i would still leave the secretary of agriculture the right of dliscretion of charging the additional what today would be 5 percent bringing it up to the 14percent level now that is the situation that we have in front of us we have the commodity credit lending money out as against when they take crops in and at the end of a period if there is a forfeiture we keep the crops which is a loss to us at that point and no interest is paid on the loan
