heard tonight ireland today stands divided it stands divided at a time when the rest of the world seems to be moving together the iron curtain has fallen as has the berlin wall jews and arabs in the middle east are coming together and whites and blacks in south africa are moving toward peace and democracy although as we have heard in recent weeks there will be setbacks along the way but even with

ireland were not strong but today after the issuance of the joint declaration of peace by prime ministers reynolds and major in december and developments over the last few months i think most

photographers would always have bill there he took those sessions very seriously i think the gentlewoman has risen to a particularly lofty state in her first term by being considered the gentlemans

unfortunate has been happening related to the nafta issue it has become a lightning rod for everyone who has something that troubles them we have members of congress who are unfortunately not looking at the agreement in the depth they should we have misinformation about it that is almost incalculable and what we need to have instead is a little leadership from members of congress who examine the issue and then try to avoid feeding the fears of those constituents who are understandably concerned about a potential loss of their jobs many americans simply do not like the way the world is goirg they say stop the world i want to get off but each time on each issue cr provisions in nafta we need to look at it and ask are you better off wish the statue quo or with the changes offered by nafta are we and the mexicans better off with the mexican human rights abuses that one gentleman talked about here a few minutes ago are we better off with the status quo with the declining trade balance mentioned by the gentlewoman from connecticut a few minutes ago or with the improvements offered by nafta are we better off with the loss of those jobs at zenith and other firms mentioned by the gentlelady from illinois under the status quo or are you better off with the reductions of mexican tariffs under nafta almost without exception in fact without exception as far as i have been able to discern yet amerlca will be better off with nafta instead of the status quo you are better off making the changes we are said to have a reduced trade surplus with mexico today under current tariffs we need for example to eliminate it to reduce those mexican tariffs which are on average nearly three times as high as our own reducing those mexican tariffs is a step in the right direction opponents of nafta also say it is not an agreement on trade but an agreement on investment in that regard they are partially right nafta is both an agreement on trade and investment opponents of te north american freetrade agreement claim that its rules on investment will send united states factories and jobs to mexico in that regard they are not even half right they are dead wrong apparently they are urappy withthe status quo and so am i that is why we nmt grasp the array of positive changes offered by nafta the biggest myth surrounding debate over the north american freetrade agreement is that congress or the president can stop the loss of unitedstates jobs to the developkig world congress or even the president cannot and ahould not dictate where americans invest their money and it they choose to invwt overseas then that is where many jobs will be created americans opposed to nafta might be surprised to find their pensions being invested in southeast asia south america or yes mexico for that matter american companies are voting with their pocketbooks and their investing their retirement savings in the developing world uke it of not the unitedstates congross cannot stop the american public from investing their retrerment savings in a shoe factory in china or a widget maker in mexico once congress and the american people understand that important mality we can pass the north american freetrade agreement and get to work on issms like taxes regulativn infrastructure and technology in the meantime we must approve nafta to increase jobs by reducing mexican trade barriers tariffs quotas and nontariff barriers to open up large mexican mafets these are proper actions america must take to keep jobs in the united statesnot my defeating nafta"]]}
