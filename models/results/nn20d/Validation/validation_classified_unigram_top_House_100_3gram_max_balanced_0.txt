each of us can find items which we favor as well as oppose such is the nature of omnibus tax bills our task in these situations it to make a judgment as to whether the good parts outweigh the provisions which we oppose in this situation i feel this bill overall is worthy of our support i say this because of two provisions in particular one is the repeal of the socalled heifer tax which has imposed an unfair burden on millions of farmers in wisconsin and across the country i am a sponsor of a bill to repeal this tax and this bill includes a provision which accomplishes the purpose of my original proposal enactment of this bill will save farmers not only from having to pay added taxes solely as a result of a federally imposed accounting system that does not reflect the true costs incurred in raising livestock to production moreover it ends a paperwork nightmare for farmers many of whom have appealed to me for relief this repeal strikes a blow for the family farmer similarly the final bill includes a repeal of a totally inappropriate requirement that farmers and other offroad users of diesel fuel pay a tax they do not owe and then file for a refund this is simply wrong and i proposed months ago that this be repealed the bill follows my recommendation as we wind up the 100th congress it is fitting that we enact this tax corrections bill it fixes many of the problems

new york times called it the most exteme case of creditrepair abuse ever uncovered july 23 1988 what is happening in america to allow such fraudulent business to prosper the root of the problem is americans dependence on credit the charge card has virtually replaced cash for many people unfortunately credit cards are often used unwisely in many casos debt is accumulated at a rate which cannot be repaid on time the result of course is a bad credit record bad credit records may be devastating the ability to obtain financing to purchase cars homes and or even to rent an apartment may be hampered by a bad credit history for simply forgetting to pay few bills on time an individual may be plagued with credit problems for many years credit is offered with the trust that the money will be repaid once that trust is broken a creditor will naturally be reluctant to offer more credit of course a bad credit record which is unfounded may be rectified through appealing to the reporting credit bureau however bad credit which has been properly reported will stay in ones credit file for a given period of time which may be as long as 7 years or more under the fair credit reporting act passed in 1970 consumers who are denied credit based on a credit report are entitled to have the contents of their credit file disclosed to them free of charge consumers requesting the disclosure of their file at other times may be charged a small fee by the credit bureau before the disclosure generally these fees average around 10 the act also gives consumers the right to dispute any information that is inaccurate and to include their story regarding disputed information enter credit repair clinics many of these businesses are kin to get rich quick schemes they promise fast results and newfound wealth in the form of available credit wiping the slate clean is what these credit repair clinics claim they can do yet this is not possible if the information in the credit file is correct credit repair clinics may legitimately assist individuals in contesting reports of bad credit however if the information is verifiable by the credit bureau the credit repair clinic can do nothing to change it when an item in a credit history is questioned the credit bureau has a certain period of time in which to verify the information if it is not verifiable or if the bureau is not able to take action to verify it within the allotted time the item must be removed from the credit history many of these clinics promise to fix credit histories which are irreparable further they may use the unethical tactic of bombarding a credit bureau with requests for verification with the hope that the bureau will not possibly be able to verify all of the information within the given time period it is this kind of deception and unethical practice that my bill h r 458 the credit repair organizations act is de signed to prohibit h r 458 will require that all credit repair clinics advise consumers of their rights under the fair credit reporting act before any contract is signed this bill will also require the credit repair organization to fully describe the services they will provide and give the consumer 3 days to cancel any contract between the two the legislation also prohibits credit repair clinics from making misleading statements about their services and prohibits them from counseling consumers to make misleading statements to creditors and credit bureaus i urge my colleagues to be aware of the growing problem of deceptive and fraudulent credit repair organizations making the

which we can no longer tolerate i have no doubt that our farmers and ranchers can compete with anyone anywhere in the world if given the chance the bill also address the need for export enhancement of our agricultural products through an expansion of the export enhancement program another provision which i cosponsored would limit the imports of casein another expresses the sense of congress in opposition to the establishment by the european economic community of a tax on vegetable fats and oil finally a provision of this bill would allow the speaker of the house of representatives and the majority leader of the senate to appoint members of the house and senate agriculture committees to participate in the ongoing gatt negotiations allowing farm state representatives to become directly
