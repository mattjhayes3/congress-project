revise and extend their remarks on the the home loan bank act was subject of this special order signed by president hoover ina turbulent time the campaign that would lead to roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive as ever after 50 years we still have not reached the goal of a decent safe and affordable home for

60 days notice any business that shuts down ought to give its employees more than 60 days notice but this decision should be part of the collective bargaining process it ought to be done throughout the public and private sector but that is not what should determine a vote to sustain or override the veto on this bill it ought to be on the merits of the trade bill in and of itself that my colleagues make their decisions frankly what i am concerned about is that the 60day closing provision will be deleted and we will come back and pass a bill under the name of expanding trade markets for the united states but which is protectionist and not going to expand but inhibit our markets i think that the trade bill itself should have been vetoed on the merits of the trade provisions not just plant closing provisions this is a clearcut issue of free trade versus managed trade one of my favorite headlines recently was in the washington post last week and it said joblessness dropped to 5 4 percent the trade deficit dropped then it said the speed of decline renewed fears of inflation we live in a town where good news seems to be bad for as the story went on to say the stock market declined for the third consecutive day in response to the good news of the lowest level of unemployment in 14 years now i am not suggesting things are perfect they are far from perfect for the unemployed but when good news drives markets down because people fear that the central bank of the united states is going to tighten up interest rates it shows you the type of economic thinking in this town and the case of hypochondria affecting the critics of president reagan now make no mistake about it this trade bill transfers authority from the president to the ustr i believe that any transfer of authority away from the president will have serious repercussions bocause it affects all future presidents regardless of their party one of the most serious changes in this bill is to have findings by the itc take effect unless the president directs otherwise this means that significant changes in our trade policy could take effect without the president even having to initial them i believe that the president should retain the obligation to sign all trade action emanating from the unitedstates government i would want a trade bill if the president of the united states had to initial every decision on trade because only the president has the obligation to look out for the world economy the international trade economy and the public interest of the american people i think this is a bad bill on its merits i think the plant closing provisions should be set aside and we definitely should sustain the presidents vcto of this trade bill and then tell the president mr president whether it is dukakis or bus we want a trade bill that has your initlais on every single action on internatic nal trade taken by the ustr without that type of bill i will not support trade legislation which takes authority out of the hands of the president and gives it to a trade czar threatens a world trade war retaliation and lost jobs for americans i intend to vote to sustain the presidonts veto of this trade bill as i said this is a bad trade bill its total impact on our trade policy will be disastrous to american workers and consumers instead of expanding trade to create more prosperity and more jobs this trade bill drags us in the direction of trade wars fewer jobs and a lower standard of living my colleagues are only kidding themselves if they think this bill is not protectionist investors in both unitedstates and foreign markets recognize the bill for what it is and the specter of rising protectionism has fueled the uncertainty in the markets and the downward pressure on the dollar by embedding a pattern of protectionism into our trade policy this bill will make it easier for a future administration to start a trade war or harder to resist one it is indicative of the tone of this whole bill that the focus has been on the plant closing provision but the real question is not how to arrange plant closings and layoffs america needs to pursue a plant opening policy to create even more jobs and a more competitive economy we need to encourage the creation of more jobs more employers especially in our doprcssed inner cities and rural areas we need incentives to create more venture capital to finance these entrepreneurs and small businesses we need a protrade trade policy be ginning with creation of a north american free trade area that would

of the united states appears to have been victimized more than other portions of the country there are incidents in such areas as maryland north carolina texas and florida among the types of medical wastes involved are unmarked needles and vials stained bandages catheter bags blood bags respirator parts and plastic tubing for intravenous drugs some of the vials have tested positive for the aids

swimming in the ocean as a result the tourist industry or our coastal states has suffered tremendously dumping of such wastes is also proliferating at land sites in april of this year some 2 000 vials

experts tell us that 25 percent of the 150 million pounds of waste produced annually by hospitals in this nation is considered infectious the fact is that socalled redbag wastewaste containing infectious materialis much more expensive to dispose of than ordinary waste material while hospitals might pay city sanitation departments 50 or 60 a ton for disposal of nonredbag waste private incineration companies charge up to 2 000 a ton for redbag waste disposal as in most human endeavors that cost substantial sums there seems to be no scarcity of persons willing to dump these wastes anywhere and everywhere in order to avoid the cost of proper disposal or to reap the profits of improper disposal procedures one of the problems in stopping the illegal and dangerous practice of

rules for the submission of the amendments was not a deadline that is the first question"], [0.00020259618759155273, 0.5002025961875916, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding yes that language has

of the aisle about the budget process particularly from individuals who are commenting about the inability of house democrats to reach a budget the gentlemen on the other side of the aisle that have commented know as well as i do that the republicans on the committee on the budget refuse to even submit a budget to be considered the members refuse to be a part of the process and when there were votes the members voted present the members did not note yes or no these members basically have withdrawn from the budget process these members have withdrawn from the need to resolve the deficit issue these members have withdrawn from the need to make sure that we get this government moving again and get this country moving again these members are not interested in that process but interested in political rhetoric in standing up and beating out the fact that we are trying to come to a conclusion in this process we are serious about it the members know it and we know it the members are just frustrated because they have an inability on their side of the aisle to reach an agreement on some type of budget resolution they have yet to present one we are intrigued we are intrigued with their cheap advice"]]}
