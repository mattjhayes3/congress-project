very good friend from colorado and my very good friend from florida this is a bipartisan amendment with respect to tunnels being used as a military tactic technology and strategy in asymmetric warfare almost exactly a year ago when war broke out in the middle east and hamas attacked israel i visited israel and saw for myself the sophistication of the tunnels being dug from gaza to israel through which terrorists traveled they went to the other side of the tunnels popped up and tried to kill innocent civilians these tunnels are not the tunnels that many of us characterize in our own minds these tunnels are sophisticated these are expressways underground it is like the queensmidtown tunnel going from gaza to israel they are ventilated they are lit they are massive they are deep they are huge they are impenetrable and they are very difficult to detect the fy16 intelligence authorization bill properly says that the director of national intelligence will designate an official to manage the collection and analysis of intelligence regarding the tactical use of tunnels by state and nonstate actors this bipartisan amendment simply asks for accountability it requires a report from this new lead intelligence officer for tunnels describing the trends in the use of tunnels by foreign state and nonstate actors and collaborative efforts between the united states and partner nations to address the use of tunnels by our adversaries i talked about tunnels in the middle east but in fact these tunnels are dynamic force multipliers for our enemies and enemies of our allies around the world they are used for terrorist attacks but they are also used to smuggle arms and contraband we have learned that these tunnels are being used well beyond israel korea is another example tunnels have been found in north korea here at home more than 150 tunnels have been found since 2009 we have plenty of enemies today looking for ways to attack the united states and our interests around the globe this bill recognizes these threats and very wisely creates a lead intelligence officer for tunnels this amendment simply encourages greater oversight by congress it allows congress to make informed decisions on how and where to spend future funds in order to counter this threat and protect unitedstates national security interests most importantly these reports will help shape the
