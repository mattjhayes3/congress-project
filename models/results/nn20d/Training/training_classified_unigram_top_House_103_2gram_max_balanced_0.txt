toledo spain the american society for the preservation of tradition family and property it is over at the mayflower hotel but they can walt for this moment and this special order that the gentleman has taken out tonight for a truly wonderful american who has been not only a great example to his own family i think but to all people in public service i say to the gentleman mr hyde im going to leave to you to discuss the career of your fellow navy world war ii veteran george bush and his outstanding naval career that began on his 18th birthday when his father drove him to a recruiting station and he signed up in the tradition of everybody in his family more than noblesse oblige but the burning desire to serve and to be part of history im going to leave to you what you said to me when i asked you whats the main thing that you think of when you think of george bush and you said to me character im going to leave that to you because thats certainly a fact i just want to announce a special order way ahead of time i am going to do an hour that i hope my colleagues will join me for on george bush on his 70th birthday next june 12 god willing that we are here but what i would like to talk about briefly tonight is friendship in the 12 years that we all got to know george bush the man and the public servant serving as ronald reagans vice president and then 4 years as the great leader of this nation i never once saw this distinguished american where he was not upbeat in a good mood and thinking about ways to help people i think you can learn an awful lot about a man or a woman by observing their children you can certainly observe a lot about barbara bush and the kind of wife and mother she has been by looking at their lovely smart daughter dorothy and those four stalwart sons who i think we are going to hear a lot from in the politics of this country but you can also learn a lot about a father and about a grandfather from the clan that he has built around him george bush is to me the very essence of the word friend and the word friendship i have never known in my life and probably never will know in my life anybody who can never let a moment go by if someone did him a kindness or said something to him that he thought was beneficial to this country where he would not sign handwrite a note this involved hours and hours out of every month of his life to thank people for their friendship to reward people with a personal little note if they were doing something good for their fellow man or for their country i think as the years go by in the next few coming years i want to say very positively here we will come as american citizens with each passing day to more and more and more appreciate not only what a fine man george bush is that is a given but what a great president he was i would only hope that a world war ii veteran like yourself henry will find time with your illinois primaries behind you to go to the normandy beaches on june 6 of next year for the 50th anniversary and that whoever else goes in delegations from the unitedstates government i would hope that george bush would find time to go there with a few friends because it was in 1944 as one of the youngest aviators in the navy that he first entered combat and began his 58 missions and very close brushes with death i just hope that you will ask for 5 additional days as there are a few little other things i can jot down over the next few days and insert into this special order also i hope that americans who did not get to know george bush personally will observe over the coming years because i think he is going to be around a long long time that they will observe the great dignity with which he will conduct himself and has already conducted himself as a former president and that as time goes by they will come to appreciate that it is awfully hard for someone who has spent his life in service and his life respecting the truth and who put together such an amazing coalition of nations 28 of them in desert storm to liberate a small country that had been run over by a thug saddam hussein that people will come to reevaluate a fine presidency that was shredded during the election campaign last year i think that history is not going to be as some of the newspaper folks say kind to george bush no it is not that soft history is going to be excellent to george bush and when they look at year after year of his presidency 1989 you think of that year you think of the berlin wall coming down 1990 you think of russian citizens voting for freedom going into a ballot box and voting for yelteln and by sheer coincidence that took place on his birthday june 12th it was christmas when the bloody hammer and sickle flag came down over the kremlin and that beautiful light blue white and red banner of russia the state of russia went up so many great things happened so fast that it was the very gentlemanness of the man of george bush that kept him from actually celebrating with his fellow citizens the collapse of what john f kennedy had called a long twilight struggle this evil of communism that killed more human beings than hitler ever could have murdered in his 12 years this nightmare ended and it was the decency of george bush to not celebrate but to do what he could to try and help further the process rather than cause any more consternation in the agony of a nation that had thrown off three quartersof a century of the yoke of tyranny so henry i am so pleased you have taken out this special order go for it try to let that 1 million audience that is out there with cameras panning this house stupidly as though no one is listening there are a million a million and a quarter people out there who want to heargood things about this great american i apologize for not being able to spend more time with you but i will contribute some things in writing tomorrow or the next day and you join me on his 70th birthday next june 12 i

to hire permanent replacements most managers chose not to permanently replace striking workers because of the very negative effect such action would have on labor relations within the company the knowledge that workera would eventually come back encouraged both sides of a labor dispute to keep the negotiations within some reasonable bounds of cordiality a tradition developed that kept labor disputes from becoming life or death struggles in the 1980s that all changed many companies began permanently replacing striking workers many more companies used the threat of permanent replacement in their negotiations with labor a tradition was ended and trust was broken labor unions have played a vital and constructive role in the growth of the american economy the american worker is the most productive in the world an achievement for which unions can claim some credit permanent replacement of striking workers destroys trust and could in fact destroy labor unions themselves the right to

amendment to the house bill 783 a bill which passed this house last november by voice vote under suspension of the rules this bill makes several important changes to the immigration laws section 101 of the bill modifies the immigration and nationality act to make it clear that any person born outside the united states to parents one of whom is a unitedstates citizen will be considered a unitedstates citizen under present law children born outside the united states before 1934 whose mother was a unitedstates citizen but whose father was not a unitedstates citizen are not deemed to be unitedstates citizens if the childs father had been the unitedstates citizen however then the child would be a unitedstates citizen this bill corrects this inequity in the law to provide for a uniformed determination of citizenship where at least one parent is a unitedstates citizen section 103 addresses another inequity in the immigration and nationality act from 1934 through 1978 unitedstates citizens who were born abroad to a unitedstates citizen parent and an alien parent were required to live in the united states for a specified period of time in order to retain their unitedstates citizenship this residency requirement was repealed in 1978 but herepeal was not retroactive as a result persons who had not lived in the united states for the requisite period of time lost their unitedstates citizenship h r 783 provides a means by which these persons may regain their unitedstates citizenship section 108 relates to the tests that persons seeking to become naturalized unitedstates citizens must pass in order to be naturalized under present law applicants for naturalization must pass both an english language test and a test relating to unitedstates government and history current law provides that waivers of the english language test may be granted to persons who suffer a disability preventing them from passing the test and to persons who are over the age of 50 and who have lived in the united states for 20 years or over the age of 55 and who have lived in the united states for 50 years section 108 of this bill would extend a similar waiver to the government and history test for any person who is over 65 years of age and who has lived in the united states for at least 20 years this waiver is to be determined on a case by case basis by the attorney general pursuant to regulations that she shall promulgate the bill also provides for the extension of several existing provisions of the immigration and nationality act currently set to terminate on september 30 1994 section 213 of the bill provides for the extension of time within which the president may undertake demonstration projects relating to the laws prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens specifically this section will extend for an additional 2 years the telephone employment verification system a demonstration project presently ongoing pursuant to which employers may verify by telephone the employment eligibility of potential employees the use of a telephonic verification system for potential employee eligibility to work has been the subject of much discussion of late congressman ken calvert has taken the lead on this issue and former congresswoman barbara jordan chair of the bipartisan unitedstates commission on immigration reform in her testimony before a subcommittee of the senate judiciary committee noted that one of the commissions eventual recommendations is likely to be the implementation of such a system i believe that such a system would be an efficient quick way for employers to verify the work eligibility of potential employees this system would dramatically decrease the opportunities for illegal aliens to obtain work in the united states one of the principle magnets that draws illegal aliens to this country h r 4577 a bill that i cosponsored with congressmen calvert would implement such a system on a nationwide basis section 214 provides for the extension of the religious worker category of special immigrant through 1997 section 215 provides for the extension for 2 more years the offcampus work authorization presently given foreign students who are studying in the united states section 209 extends for 2 more years the visa waiver pilot program under this program citizens of specified foreign countries are entitled to travel to the united states as tourists or business visitors for periods up to 90 days without having to obtain a visa prior to entering the country the countries which participate in this program are those which have had historically low rates of refusal for visa applications by the citizens the benefits of extending this program are several first participant countries must waive any visa requirement placed upon united states citizens who wish to travel to their country second by eliminating the requirement that citizens of participant countries apply for visas the overwhelming majority of which are granted this program significantly reduces the work load placed upon american embassy personnel abroad as a result fewer employees are needed in those embassies with the resultant cost savings benefiting american taxpayers finally the number of tourists from program participant countries visiting the united states generally increases once the country becomes part of the program as tourism is a major industry in this country eliminating unnecessary barriers to tourist travel is beneficial to our economy in addition to extending the present program section 210 of the bill creates a new category of probationary participating in the visa waiver program to enable countries to participate in the program which are not now eligible to do so countries eligible for this new probationary status of participant will be those which have made demonstrable improvements in their visa refusal rates and which would otherwise be eligible to participate in the program in the near future by expediting their inclusion in the program we cause the resultant benefits in increased tourism and cost saving at our embassies to occur sooner rather than later these provisions do not affect the screening process that goes on at our border which keeps out those who are convicted criminals terrorists etcetera finally i point out that this bill makes numerous technical corrections in the immigration laws i take this opportunity to note one in particular it is the intention of the drafters of the bill that section 218 be retroactive to the original effective date of the immigration act of 1990 the purpose of this provision is to make it clear that the priority date of any petition filed for classification under section 203 b of the immigration and nationality act which is accompanied by an individual labor certification from the department of labor shall be the date the application for certification was accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the department of labor this section is intended to remedy an inadvertent result created by the miscellaneous and technical immigration and naturalization amendments of 1991 as a result of how that act has been interpreted persons on whose behalf permanent residence petitions were not filed before october 1 1993 ran the risk of losing their priority date with respect to becoming legal permanent residents this has led to situations where persons who had waited for several years to become a permanent resident are placed at the bottom of the waiting list and are forced to wait many more years before becoming permanent residents the change under h r 783 will make it clear that priority date for this purpose is to be the date of any application for labor certification processed by the department of labor regardless as to whether a petition for permanent residence was filed on or before october 1 1993 the language in h r 783 has been worked out among various members of the subcommittee i would like to thank chairman mazzou and congressmen howard berman and barney frank for their work during the development of this bill last year i have been pleased to have continued that close relationship with chairman matzoli during the further modifications to the bill during this session of the 103d congress i believe the resulting product is a good
