1982 in a timely fashion as was intended by the congress because of the programs critical importance to our nations energy future we noted that the program had been modified to substantially reduce government involvement in the project and increase private sector involvement with full private sector funding beginning in 1984 the committee has reviewed this project at great length and with great care and i commend them for it we do not believe that funds already appropriated for fiscal year 1982 and reviewed so carefully should be deferred the secretary did not comply with the request in our

role in bringing this before us the house of representatives this week will consider two measures the hazardous materials transportation act amendments and the nuclear regulatory commission authorization which are of vital concern to citizens of illinois 20th congressional district at issue is the safe transportation of hazardous radioactive materials through quincy and the rural areas of illinois current nrc regulations require private shippers of nuclear wastes to hire armed escorts for high level radioactive shipments around cities of more than 100 000 citizens the effect of this requirement was not to increase the safety of these dangerous shipments but instead to cause shippers to send them over narrow twolane country roads which skirted large cities a prime example of this is the use of routes 36 and 24 in the western section of illinois for shipment of hazardous wastes from san onofre calif to the general electric storage facility at morris ill radioactive wastes have come across the mississippi river down quincys main street and then headed across country on a hilly narrow twolane road rough in many spots with nonexistent shoulders in many places during wet or icy weather this road is particularly dangerous even for normal traffic let alone nuclear shipments in my view all shipments of nuclear or hazardou wastes should be made over interstate highways statistics show that accidents are much more likely to occur on roads like routes 36 and 24 than on the major interstates with their dual lanes restricted access wide shoulders and singledirection traffic currently the department of transportation is considering regulations which will require all future shipments to be made only on interstate routes these regulations will go in effect february 1 1982 and i applaud the substance and intention of these new regulations before that time however the nrc regulations still remain in effect what this means for the state of illinois now that its ban on outofstate spent fuel shipments has been overturned in the courts is that these hazardous shipments may begin again over the same dangerous routes it is not difficult to imagine that a rush of shipments may occur before the february 1982 regulations take effect out of this concern i wrote the nrc in aprul of this year asking for assurance that they would not approve shipments of spent fuels over any noninterstate route either before or after the new regulations take effect as of yet i have received no response this troubles me greatly as i fear for the safety not only of the citizens of my district who live along routes 24 and 36 but for the safety of the spent fuel itself and for all citizens everywhere who may be affected by accidents involving such shipments clearly it is time for the nrc to recognize what the department of transportation has already acknowledged that shipment of spent fuel should be limited to the safe reliable interstate system and banned from hazardous dangerous secondary routes i am yet hopeful that i will have the assurances i have bcen seeking from nrc for the past 6 months and that i will not be forced to attempt a legislative solution to this
