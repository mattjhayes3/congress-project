or the values of our nation it is time for a new direction to meet our nations goals of economic security for our families and security for our homeland democrats have offered a plan democrats believe in paying down the debt and maintaining fiscal restraint and discipline democrats believe in real investment in lifelong education which enables every american to reach their potential and strengthens the longterm financial security of our families and our nation democrats believe in budgets that invest in our armed services to defend our homeland and to protect the men and women who defend us democrats believe in tax fairness and tax cuts for the middle class we believe in helping americans pay for college buy their first home find affordable health insurance and save for retirement we understand the priorities of everyday americans the republican budgets of the last 5 years have failed to meet each of these objectives at a time when american families are facing stagnant wages and everincreasing bills for child care for health care for college tuition and for gas at the pump the republican congress has failed to address these daytoday concerns instead they have enacted tax cuts for the very wealthy my constituents want congress to address their needs not the wants and desires of a select few it is clear which side the majority has chosen instead of budgeting fairly the republicans have relied on smokeandmirror borrowandspend gimmicks they dont include the war in iraq and the military activities in afghanistan in their budget they dont include the massive costs of repealing the estate tax for estates valued at 10 million or more and they dont include the full cost of the medicare part d prescription drug benefit despite these efforts to keep costs hidden their budget schemes create new deficits every year and have added nearly 3 5 trillion to our national debt american families deserve better and they deserve a new direction instead of making smart investments in americas future the republican budgets have run up massive deficits each year and have added to our national debt so that as of now our national debt is nearly 8 5 trillion this means that we spend more on interest payments on our debt than the combined federal investments in education homeland security and veterans health care combined the nations debt is unsustainable and it is immoral american families deserve better they deserve a new direction the budget policies of the bush administration and this republican congress leave our nation less secure their schemes rely on borrowing more and more money from foreign investors more money mind you than the amount borrowed by all past american presidents combined and instead of enhancing our safety at home and bolstering our security abroad the republican congress continues to underfund important security initiatives at our ports chemical plants and along our borders this at the same time they are failing to enact many of the 9 11 commissions recommendations including enabling our police and firefighters to communicate seamlessly american families expect the government to make the necessary investments to keep them safe and they believe that the american dream should be available to everyone not a select few they deserve a new direction democrats understand that unless we change ourse the harmful effects of the republicans borrowandspend budget policies will only continue democrats have a plan that makes tough fiscally disciplined choices to restore our budget to balance and to meet our obligations to american families democrats have a plan that fulfills the basic budgetary principles of living within our means and democrats have a plan to reduce wasteful spending and make smart investments in all americans that will ensure the nations current and future fiscal wellbeing and protect the safety security and freedoms that make our nation great americans work hard every day my constituents work hard every day to meet their obligations to their families to their communities and to their nation we must honor their commitment and we should not and cannot walk away from our obligations to them the democrats are committed to fiscal responsibility the democrats are committed to the future of our nation and the democrats are prepared to lead the nation in a new direction"],

andbalanced budget that represents all people in this country so i am pleased to take this time in this special order this evfting to talk about the cruel and shameful budget and the tax cuts the republican majority wants to ram through this house on wednesday or thursday of this week after hearing my republican colleagues in the first hour special order tonight i would hope that they are paying a great deal of attention to what is going on with this reconciliation budget otherwise there is not going to be any money for all of those good ideas they have for health care it was a pleasure to hear their good ideas now that we are going to talk about where the money will be and where the money is going in our budget and it is something we are going to be dealing with straight up wednesday or thursday of this week it is also time for the people of this country to know what is going on it is time to stop this railroad and help the american people learn just what the republicans are up to they keep acting as robin hood in reverse it comes out in the various committees and in bringing up this vote this week on the house floor a vote that will hurt hardworking americans because of a package of bills in the billions of dollars at least 50 billion that will include hurtful budget cuts but makeno mistake about it these budget priorities are outrageous they meaning the republicans want to provide 70 billion to 100 billion in new tax cuts for the powerful and the privileged in america who need them the least while cutting programs for the rest of the country and they are going to pay for these irresponsible tax cuts for the most well off by shredding the safety net for the most vulnerable in our society those who live under or near the poverty line and by breaking the social contract with hardworking middleclass americans as well and oh yes what the republicans do not wring out of the blood sweat and tears of working and impoverished americans through budget cuts will just be added to the debt of the next generation of americans can you believe it this is the first budget reconciliation package in the history of our country that actually increases federal deficits at least another 25 billion which will be added to the deficit this year without batting an eye while pretending to be the guardians of our treasury republicans in charge of this congress just keep borrowing and spending piling up debt that our grandchildren and their children will owe ten years ago the republicans took control of this house trumpeting their contract with america with great fanfare if you will all remember it but now one decade later it is plain for all of us to see that their slick marketing gambit has proven to be a contract on america particularly those struggling to face financial ends the numbers and the budget tradeoffs recommended in this budget package speak for themselves but let me cite a few examples for my colleagues to pay for a 70 billion to 100 billion tax cut and these are new tax cuts by the way the republicans in control of this house want to slash 844 million from the food stamp program which would result in 300 000 families being kicked off of this antihunger program it would leave 40 000 children ineligible for school lunches apparently the republicans do not realize the number of malnourished children and americans grew by more than 2 million in the past year the republicans want to cut 14 5 billion from student aid programs at precisely the time when paying for college education has become more difficult than in any generation in the past these shortsighted education cuts including the largest cut in the history of the student loan program are certain to increase the interest rates and the fees that many students will have to pay the republicans are going after single mothers they are cutting 500 million in federal support for child care assistance leaving an additional 250 000 children without quality child care adding insult to injury the republicans are cutting almost 5 billion from child support enforcement programs that help to collect money from deadbeat dads so much for compassionate conservatism when it comes time to give tax cuts to rich cronies of the republican majority the republicans are cutting 9 5 billion from medicaid the federal program that extends basic health care to the poorest and neediest of americans home heating bills are expected to be 30 to 50 percent higher this coming winter but that is not keeping the republicans in control of this house from voting against full funding of the low income home energy assistance program liheap and evidence is strong and persuasive that many of these programs while not perfect we know that have made progress towards goals shared by americans across the political spectrum such as preventing hunger destitution and homelessness protecting childrens health and rewarding lowpaid work when our constituents experience crises in their personal lives such as job loss or disabilities these programs can cushion them against deep poverty when people have low earnings or little or no health insurance these programs can supplement their incomes and provide essential health care coverage and when people reach retirement age these programs provide some measure of retirement and health security research and data from the center on budget and policy priorities and other experts around the country show that the united states system of income support benefits have helped make tens of millions of americans healthier and more secure without properly funded programs like food stamps medicaid state childrens health insurance programs unemployment insurance and the supplemental security program for the elderly and disabled poor ours will be a harsher and less compassionate society with more extreme hardship especially among children and people who are elderly and people who do have disabilities the happy warrior senator hubert humphrey used to remind us that the character of a society can best be judged by how it cares for those in the dawn and the twilight of life by this measure the republicans who are in charge of all branches of our government today and who are responsible for these budget and tax cuts are failing the american people woefully they are particularly failing our children and students and their education as i said earlier the republican reconciliation budget will pay for between 70 and 100 billion in new tax cuts for the rich by cutting very critical social programs this budget would break the backs of hardworking poor and middleclass families in order to break the bank to pay for tax cuts for wealthy families let us talk about how this budget actually affects family values let us talk about how we could use that 70 billion to 100 billion to keep some important promises to the average american family for instance the head start program offers lowincome families the promise that their young children will not start school at a disadvantage but we serve fewer than half of the eligible 3 and 4year olds nationwide yet instead of providing the 5 billion increase that it would take to ensure this opportunity for every eligible child this year president bush and the republican congress are cutting 70 to 100 billion in taxes at the very top level almost 4 years ago president bush and the republican congress passed the no child left behind act and joined in a bipartisan promise to american families that we would provide schools with resources they need to educate all of our children they said that they would use no child left behind to diagnose where dollars were needed to turn poorer performing schools and school districts around so that actually no child would be left behind since then the president and the republican congress have fallen more than 40 billion short of keeping that promise and so no child left behind has become punitive instead of helpful we could do better by our children if we spent that 40 billion on those children and did not cut taxes for the wealthiest people in this country in 1975 the federal government promised families that it would fully fund its share of idea the individuals with disabilities education act but 30 years later we are less than halfway there last year president bush and the republican congress made another bipartisan promise to increase funding for idea by 4 billion this year and to fully fund idea by the year 2011 it sounded good a lot of us voted for it and a lot of us did not but within a few months of signing the new law the president broke his promise by more than 3 5 billion no billion dollars so we could use 3 5 billion of the tax cuts for the wealthy to keep this bipartisan promise to fund idea as was promised or even better we could use 13 2 billion to fully fund idea up to the federal responsibility another federal student aid for college offers lowand middleincome families the promise of an education to prepare them for jobs in the 21st century 14 3 billion would enable us to offset the cuts that the republican reconciliation budget would make to federal student aid programs the largest cuts by the way in history these cuts would add 5 800 to the cost of the typical students college loans while students whose families can pay outright for the best colleges and do not need loans get another tax cut another 4 2 billion would enable us to keep another promise that president bush has not come close to keeping that would be to increase the annual pell grant for lowincome students to 5 100 or we could reduce the tax cuts for the wealthy by 7 billion to keep the bipartisan promise made in 1998 to increase the pell grant to 5 800 but at a time when the buying power of pell grants is only about half of what it was at its peak the president and the republican congress have virtually frozen pell grants since the year my colleagues how we choose to allocate federal resources is a reflection of our values our values as members of congress our values as leaders of our country and the choices we will make this year will be one of the most critical choices any of us will make during our time in congress we can pass the republican reconciliation budget which i believe makes a mockery of the term family values unless of course the only families you value are the nations wealthiest families or we can pass a budget that truly helps all of americas families i hope that we will make the right choice i hope that we will invest in our families and their children which by the way is an investment in our nations ability to compete in the international marketplace"], [0.13229793310165405, 0.867702066898346, 1, "it is an honor being before the house once again as you know the 30something working group we come to the floor as often as possible to not only share with the members what is going on as it relates to legislatioii here in washington d c but also what is not going on on behalf of the american people and hopefully we can put forth ideas and extending the arm to work in a bipartisan way on behalf of the american people so we are glad to come to the floor week after week also i would like to thank the democratic leader for allowing us to have this hour and also our democratic whip mr steny hoyer and mr james clyburn who is our chairman of our democratic caucus and mr larson who is our vicechair i think it is important that we come to the floor to share a unified message from this side that we are willing and able we have the will and the desire to work on behalf of the american people in general not just democrats not just republicans or independents but the american people in general to make sure the people of good will prevail in their everyday lives if they are a veteran if they are an individual that has fallen on hard times if they run a small business in this country if they have a midsized business that they want to turn into a big business we want to be able to be of some assistance as it relates to legislating here on behalf of the american people also i think it is iriiportant that we do not leave our children behind even though they cannot vote many of them are under the age of 18 years old not eligible to vote i think it is important that we stand for them there are a number of things that i am going to try to touch on today to make sure that we can cover all of just about all of what is happening and what is not happening here in washington d c i took the time when we were on break last week to really look closely at some of the comparisons because when you are trying to figure out what is happening to the issues that we all came to washington to work so hard on you have to compare it is almost like you have to have a sidebyside what we call it here in washington d c to compare it is almost like for someone who goes to the grocery store to buy an orange i am from florida nine times out of ten you are going to pick up those two oranges if they are from two different orange groves and kind of compare to see if it is an orange you are not going to grab an apple and grab an orange and start saying well which one looks like an orange but i must say here in washington d c it is almost like an orange and an apple experience because we are so far apart as it relates to working together on many of these issues that are facing our constituents back home and the american men and women that are overseas fighting on our behalf i looked at the issue of fiscal responsibility and i could not help but notice within the house gop budget that the budget calls for deficits as far as the eye can see never achieving a balance and adding another 2 3 trillion to the national debt over 5 years compared to the democratic alternative and the democratic philosophy if we can work in a bipartisan way to be able to balance this budget balance the budget over the next 5 years making sure that we can balance it over the next 6 years on a payasyougo philosophy e 1630 i will talk a little bit about that as i continue to go down this chart we believe that we can balance this budget because we have done it before unlike the republican conference or the republican side of the house which has not there was a surplus when the republicans took control of this house or when the president went into office and president bush went into office now we are into record deficits and i think it is important that we point this out and i have charts to be able to break that down for the members i think it is also important to think about making america safer here at home i looked at the republican budget and i could not help but notice that it made homeland security guts by 488 million this year and it is up to 6 1 billion over the next 5 years of cuts to homeland security and it is not much better than the presidents budget that came out of this house it estimated that port security grants and rail transit security grants will all be rolled into a smaller program and i think that that is something that is going to hurt a lot of local communities on the democratic side in our budget and our motion to recommit of our philosophy as it relates to what we should be doing by the homeland is to provide 6 5 billion more over the next 5 years for homeland security here by guaranteeing funding for border security port security and first responders which are so important to so many counties and local governments that are out there on the frontline that have to respond to the american people in their time of need adequate funding for veterans this is another point i will elaborate a little bit more during this hour of the facts like we always say during the 30something working group this is not what we came up with these are the facts and they are backed up by the congressional record or either a very credible thirdparty validator we start looking at that and we look at the republican budget that passed off this floor it cuts funding to veterans health care by 6 billion over the next 5 years the democratic alternative budget provides 8 6 billion more over the next 5 years for veterans health care then there is the gop budget it also rejects an increase in tricare which is a health care program for veterans for more than 3 million military retirees and their families these are increased costs that the republican budget has put on them and i am going to talk about that a little further it targets as it relates to tax cuts for the middle class the republican budget follows the presidents budget that goes back to the rubberstamp congress the rubberstamp republican congress that i talked so much about and it also happens to be a reality when you look at this issue you have to look at it from the standpoint of the presidents budget which provides 2 5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years targeted for the very wealthiest americans the wealthiest taxpayers versus the democratic alternative that provides 105 billion for the middle class tax relief such as child tax credit marriage penalty relief and the 10 percent individual bracket i think it is also important for me to point out here as it relates to the issue of college making college more affordable and i had to look at this part of the budget and this is another area that i am going to talk a little bit more about because we have so many people and some middleaged people in america we do know that we have some americans that do not go from high school straight into college because they have to nine times out of ten get a job to be able to build up the money to go to college to be able to maybe take care of a family member that is up in age and they need that kind of assistance or they cannot go off to college or they have to go to a community college before they can go to a 4year institution everyone does not have a turnkey life so we have to look at policy that is going to be able to help all americans not just some when we look at the republican majority budget what it had in it this is straight from the budget this is not anything that i have put together to have some sort of lean towards making our proposals look better than the republican majority these are just the facts here in the house when you look at it it is identical once again and i think it is important the reason why i have this rubber stamp back here that i will proudly bring out in just a few moments is the fact that the president hands down what he would like to the policies that he would like to have here in this congress he would like for us to rubberstamp and the republican majority honors him in rubberstamping exactly the way it was written i think it is important in america in the peoples house the only housethat you have to be elected to that you cannot be appointed to over in the senate you can be appointed by a governor that the people should have an opportunity to be heard once again not just democrats not just republicans not just independents not just folks who vote but the american people should be represented and for them to be represented appropriately i think it is important that we have the kind of conversation and dialogue here that is going to benefit all americans and in this case it is identical to the presidents budget it freezes pell grants for colleges and denies more than 460 000 students lowcost loans this also is on the top of 12 billion cuts in the student loan funding that republicafis just enacted it is already there so what we are trying to do is i believe to turn that around and i am going to talk about legislation that we have to turn that around but as it relates to our alternative budget it rejects the gop cuts and higher education programs it also lowers the costs of student loans by cutting the interest rate per student loan in the fall of 2007 i think that is important there are a lot of folks that are sending their kids off to college right now there are a lot of folks that are writing letters for just 1 000 scholarships for local organizations because the costs of college have gone up when we mkke these cuts here in washington dc the state government has to make their cuts to the students and to the families that live down in those states and i think it is important that we look at this and i will talk about that a little further explaining educational opportunities i think it is important when you look at this part of the budget identical to the bush budget well that seems to be a common theme here which underfunds no child left behind by 39 percent denies extra math and reading help to 3 7 million children and shutting 2 million children out of afterschool programs on the democratic side our alternative provides 4 6 billion more dollars in 2007 and 35 3 billion over the next 5 years for education and training programs more than the gop budget i think this is important for families and parents like myself who know what it means that when your kids go to school you have to pay for aftercare and nine times out of ten that aftercare is like 150 to sometimes 200 a week some of you parents know what i am talking about unfortunately members of the republican side of this house do not understand what you are talking about and opt to invest 87 000 in tax cuts to millionaires so i think it is important that we look at this as it relates to a comparison one other thing that i think is important and justified here in this case that we roll right into what this means as it relates to the dollars and cents before we get into some of the policy issues that are called out here we can get right down to the nittygritty by saying over the last 5 years president bush and also the republican majority here came in and had a projected surplus in the next 10 years when the president took office of 5 6 trillion 5 6 trillion and that has now turned into a 3 3 trillion deficit now it would be kind of hard to say well the democrats took us down that line and they made us do this and they made us do that i can tell you that is not true that is not true we have tried to substitute a number of policies that would save this country in the future and would save our future for our children so they are not paying exorbitant tax and fees that this republican congress has put on them and have put on the american people it affects everything it affects social security it affects education it affects our way of being able to come up with alternative fuels it affects the way our troops are treated when they come back it affects our veterans it affects everyday families the decisions that are made here on this floor as it relates to the budget and as it relates to the spending affects everyone all americans it affects everyone that depends on this government to govern not to follow not to rubberstamp but to govern and i think that is very very important when you look at the tax bill that obviously the president wanted and the republican majority rubberstamped i think it is important that you look at the fact that we have now mortgaged our childrens future the republicans have passed this tax cut which has sunken us deeper 80 billion deeper into debt over the next 10 years and will benefit the few the wealthy i think it is also important for us to understand that we have to have fiscal discipline lets just talk a little bit about that because i want to make sure that everyone understands what we are talking about here well here is a chart again it is so selfexplanatory we just continue to use it and use it and use it the unfortunate part is that the numbers will change soon it will not change in the way of saying we are doing better no it will change in that we are doing worse when i say we i am saying led by the republican majority here in the house two hundred twentyfour years 1 01 trillion borrowed from foreign nations since the president has been president president bush and the republican majority has been in control over the last 4 years 2001 to 2005 president bush and the republican congress that is under his picture have borrowed 1 05 trillion i do not care there is no way you can explain how this is good no member need it be republican the one independent or democrat on this floor can explain how this can be good for the american people now time after time i have asked for an explanation from republicans during their time when they are on the floor to explain this all i hear is cricket sounds i look down the hall no one is there i am wondering where the fiscal conservatives in this house are as it relates to the republican majority i wonder where the leadership is as it relates to being able to turn this around there has been no attempt and i mean no documented attempt to be able to turn this around this is unprecedented the first time in the history of the country now this is not the first time in this century or the first time in the last 20 years or the first time in the last 200 years this is the first time in the history of the republic that any congress and any president has borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign nations the first time the first time i mean it is not like well this happened a couple years ago no the first time in the history of this country should you be alarmed you doggone right you should be alarmed fortytwo presidents could not do it 224 years of a country with all of itg challenges could not do it but when you get president bush in the white house and you get a rubberstamp republican majority here in the house of representatives they can do it unfortunately if we continue with the same team that we have leading in this house and in the white house this is going to continue to grow and it is going to be very very unfortunate because countries are going to start to disrespect this country because we do not have not we the republican majority here in this house does not have the ability to govern and to govern in a way that it should following thepresident unfortunately on this issue where we could show clearly that this is not a winner did this chart come from the democratic caucus i think not these numbers came from the unitedstates department of the treasury so you can get on whatever web site you want to get on and you can find this you dan definitely find it on www housedemocrats gov 30something all of these charts will be there i suggest you download the chart and print it and show it to yout friends because they need to know 1645 what does it mean when i say folks start to disrespect this country we get members coming in this chamber and people giving speeches throughout the country burning all kinds of federal jet fuel talking about terror talking about what you should be scared of i can telliyou right now we need to be dealing with terror and we need to be dealing with it in a smart way and protect the homeland and that is not happening right now take it from me i am the ranking member on the homeland security subcommittee on oversight and i can tell you it is not happening right now we have not issued one subpoena to be able to rein in individuals that are stealing from this government contractors and individuals within the department that is allowing it to happen that is another special order that i will not get into right now but if you want to talk about disrespecting the united states of america this is not something that is foreign born or someone that released an audiotape or a videotape here this is what happened right here on the floor the borrowing that i talked about over the last 4 years how did it happen japan 882 8 billion bought our debt japan did not say hey we want yall to overspend we want you to give tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires we want you to do things that you cannot afford to do just because you can japan did not say well just because the president said we should do it that you should rubber stamp it no that is what the republican congress did and we do need a change and we need alternatives we have talked about those alternatives china 249 8 billion they bought our debt china red china communist china the u k want to talk about our ally and friend yeah they are our friends all right they bought 223 2 billion of our debt we did have the prime minister here he addressed a joint session i did not hear him and i was reading his speech as he was up here giving his speech he did not say hey keep spending in an irresponsible way so we can buy your debt and own a piece of the american apple pie he did not say that but the republican congress continues to rubber stamp presidents bushs policies to say that we are being fiscally responsible meanwhile there is 1 05 trillion that we borrowed from foreign nations caribbean countries 115 3 billion bought our debt taiwan 71 3 billion little taiwan they are even in the game of getting part of this american apple pie with the republican congress giving it away they are willing to buy it up guess who we owe we owe every last one of these countries that i have ripped off this chart so far canada just north of us 53 8 billion korea 66 5 billion germany 65 7 billion opec nations well you know opec nations who are they oil producing countries whether it be saudi arabia iran iraq you name it these countries are in this opec nation and they are even in the game of buying a piece of the american apple pie at 67 8 billion well i have this kind of flag here that is kind of draped over the united states of america and i said we want to get back there i would urge the members to do one of twothings one work in a bipartisan way and pick up payasyougo policies as we have talked about and have put on this floor here in this house time after time again and saying that if you are going to give 1 billion to a contractor to do whatever he wants to do with it without any little oversight then doggone it you better figure out how you are going to pay for it if you are going to give tax cuts to folks who are not asking for them you better show how you are going to pay for it not just saying we will borrow from these foreign nations we continue to borrow because we can borrow and make history in 4 years that was not accomplished in over 224 years no we are going to make history the republican majority is going to make history in 4 years at 1 05 trillion that is a lot of money with a big t 224 years 1 01 trillion fortytwo presidents could not even muster up that if you want to get back to a balanced budget that i talked about earlier that i am going to continue to pound on then have a democratic majority or work in a bipartisan way one of the two i have more faith in the fact of the democratic majority getting the job done than the republicans allowing us to work in a bipartisan way towards having a balanced budget you want to talk about partisanship partisanship over the budget is at the highest level that it could be because you have one side with the will and the desire to balance the budget and you have the other side republican majority that says they want to balance the budget but do not have the will and the desire to do it that is the sidebyside on that you have to have the will and the desire to do it i cannot go to my daughter and say lauren i want you to go out and play softball well she may not have the will and the desire to play softball but just because i have the will and desire does not necessarily mean that she has to have it well guess what on this side of the ball we have the will and the desire to balance the budget not only do we have the will and the desire history is on our side history is on our side because we balanced the budget we actually did it the democratic house did it without one republican vote not one maybe i could say maybe two three fournot one republican vote we balanced the budget and put this country in surplus we could have dealt with social security could have took it beyond the time it is supposed to have issues could have made sure that veterans did not have to pay copayments could have made sure that we could have been ahead as it relates not to below the 39 percent in funding leave no child behind could have provided more tax cuts for the middle class it is what it is and i would tell you if folks want to get back to a balanced budget and not have these countries in all due respect in our pocketthese countries have their hand in our pocket not because of the folks that are running around here trying to make a living every day it is because of the republican majority what they have done opec nations got their hands straight in our pocket germany has their hand in our pocket at 6 7 billion the unitedstates taxpayers pocket korea 66 5 billion they have their hands in our pocket taiwan 71 3 billion have their hands in our pocket canada 53 8 billion have their hands in the american taxpayers pocket caribbean countries 115 3 billion have their hands in the american taxpayers pocket the u k 223 2 billion have their hands in the american taxpayers pocket and china have a handandahalf in the american taxpayers pocket and reaching for their credit card while they are at it at 249 8 billion japan has just outright snatched the wallet out of the back of the taxpayers pocket and grabbed someones pocketbook and have their hand in the pocket of the unitedstates taxpayers at 682 8 billion not because the american people went out there and said let us make sure that we spend money that we do not have and let us make records in 4 years in borrowing money from foreign nations the republican majority they have rubber 9tamped the bush administration policy and here we are so what do we do what we do is we make changes and what we have tried to do on this side is do exactly that it would be hard for me as a member of the

thank the distinguished gentleman from south carolina for yielding me this time and i thank him for his great leadership in putting together a budget that is a statement of our values that is balanced in terms of our priorities and balanced fiscally he has always conducted the process of creating a budget in a way that has ififormed members has done so with great dignity and great fairness and great respect for all points of view i wish we would all join in acknowledging the great leadership of the gentleman from south carolina our ranking member on the committee on the budget in 1994 the first item in the republicans contract with america was the fiscal responsibility act republicans pledged to restore fiscal responsibility to an outofcontrol congress requiring them to live under the same budget constraints as families and businesses more than 10 years later an outoftouch republican majority has taken fiscal responsibility to a new low it is clear that in the 10 years the republicans have become addicted to deficits the budget deficit for this year is a record 427 billion the february budget deficit my colleagues of 114 billion for the month of february a deficit of 114 billion is the highest monthly deficit ever and the first time it ever went over 100 billion in one month in 2001 president clinton left president bush with a projected 5 6 trillion in surplus in just 4 years president bush has turned that record surplus into a record deficit of nearly 4 trillion a 10 trillion swing in the wrong direction make no mistake these deficits are the direct result of republican policies huge tax cuts for the wealthy a refusal to pay as you go poor planning for a war of choice in iraq the list goes on and on and on america is awash in red ink because of republican budget irresponsibility tragically this republican budget is yet another missed opportunity to return to fiscal discipline not only is this budget fiscally irresponsible the republican budget is dishonest it does not cut the deficit in half as republicans claim in fact it makes the deficit worse republicans leave out the realistic cost of the war the cost of expiring tax provisions the true cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax and the cost of any changes to social security the budget is dishonest in another way it fails to show any def7 icit figures at all after 2010 in our new partnership for americas future democrats have made a commitment to honor the value of accountability including eliminating deficit spending and holding those in power accountable for their actions with a high 6thical standard democrats support honest accountable budgets that pay as you go the democratic alternative offered by the gentleman from south carolina achieves balance by 2012 the republican budget never reaches balance it heaps tons of debt onto our children and grandchildren and it will eventually lower our standard of living we cannot let that happen to our country and on top of all of that the republican budget undermines the solvency of social security while republicans ignore the real crisis of ballooning budget deficits the president falsely claims there is a crisis in social security but just because the president says it does not make it so he is simply wrong according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office social securitys trust fund will grow every year until a high of 8 3 trillion in 2032 and continues to be solvent until 2052 i want to call your attention to this chart my colleagues the left bar represents the deficit in the general fund between now and 2035 a staggering 15 trillion the bush administration has taken us onto atrajectory of reckless budgeting that will take us to 15 trillion in deficit in 2035 from 2006 to 2035 15 trillion in deficit this bar here the second bar social security 2006 to 2080 twice as long more than twice as long the social security deficit is 2 trillion it is clear that there would be plenty of money to deal with the social security trust fund if the president were not using the social security trust fund as a slush fund to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america instead of doing that we have a moral and legal obligation to pay back to the trust fund the money the president has taken out we cannot let the president do this by running enormous deficits the republicans want to force the government to break its promises to the elderly how on earth are they going to pay the social security trust fund back if they have gone broke on the other side by running up these deficits in the general fund democrats will keep americas promises to our seniors democrats have done it before and we will do it again when bill clinton was president we had 3 years of surpluses and with the surpluses imagine think of it zero deficits 427 billion in deficit for this year over 100 billion in deficit for the month of february alone this year and when president clinton was president the 3 years at the end of his term we had zero deficits and with the surpluses that were produced he was able to pay nearly 400 billion off of our indebtedness strengthening the solvency of social security likewise the democratic alternative that wag offered today included payasyougo rules that would block new tax or spending legislation that is not paid for not only is the republican budget fiscally reckless and dishonest it is morally irresponsible the leaders of five protestant denominations the episcopal church usa the evangelical lutheran church in america the presbyterian church usa the united church of christ and the united methodist church recently called president bushs budget unjust they reminded us of the words of the prophet micah who said what does the lord require of you but

making more than 500 000 a year while underfunding head start no child left behind student loans and grants and other education initiatives by 2 5 billion is that doing justice to our children is it doing justice to our communities to give tax cuts to the wealthy while funding for community police and local fire fighters who are vital to our homeland security by cutting them by 280 million is that justice is it doing justice to those who serve in uniform to give those tax cuts while underfunding health care benefits for veterans by 14 billion short of what is needed over the next 5 years is that justice for our veterans and is it doing justice to give tax cuts to the wealthy while launching a shameful attack on the poor this budget cuts 20 billiofi from medicaid a cut that governors on a bipartisan basis oppose and which the other body today has just rejected let us hear it for the other body it undermines the community development block grant initiative with all considered

deficits year after year during the 1990s democrats and republicans worked together with the clinton administration to cut the red ink and balance the budget for the first time in many years we balanced the budget in 1998 wekept it balanced in 1999 2000 and 2001 indeed we ran budget surpluses during those years and for the first time in a generation actually began to pay down the national

deficits are they do not tell the whole story since these figures do not include the money the federal government borrows from social security and medicare trust funds each year in 2005 alone the federal government borrowed nearly 175 billion from the trust funds and were on course to borrow even more this year we cannot continue on the course were on it is wrong for this congress and this president tokeep borrowing half a trillion dollars each and every year and then pass this debt along to our children it is wrong for congress and the president to keep borrowing more and more from foreigners to fund tax cuts for the very wealthy china alone owns more than 818 billion of our debt the majoritys budget simply digs the deficit hole deeper the republican budget proposes a 348 billion deficit for 2007 if you add in the borrowing from social security and medicaremoney that by law must be repaidthe total deficit for 2007 soars to 543 billion the hard truth is that under the majoritys budget the federal budget never comes into balance the tide of red ink rises forever this policy is unsustainable and morally indefensible tucked away in this budget is a provision to raise the governments borrowing limit another 653 billion this would be on top of the 3 trillion in debt limit increases already approved since president bush took office at the very least there should be a straight upordown vote on a debt limit of this magnitude but evidently the plan is to try to sneak this through the majoritys budget also contains irresponsible cuts in critical domestic programs in this regard the majority has mirrored the bush administrations budget which included deep cuts in education critical medical research environmental protection veterans health care to name only a few areas there has been an attempt tonight to place a fig leaf over some of these cuts with a vague half promise of perhaps adding an additional 7 1 billion for domestic programs later all this fig leaf

representative spratr the spratt budget pays down the deficits over the next 5 years and achieves balance in 2012 we restore fiscal discipline by bringing back the payasyougo budgeting rules and we force a degree of accountability by requiring the house to take a separate upordown vote on measures to increase the national debt limit in addition the democratic budget alternative provides 150 billion for future tax cuts and requires that any further tax cuts meet the payasyougo rules lastly our budget alternative rejects yet another round of spending cuts to key domestic programs that have been cut repeatedly in recent years the choice before the house could not be more clear we can vote to continue the failed economic policies of the last 5 yearspolicies that have resulted in massive

strong fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition i rise this afternoon to discuss our nations debt as you can see here today the united states national debt is 8 413 298 480 959 and some change if you divide that enormous number by every man woman and child including those babies being born today every united states citizens share of the national debt comes to the tune of 28 120 in the blue dog coalition we have coined the phrase the debt tax not to be confused with the death tax or estate tax the debt tax debt is one tax that cannot go away until we get our nations fiscal house in order that is what the democratic fiscally conservative 37memberstrong blue dog coalition is all about trying to restore some commonsense and fiscal discipline to our nations government as you walk the halls of congress and as you walk the halls of the cannon and the longworth and the rayburn house office buildings you will come across these posters which signify that you have walked by the door of an office of one of our fellow blue dog members we are concerned about this because from 1998 through 2001 this nation had a balanced budget and yet under this administration and this republicanled congress we have seen record budget deficits the largest deficits ever ever in our nations history in 2004 the deficit was 412 billion in 2005 it was 318 billion in 2006 it was 372 billion and in fiscal year 2007 it is projected to be 350 billion one of the largest deficits ever in our nations history one of the first bills i filed as a member of congress when i got here back in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund the republican leadership in this congress refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why because the real deficit projected for fiscal year 2007 is not 280 billion or 350 billion depending on whose numbers you want to believe it is really 545 billion so where does the difference come about it is because this republican congress and this administration is counting the social security trust fund and that is wrong when you and i go to the bank to get a loan our banker wants to know how we are going to pay it back when are we going to pay it back and yet this republican congress continues to give us the largest budget deficits ever in our nations history while borrowing money from the social security trust fund with no provision being made on how or when that money will be paid back where is it going come from they cannot tell us when is it going to be paid back they cannot tell us social security has kept over half the seniors in america out of poverty it is time for this republican congress to keep their hands off the social security trust fund now why is this debt so important total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was 5 67 trillion let me repeat that from 1789 until 2000 the total national debt was 5 67 trillion but by 2010 the total national debt will have increased to 10 88 trillion this is a doubling this is a doubling of the 211year debt in just 10 years another reason that deficits should matter is because interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the federal budget and the debt tax debt tax is one that cannot be repealed until we get back to the days of a balanced budget not only is our nation borrowing 1 billion a day this number is going up by about 1 billion a day our nation is borrowing 1 billion a day more important than that our nation is spending a half a billion dollars 500 million every single day simply paying interest on the national debt that we already got before it goes up another billion dollars a day i represent a very poor district in arkansas we have a lot of hope in creating economic opportunities by building new highways we need 1 6 billion to complete interstate 69 it sounds like a staggering number until you think about it if we did not have this debt we could build interstate 69 with 3 days interest on the national debt our government will spend more money in the next 4 days paying interest not principal just interest on the national debt than what it would cost to completely build interstate 69 through arkansas interstate 49 will also be critical to creating economic opportunities and jobs for my district we need 1 5 billion to finish it again a staggering number until you think about we are spending 500 million dvery 24 hours simply paying interest on the debt we already got before it goes up another billion dollars today we could complete interstate 49 with just 3 days interest on the national debt hot springs arkansas we need about 200 million to complete the expressway around hot springs 80 million to get it up the hill and up the mountain and another 100 to 200 million to get it back down and totally completed 80 million would be nice 200 million would be better we could complete the hot springs expressway with just a few hours interest on the national debt el dorado arkansas the largest town in my district not located on a fourlane highway desperately needs fourlane access we could fourlane unitedstates highway 167 for about 400 million put it another way we could fourlane unitedstates highway 167 from little rock to el dorado and connect on down to louisiana to 120 with less than 1 days interest on the national debt interstate 1530 200 million to complete that project that is also under construction a lot of money but just a few hours interest on the national debt in fact we could build 200 brandnew elementary schools every single day in america just with the interest we are spending on the national debt we cannot meet americas priorities as it relates to reducing our dependence on foreign oil in fact we will spend we will spend more money in iraq in the next 8 hours than we will spend on research and development of biorefineries in the next 365 days health care education making the kind of advancements to our nations infrastructure that we so desperately need the kind of investments that we saw under roosevelt with the wpa program to help get us out of the great depression or with eisenhower with the interstate program these kinds of priorities for america will continue to go unmet until we get our nations fiscal house in order that is why as a member of the blue dog cqalition i am here to talk about this debt and this deficit because america has many priorities many priorities that continue to go unmet as our nation continues to borrow 1 billion a day as our nation continues to spend half a billion a day 500 million a day simply paying interest on the national debt meanwhile americas priorities continue to go neglected now why should deficits matter other than all of these reasons i have already given you deficits reduce economic growth we all know that look how much better the economy was in the 1990s when ve had a balanced budget deficits burden our children and our grandchildren it is wrong for us to borrow money from other countries to give tax cuts to people here earning over 400 000 a year and leave our children to pay the bill how would you like to go to the bank and tell your banker you want to borrow money to build this new house but you are not going to pay for it you are just going to leave the bills for your children you know mr banker i have got two wonderful children i am going to make sure they get a wonderful education grow up get a good job they are going to pay for this house the banker would try to have you locked up as being mentally insane yet that is how we are running our country today in fact deficits do matter because they increase our reliance on foreign lenders foreign lenders who now own over 40 percent of our debt where is this money coming from that we are borrowing 40 percent as we know some of it is coming from the social security trust fund with no provision on how or when it is going to be paid back well where is the rest of this debt coming from we are borrowing 1 billion a day where is it coming from is it coming from your hometown bank i do not think so it is coming from foreign central banks and foreign investors in fact the united states of america is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign lenders to fund our lifestyle which is give me tax cuts if i make over 400 000 a year borrow the money from china and let my kids worry about paying it back that is thd way this republican congress is running america foreign lenders foreign lenders currently hold a total of more than 2 trillion of our public debt compare this to only 23 billion in foreign holdings back in 1993 the top 10 list the top 10 current lenders america continues to pass tax cuts for folks earning over 400 000 a year with money that we are borrowing because we are borrowing 1 billion a day with money they are borrowing from whom here is the top 10 japan the united states of america owes japan 640 1 billion china 321 4 billion as my friend and a founder of the blue dogs mr tanner has so eloquently stated and pointed out before if china decides to invade taiwan the united states of america will have to go to china to borrow more money to defend taiwan the united kingdom 179 5 billion opec imagine that we wonder why gas is approaching 3 a gallon our nation has borrowed 98 billion from opec to fund tax cuts for folks in this country earning over 400 000 a year korea the united states of america has borrowed 72 4 billion from korea taiwan we have borrowed 68 9 billion the caribbean banking centers 61 7 billion hong kong 46 6 billion germany 46 5 billion and are you ready for this rounding out the top 10 countries that our nation borrows money from to fund our outofcontrol deficit spending to the tune of 1 billion a day we have now borrowed 40 1 billion from mexico now when an american family sits down around the dinner table to pay their bills and budget for their household they include all of their family obligations their mortgage their car payment their credit card bills their education expenses you name it those hardworking folks take into account the cost of a 4year education for their children not just for one year of it they take into account their car payment and how many years it is going to take to pay for that car not just to drive it for a year when they mortgage their homes they take into account how long and by what means they will be able to afford their housing not just live in it for a year and you know what they expect the same from their government and yet as we can see july 11 today los angeles times editorial entitled another mission accomplished i am not going to read all of the editorial but the first two paragraphs are worth reading the release of the white house midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets not by a fulldress presidential dogandpony show president bush plans to preside today with members of congress and invited guests in attendance by all indications including his own in his weekly radio address last saturday he plans to turn this into a celebration just in time for the fall campaign this is proof if anyone still needs it that this administration is desperate for something to boast about on mr bushs watch tripledigit budget surpluses have turned into annual tripledigit budget deficits there is no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly disparaging fact yes the report is expected to project that this years deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last years probably somewhere between 280 and 300 billion versus a 318 billion shortfall in 2005 that is not much to crow about that is an editorial that appeared today in the los angeles times entitled another mission accomplished it goes on but the point is that this administration is so desperate for some good news that they are having a celebration to celebrate that our nation is not going to borrow 318 billion as it did in 2005 it is only going to borrow between 280 and 300 billion in fiscal year 2006 i submit to you that our nation borrowing nearly 1 billion a day is nothing to celebrate now contrary to this administra special orders for the blue dog coalitions rhetoric in light of these new tion now for quite a while on a weekly numbers touted today we have yet to basis to try to deliver the message to get government spending under con the american people in an honest and trol instead of talking about 1 year straightforward way about the fiscal we should have a real plan to deal with situation of our nations government the realities of our longterm debt and i was glad to hear him deficit just like american families do talk a little bit about iraq iraq is a for their financial obligations situation that we are having a great a perfect example of this is how we debate in this country about and i are handling our obligation in iraq i think that he made the point that we believe we all support our troops i all very strongly support the men and hope we do i have got a

debate about the who continue to serve our country in policy iraq afghanistan and elsewhere is appalling to me as a where i disagree with this president person who wore the uniform during is on the point of accountability this the vietnam era to see those members president this republican congress is of the house of representatives and sending 279 million of your tax money the unitedstates senate or anybody that might to iraq every day and yet if you ask oppose the policy that the united him to be accountable for it if you ask states government has to have them him for a plan on how that money is called unpatriotic so i appreciate the being spent and how it will win the gentleman from arkansas bringing up peace and ultimately bring our men that point and women in uniform home he will i also came here today tell you you are being unpatriotic to talk a little bit about fiscal responthat is where i disagree with this sibility and to assist my friend from president arkansas in talking about the national we just entered our fourth year in debt i find it appalling to this war and i believe if we are going hear the partisan political rhetoric to send 279 million of your tax money that goes on in these chambers rhetto iraq every day this administration oric which celebrates a federal budget and this republican congress should be annual deficit of 300 billion held accountable for how that money is now most of us that have run a busibeing spent ness know that at the but we are still finding it piecemeal end of the day your revenues have to we are still excluding the cost of the match your expenditures or else you war from our annual spending process either have to borrow money with a we are passing a number of supple longterm plan to pay it back or a mental appropriation bills to pay for it shortterm plan and show your banker that mask the wars true cost it is how you can pay it back that year time it is past time that this adminis this administration

important that we look at these increases that have happened for a million veterans for the fourth year in a row the budget rises health care costs for 1 million veterans by imposing new fees for most of them veterans cost will rise some 2 6 billion over the next 5 years and also drive at least 200 000 veterans out of assistance it will double the copayments for prescription drugs from 8 to 15 and impose an enrollment fee of 250 a year for a category 7 or 8 veteran who makes very little makes 26 000 a year i think it is also important for us to look at the increases in health care costs for military retirees the budget increased tricare health care premiums which is the health care provided to the military for 3 1 million for the nations military retirees under 65 i think it is important that we look at these premiums and look at what they are costing the folks that signed up to defend this country and allow us to salute one flag i think it is also important for us to look at what we are talking about on this side of the aisle the gi bill of rights for the 21st century that has been offered here on the democratic side will just do the reverse as it relates to what i just mentioned it makes health care accessible and affordable for our veterans and improves veterans health care it improves mental health for returning soldiers a number of the ieds improvised explosive devices i think is going to affect a number of our troops those that have fallen victim to it and survived injured those that have witnessed ieds going off those that have to worry every day when they drivedown one of the streets in iraq will they be hit by an ied some of that stuff is going to come back home and it is home and we need to be able to deal with it on a psychological standpoint because it affects many of our families these are individuals that have signed up and said they wanted to serve our country and they are serving it also blocks the increase in prescription drug copayments and the enrollment fee for veterans i think it is important that we do that and on this side of the aisle we have that legislation that has been put forth through our frustration of the fact that we cant work in a bipartisan way the only way we can work in a bipartisan way is if the republican leadership allows bipartisanship to work in the house now how does that happen well when you have a conference committee how about inviting the democratic members to that conference committee or at least letting us know where the meeting is we have day after day especially this time of year when we have a number of pieces of legislation stacked up on top of one another and i just want to make sure that i break this down so everyone understands when we pass a bill here in the house and the senate passes a similar bill they have what they call a conference committee and that conference committee sits down and works out the differences between those bills well that is not a common thing here in the house yes it would be a majority of republicans that will be on that conference committee but there are some democrats on that conference committee and we have a number of democrats when the meeting is set and the decision is made that are not even told about it that is not working in a bipartisan way and that is why our democratic leader has said that when democrats take control of this house we will work in a bipartisan way and we will make sure that the american people are represented if they have a republican representing them here then they will be represented because guess what it will not be a stonewall it will be a democracy in the way that we are supposed to carry out business here in this house of making sure that everyone benefits that is true bipartisanship it also provides benefits to veterans who have earned and deserve respect it ends the disability veterans tax it reduces waiting time on disability claimants and also expands outreach to veterans now this is very very important we are talking about individuals coming back and moving back into their community going to church or synagogue or what have you to mosque what have you and when they come back home to their families we are saying that we want a government and the department of veterans affairs that will work with that veteran will work with that family in making sure that because they signed up he or she signed up to go out on behalf of this country and fight on behalf of this country that we have their back that is the least that we can do that is what this gi bill of rights of the 21st century will do and i would urge the members to go on housedemocrats gov and get a copy of that piece of legislation so that you can take a look at it and hopefully endorse it and hopefully help us pass it we will need that very much i said i would talk about the student loans and i think it is important we have a piece of legisla tion and when i say we the democratic side we have a piece of legislation that reverses what the republican majority has done with the endorsement of the bush administration of course whatever the president wants the republican majority in this house will give it to him earlier this year the congress cut 12 billion out of the federal student loan program in order to help finance tax breaks for the wealthiest americans i think it is also important that most of the savings generated from the cuts to student loans continues the practice of forcing students and parents to borrow in many cases to pay for the expensive increase in the rates as relates to student loans by increasing college loans parents have to go out and borrow well now the republican majority is pushing their philosophy on the american people because the republican majority has decided to take away from the student aid and student loan program to give special interest tax breaks to wealthy individuals here in the united states of america the american people are now forced to go to the credit union they are forced to put their house up even a little bit more to pay for college because this majority coupled with the presidents policies has done this we are going to reverse that we are going to reduce and replenish the dollars that were taken out of the budget and were placed in special interest projects that the republican majority did and it is called reversing the raid on student aid act it is h r 5150 it would help make college more affordable it would cut interest rates in half as relates to the borrowers those that are borrowing money and also it would subsidize student loans from a fixed rate of 6 8 to a fixed rate of 3 4 it also cuts the rates on parent loans for undergraduate students from a fixed rate of 8 5 to a fixed rate of 4 25 i think it is important for us to look at those numbers because that is a drastic cut taking us back to families being able to afford to send their kids to college under the bill a typical undergraduate student has something like 17 500 in debt and would save 5 600 over the life of his or her loan i think it is important for us to look at that and that is the complete opposite of what has been put forth thus far now i think it is important for us to look at the issue on energy but i wanted to make sure i went through my list here that i said i would go through we talked about fiscal responsibility we have talked about veterans we have also talked about making college more affordable and yes we are on the issue of energy i think when you start looking at energy you cant look at investing in the middle east we want to invest in the midwest when we invest in the midwest it is investing in america and not just investing in special interests the republican majority way of doing things and also the bush white house way of doing things is to sit down with oil companies and cut secret deals to have them write the energy policy in this country to trust oil companies to make the decisions and run the energy policy here in the united states of america well the folks didnt sign up for oil companies to have a vote here on this floor the american people didnt go vote one early tuesday morning to allow someone from exxonmobil to come in here and vote on the floor case in point again washington post thirdparty validator november 16 2005 front page white house documents showed executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long suspected by environmentalists but denied as recently as november of 2005 last week by industry officials testifying before congress the document obtained this week by the washington post shows that officials from exxonmobil corp and phillips shell oil company and b p of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides who were developing a national energy policy part of which became law part of which is still being debated here in congress i think it is important that we look at it from that standpoint and while i am on the individuals who are saying that they want to help so much in alternative fuels take a look at this nothing like thirdparty validators i love them i really do i love thirdparty validators because the reason you have to have them is that some of this stuff is just hard to believe someone may be in their office saying i do not know what that member from florida is talking about right now well i want to show them as many thirdparty validators as possible because it is truly unbelievable when i was elected tocongress some4 years ago i didnt think we would even be in the posture we are in now because i thought maybe bipartisanship would prevail or common sense on behalf of the country would prevail but what has happened is that because special interests through the k street project where special interests had an opportunity to have access into this process that was socalled no longer going on we are where we are now that article i just read and here is a picture of a gas pump we talk about alternative fuels and we have ceos going on the today show and all these other little shows and all talking about oh we believe in alternative fuels well as you can see you have your regular special and then you have your super plus then you have this thing called e85 which is ethanol which is an alternative fuel right here in the united states of america well i want you to pay very close attention to what these two stickers are saying here basically it is saying that you cannot use your exxonmobil card to buy e85 that is interesting you can walk in that exxonmobil place and buy what a bag of chips with your card you can go in there and buy a case of soda if you want to some individuals even go in and buy a pack of cigarettes with their exxonmobil card but you cant buy e85 which is an alternative fuel now i mean yes they are a company and all and they can do what they want to do but you know what is different about exxonmobil and everyone else not just that company but oil companies in general man they are backed and certified by this republican majority here they are getting recordbreaking tax breaks and gifts from this house man they cant give the oil companies enough i mean goodness gracious access in the white house they get to sit down with the administration and talk about how it should be written on this line this is what we want no we shouldnt do that because you know i dont know now i am not a member of congress with a conspiracy theory but recordbreaking profits recordbreaking subsidiesoand gifts given to the oil industry some may say on behalf of innovation i say it has a lot to do with the recordbreaking profits especially when they do not have to spend their money spend the taxpayers money and the shareholders run away and laugh going to the bank but they are not willing to allow people who come to their station to use their exxonmobil card to buy e85 which is an alternative fuel these are the individuals who have access into this republican majority and into the white house lets talk about the profits wow lets look at this we said that meeting happened in 2001 in the white house complex in 2002 these are the oil companies record profits 34 billion in profits i think their policy is working for them 59 billion in profits i think it is getting better i think that was a good meeting 84 billion in 2004 84 billion in profits man i am glad i went to that meeting that task force in the republican congress with the rubberstamp that made that happen 113 billion wow i cant wait until the 2006 numbers when they come in i think we can go out and get about eight more lear jets and i will take that home that ive been dreaming about you know what it means it is on the backs of the taxpayers and i want to make sure everyone sees this chart and understands what is going on because i am also hopping mad i can tell you that for those of us who serve in public service we wish we would have a retirement like this after going to all those town hall meetings going out talking to all those american people and coming here early in the morning leaving late at night working every day and then here we are now i am not going to identify him as an individual i am just saying it is what it is and this is what is happening 398 million in a retirement package and 2 million in tax breaks a 2 million tax break that is how you get rewarded now it goes against logic for someone to say you know we are for finding alternative fuels and we are for saving the taxpayers money but meanwhile they are making recordbreaking profits i wonder what the speech that they give not on the today show or not on one of the news shows i wonder what the speech is that they give before their shareholders 0j 1715 the speech that they are giving is saying thanks to the republican majority in the house thanks to the president of the united states the future looks good we are going to have a great year i think it is important for us to look at investing in the midwest versus the middle east and e85 is a big part of the plan i want to bring members attention to this document that they can find on housedemocrats gov and how we can start making ourselves energy independent in a matter of years its not just a philosophy and not just a speech it is not someone just saying maybe one day we could but saying we can in this document it says we are looking to increase production of americanmade biofuels using things like corn and sugarcane sugar beets things that we have right here coal alternative fuels that we have here in the united states we do not need to go to foreign countries and hear from people from south america and the middle east and having the president say its not us it is the fact that the american people are addicted to oil i mean that is a statement that i think you need to let sink in it also will make sure that the biodiesel that we have a way to be able to increase that expand tax credits for ethanol and biodiesel through 2015 and increase tax benefits to small biofuel producers it expands also the market for distribution of biofuels that is going to be important oil companies are just not going to do it because it is the right thing to do we are going to have to make them do it so we can wean ourselves off of this addiction to oil we want to give them an alternative we do not just want to talk about it we want to give the american people an alternative so they can move in that direction we talk about increasing the number of gas stations offering e85 through new initiatives and requirements to make sure that we get the oil companies to do so in 7 years 75 percent of all cars made in america would be flex fuel cars those are cars that can take the e85 and can take regular gas i think it is important for us to head in that direction i think it is important for the future of our country and i think it is important to have a true debate and a true philosophy towards alternative fuels and saving money now i think it is important for us to be able to do the things that we talk about and we preach about the republican majority is going to have to drop this stamp it is going to have to give it up you are going to have to go to group and say we can no longer rubber stamp whatever the president of the united states sends to the congress the president wants tax cuts for wealthy americans they have to say mr president we cannot do it now for the republican majority to have group it is going to have to make a change in philosophy they may have to work in a bipartisan way they may even have to take a democratic proposal the payasyougo philosophy and make a change i personally feel the republican majority is not capable of doing that i have been on this floor going on 3 years if i thought it made a difference in the republican majority and encouraging them to work in a bipartisan way then i would feel a little more encouraged but i do not i think the republican majority knows exactly what the 30something working group talks about when we come to the floor we talk about fiscal responsibility and respecting hardworking americans we talk about making sure that we do right by our children and that we educate our children at all levels whether it be k12 experience higher education postgraduate making sure that we have the workforce to compete with other countries that are competing against us i am not talking about competing against the school down the street or the school in the other county we are competing against other countries as it relates to math and the sciences that is talk for the republican majority we have a true mission we have the will and desire on this side through our innovation agenda which is on housedemocrats gov the republican majority has to stop rubber stamping and i can tell you right now they cant help it they just continue to hit the rubber stamp lets not even have a committee hearing let us just get this bill to the floor and get it out because that is what the president wants we have a number of issues that the republican congress has rubber stamped one was 1 05 trillion in recordbreaking borrowing from foreign nations rubber stamped no problem deficits as far as the eye can see yes you can have all of the study groups and all of the folks that write documents and you can have all of the republican members come to this floor but the reality is that this congress has overseen the largest increase in the deficit in the history of the republic period up the newspaper its there the republican congress the only way i think that the republican congress is going to change its ways is when we have real leadership in this house and the only way we do that is when the democratic caucus becomes the majority caucus in this house on this floor to put in the policies that need to be placed in lhe statute books in the budget in committee and making sure that we put this country back on the fiscal track it should be on how can i say that with boldness because we have done its almost like a job application someone tells you they can do something and you dont see it on their r~sum6 that they have actually done it it is hard to believe they can do it it is on our r~sum without one republican vote balancing the budget i think it is also important to get the republican congress of the rubber stamp so youre making sure that they dont have the ability to rubber stamp when you have the ability to rubber stamp you are in the majority and that is what the american people are going to have to speak to i am hoping we are able to see some change in philosophy here in the house and we encourage the members if you want to share your thoughts or comments or you have other alternative ideas we want to hear them because we believe in working in a bipartisan way house democrats gov 30somethingworkinggroup with that i would like to thank our working group that met earlier this week a couple of days ago and i would also like to thank the staff and thank everyone that takes part in what we do and why we come to the floor i would like to thank the democratic leader for the time it was an honor addressing the house of representatives"], [0.13234609365463257, 0.8676539063453674, 1, "i thank the distinguished gentleman from new york our ranking member on the ways and means committee for yielding me the time i thank you and our colleagues on the committee on the democratic side for the excellent work you did in putting forth the democratic alternative today you have made an excellent case for your substitute and indictment against what the republicans are doing let us talk about what is happening here today a few weeks ago right before thanksgiving there was a bill on the floor which was the republican budget bill so bad was this bill in terms of it not representing the values of our country that the religious community gathered in the rotunda of the capitol of the united states and they prayed that this congress would make the right decisions and reject the republican budget proposal they asked some questions about why we would be giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country while taking food out of the mouths of americas children they said they were going to draw a moral line ii the sand because a budget should be a statement of our national values and what we care about in our country should be reflected in that budget today we are talking about a tax bill which is handinglove part of the reconciliation that the republicans are putting forth so embarrassed were they by their own budget and so embarrassed were they by this tax bill that they had to have 3 weeks come between the two of them so that the american people would separate the cause and effect of what they were doing with their budget bill that was poor in its values poor in its priorities and increasing our deficit because of this tax bill today yesterday they engaged in another sham which was to pretend that they were giving alternative minimum tax relief for middleclass families in america if they cared about middleclass families in america they would have put that in this bill today which has the full protection as it goes over to the senate they know that that bill they passed yesterday has no weight in the senate it does not have the protection of the parliamentary process on the senate side and the same applies to what they did to try to give the illusion that they were helping our men and women in combat so that they would qualify for the lowincome tax credit if they cared about them they would have them in the bill today this budget as i said should be a statement of our national values and while we talk about that let us talk about what those values are america has always cherished the value of opportunity and one place where that is possible for more americans is in the issue of education taking these two bills together we are giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america while we are putting a burden on our young people by saying that they will pay 5 800 more in their student loans so that we can give tax cuts to people making over 1 million a year that is not a statement of our national values that takes from our children their opportunity when we should be expanding it fairness fairness has always been a cherished american value fairness we see that during the last 5 years these 5 years of the bush administration 7 million more people in our country go to sleep hungry without adequate food because they cannot afford to buy food seven million more people an increase of 12 percent and what does this combination of reconciliation in order to give tax cuts to people making over 1 million a year that cuts food stamps and takes many tens of thousand of children off the school lunch program do as the religious community said how can we as a country give tax cuts to the wealthiest and take food out of the mouths of our children that is not about fairness fairness is an american value community america has always been about community alexis de tocqueville said it about the origins of our country and community means safe neighborhoods the safety of our people homeland security and the rest we are not putting adequate resources to cops on the beat or anything else in order for us to give these tax cuts at the high end that is not about community that is totally unfair and it is diminishing opportunity let us take the value of responsibility personal responsibility fiscal responsibility which should be the order of the day in this conversation here the combination of their tax bill and their budget bill in reconciliation which i do not blame them for separating by 3 weeks because it is a total embarrassment with that they are increasing the deficit they are increasing the deficit by 20 billion in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest americans they are putting the burden of debt on americas children individual debt with their student loans and fiscal debt in terms of our national debt and what our kids will be burdened with it is just totally irresponsible and at the same time increases the deficit democrats support payasyougo no deficit spending if something is important to you figure out how to pay for it but do not make my children and grandchildren have to pay for it or anybodys children and grandchildren have to pay for it every opportunity i get i want to sing the praises of the clinton administration coming out of that administration we were on a trajectory of 5 6 trillion with a tr dollars in surplus in the years of the bush administration that has been almost fully reversed over 4 trillion in deficit a swing of around 10 trillion an incredible burden on the future a tax on our childrens future and this is the party of fiscal responsibility republicans have completely abdicated that the democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility we showed we can do it then we can do it again we should not today be catering to this appetite for deficits that the republicans cannot seem to get over it is just absolutely immoral immoral for us to heap those deficits on our children i want to commend my colleagues on the democratic side for what they have done and put into their proposal the house democrats are committed to an america that works for everyone not just the privileged few our democratic substitute reflects the values of community by shielding the middleclass americans from the alternative minimum tax in a bill that really counts not in some suspension of yesterday that has no weight in the conference with the senate and it provides tax relief the democratic alternative does for our soldiers in combat in the bill that really matters as well the democratic substitute demonstrates fairness by not adding to the deficit and it creates opportunities spurring economic growth generating jobs and supporting our small businesses our democratic members on the committee have eloquently made an indictment against this budget which is immoral because of the 70 billion in tax cuts mostly for americas wealthiest the republican budget decimates the very initiatives that middleclass americans rely upon to get ahead the poor suffer the rich benefit the middle class is paying the bill the number of people without health insurance has increased 4 years in a row people are hungry a 12 percent increase the number of people who do not have health insurance has grown they are cutting 45 billion in medicaid a health insurance program that is mostly for americas poor children many of them katrina survivors alexis de tocqueville talked about community in america he wrote back to the french america is great because america is good if america ever ceases to be good he concluded america will cease to be great this is a moment that no one in this body wants to hasten we all want america to be great and america to be good together we can do better by returning to our fundamental values to maintain americas goodness by rejecting this immoral tax bill"]], "top_incorrect":

you have a rainy day fund you are the only family in america that went out and borrowed money to put into a rainy day fund because you do not have any money the american people do not have any money in this government all they have is debt and you want a bill to help you to keep from spending again what you need is a 12step program on spending it is called intestinal fortitude it is called having a spine it is called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or even billions of dollars that you did not work to earn then this congress wants to serve you but if you get up every day and go to work to earn a living then dont expect any help from this congress the message all of this sends could not be clearer the republicans value wealth not work if you hold up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this congress to treat americas working families with the respect and dignity they have earned the choice to provide hundreds of billions more in tax breaks for the ultrawealthy is shameful its even more shameful to do it while steadfastly refusing to raise the minimum wage"], [0.8601906299591064,

committee overall this bill is a step backward this bill will not lessen our dependence on foreign oil and it will do nothing to reduce energy prices it will increase the deficit weaken our economy compromise our national security and endanger our environment the supporters of this bill are certainly right about one thing we desperately need a good national energy policy this measure does not pass that test our growing dependence on foreign oil puts us at the mercy of unstable and unfriendly foreign regimes it gives terrorists additional targets and puts money in their hands it weakens the dollar by worsening the balance of trade we would start every day 500 millionplus in the hole on our balance of trade because of the imported oil it pumps money out of the domestic economy and into the hands of those who would wish us ill in short our oil dependence represents a significant and growing threat to our national security and national security should be first and foremost in the minds and hearts of everyone in this chamber so what do we do to reduce our dependence on foreign oil yes we need to increase the supply of fossil and nuclear and renewable energy but most importantly we need to become more energy efficient and does this bill do to make us more energy efficient virtually nothing the federal energy information administration found that last years energy bill would have almost no impact on energy demand and energy prices and that bill if anything made more of an effort to tame consumption the alliance for an energy efficient economy has estimated that this years energy bill would not save a single barrel of oil by 2020 that is both tragedy and farce we know how to treat our oil addiction we can make appliances more energy efficient without inconveniencing anyone we can make our cars more efficient without sacrificing safety my cafe amendment would reduce oil consumption in 2020 by 2 million barrels a day that is more than twice the amount that is expected per day from drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge what does this bill do instead of trying to make us more energy efficient at a time of fiscal crises and record oil prices the bill provides new mandatory spending that will go directly to the oil industry and it provides mandatory breaks for the oil industry on royalties the bill provides massive tax breaks for profitable oil companies and next to nothing for new technologies that could help wean us from foreign oil here is what the president said last week on that issue with 55 oil we dont need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore the presidents budget devoted 72 percent of its proposed energy tax incentives to alternatives this bill provides just 6 percent to alternatives while providing more than a billion dollars in additional tax breaks we would not have to look far to come up with better ideas while the house has been writing a bill based on ideological purity rather than careful analysis others have come forward with bipartisan sensible balanced approaches to energy policy groups like the national commission on energy policy and the alliance to save energy and the energy future coalition have all offered carefully considered proposals that could have formed the basis of an effective bill with republican credentials but instead we have decided to close our minds and open our purse in a way that will harm taxpayers and consumers and weaken our economic health and national security we can do better we ought to do better we have an obligation to do better let us defeat this

its plans to enrich uranium by building its centrifuge program and constructing a heavywater reactor which could provide plutonium for nuclear weapons additionally the iaea revealed that iran was in

been providing on this issue i rise today to discuss what is one of the what i call tragic burdens one of the greatest tragic burdens on the american family and this is the costly complex tax code this friday april 15 is tax day for millions of americans who will spend countless hours this week trying to comply with our unbelievably complex tax laws at the outset i want to make something very clear to the american people tonight let me make it clear that it is democrats who you will see tonight who are taking the leadership it will be democrats on this floor of the congress tonight who are taking the leadership to make our tax system fairer less complicated and simpler now we all know that over the last 4 years this governmeit has been getting bigger under the republicans the deficits have soared under the republicans social security is coming under direct attack and attempting to be dismantled and privatized by the republicans and our tax system has gotten more complicated more unfair and complex under the republicans there has been a growing unfairness in the tax code and an astronomically exploding national debt trillions upon trillions of dollars and growing each year but it is democrats who are here tonight providing the leadership for tax fairness for tax relief for tax simplification and most importantly for reducing taxes on working american families americans are doubletaxed by thetime and expense that it takes to do their taxes for example individuals businesses taxexempt public and private entities spend nearly 6 billion hours complying with the tax code nearly 60 percent of taxpayers currently use a tax professional to prepare their taxes compared to only 40 percent ift 1990 a typical taxpayer knows that a competent tax professional does not work for free so it is costing taxpayers an estimated 100 billion each year in accounting fees and the value of their time to complete their tax returns now i am reading a very interesting book by thomas friedman and it is called the world is flat and in this book he talks about a phenomenal situation that takes place largely because of the paperwork and the complexity of our tax returns and preparing them he points out very clearly in a chapter called while i was sleeping that over in india a burgeoning industry is taking place preparing americans taxes outsourcing jobs in 2001 it was 50 000 2002 it was 100 000 2003 it was 400 000 and 2005 it is projected to be over one million not just jobs but our precious preparation of our taxes being outsourced i am here to tell you that our failure to simplify our tax code is causing a major transformation of our accounting profession taxpayers are losing money due to the complexities of the system the government accountability office estimates that americans overpay their taxes by an estimated 1 billion a year because they fail to claim deductions about a quarter of americans who are eligible for the earned income tax credit fail to claim it due to complexities this is terrible it is a tragedy and we must make our tax code easier for the american people make it easier for them to figure it out as an entrepreneur who started a successful small business i was not surprised to learn that the irs estimates that the average selfemployed taxpayer has the greatest compliance burden of almost 60 hours to prepare his or her taxes it is no wonder that small business owners overpaid their taxes by 18 billion in 2000 and 2001 according to the gao this is unacceptable we do not need to take this any further considering these statistics is it any wonder why 70 percent of americans recently polled believed their federal taxes are too complicated in that same associated press poll about half of the respondents would prefer
