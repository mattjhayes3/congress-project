0, "let me just take a few minutes at the outset to respond to some of the allegations that have been made not only with respect to the luken amendment but also to explain the terms of my amendment as to what it does the gentleman from ohio has made the allegation and has actually stated that his amendment is a moratorium on ftc regulations this is no moratorium amendment that the gentleman from ohio has offered the gentleman from ohio has offered an amendment that would permanently exempt all state licensed professions from ftc law enforcement now despite the use of the word moratorium in the bills by the introducer of this bill and this amendment the exemption would be just as permanent as any other legislation that is adopted by the congress i want to point out to the members and i hope that they are listening back in their offices or wherever they may be to clarify the number and the types of professions who would be exempted from ftc jurisdiction should this amendment pass it may include lawyers dentists physicians engineers accountants architects nurses chiropractors pharmacists actuaries optometrists veterinarians podiatrists clinical psychologists surveyors beauticians and i could go on and on any profession which is licensed at the state level could conceivably be exempted from the ftc consumer protection laws i do not think that is what we want to do the amendment that i am offering would also limit the commission authority the allegation has been made somehow that the compromise that i am offering would somehow expand ftc authority over jurisdiction this is not true it does just the opposite it does limit the federal trade commission authority over the professions i recognize that the states have a very important role in regulating professionals they currently regulate the educational licensing and quality of care rendered by various professions within their borders i think that that state regulation is necessary to protect the health safety and welfare of their citizens and i do not believe that the commission should be involved in those matters my substitute says that the ftc should not interfere with state laws or regulations that for example do thisthat set out the qualifications that someone must meet in order to take a professional licensing exam set standards for the professional school accreditation it would also say the ftc could not interfere with the determination of the content of licensing examination my amendment would also say that the ftc could not interfere with state laws or regulations that have the effect of reviewing incompetent or unethical professionals under peer review programs or to decide that only certain types of professionals may perform certain procedures and also my amendment includes a limitation on ftcs antitrust authority which again defers to the state role specifically my amendment and that is found in the early part of my amendment which was just read by the clerk incorporates what is known as the state action doctrine into the ftc act that would insure that states can establish policy within their borders which the ftc could not callenge under its antitrust authority this restriction in the law would provide antitrust immunity for professionals from ftc action if the state were to enact for example laws declaring that only certain professionals can perform particular procedures laws that seek to control costs by regulating professional pricing practices or laws that protect consumers from incompetent or unethical professionals now apparently the controversial part of my amendment that is objected to by the gentleman from ohio and those who are supporting his amendment is the fact that my amendment does preserve ftc authority to challenge a state law that prescribes a business or commercial practice for professionals and which is anticompetitive i will hasten to point out that the commission under the terms of my substitute must meet the burden of proof for both elements before it could proceed either on a casebycase action or in any rulemaking in other words my amendment would preserve the ftc authority to challenge deceptive acts or practices where it is proved that a business or commercial act or practices have been carried on and i think that we should preserve that narrow amount of the ftc authority there are certain examples of professional conduct that the ftc has challenged the gentleman from new jersey has already enumerated some of these there was a texas case for example where local doctors threatened to boycott a towns hospital emergency room if the hospital recruited a new physician to the town on terms that the physicians did not like and there was another case in florida where the local medical association acted to prohibit truthful advertising by doctors and in effect they were trying to block the physicians from truthfully advertising whether or not they accepted medicare assignments as payment in full advertising whether they accepted credit cards or advertising whether the spanish language was spoken in their office as a second language or advertising whether or not senior citizens could get a discount and these are business or commercial practices they have nothing to do with the quality of care but it is that kind of restraint that stifles competition drives up health care costs and it is especially injurious to the elderly to the poor and to the working people for that reason i strongly urge the adoption of my substitute and rejection of the amendment of the gentleman from ohio"],
