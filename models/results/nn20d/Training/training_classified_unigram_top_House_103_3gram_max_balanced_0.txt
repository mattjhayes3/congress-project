distinguished chairman the gentleman from massachusetts for yielding me the time let me respond to what my good friend has just laid out as the scenario for consideration of the bills before us there is a single legislative measure before us but in effect we have four bills before us the origin of this is a bill called common cents it is not a to z it is h r 4414 which contains a number of budget process reforms the basic reform here proposed was we take emergencies one at a time that an emergency spending bill according to h r 4434 would only contain emergency spending related to one single emergency when i took up this matter several weeks ago to try to break down parts of this and bring budget reform measures to the floor i looked into this particular provision and what we found was that over the last 5 years from 1991 through 1994 both years inclusive we had funded 150 emergencies if we include desert storm if this particular provision in h r 4434 the common cents bill had been in effect we would have been required to enact 150 separate laws to provide for emergency funding whereas only 15 had to be enacted to provide for these 150 emergencies there were nine supplemental appropriation acts five regular appropriation acts and one continuing resolution with those pieces of legislation we covered all 150 emergencies i prepared a bill which said basically that stenholmkasich says today namely that emergency bills can only include emergency spending if they include nonemergency spending they cannot exceed the discretionary spending cap but basically the object was to keep emergency spending bills limited to emergencies although they could inelude multiple emergencies i was prepared to file that bill and i had shared it with my colleagues the gentleman from texas the gentleman from minnesota and the gentleman from ohio when the committee on appropriations convinced me that there at least is a argument a strong argument to be made for the existing procedure because there is a need for flexibility they gave me two very current contemporary examples for example rwandan aid the foreign appropriations bill that is moving through congress right now includes rwandan aid 350 million it was a useful vehicle for loading that emergency spending item on and it is completely germane to the subject of the bill the second example aid for georgia flood relief the laborhhs appropriations bill was amended in the other body to include aid for georgia flood relief and i am sure the georgians are glad that that vehicle was available because we are near the end of the fiscal year and i am sure fema has probably drawn down substantially on its available obligatable balances so that vehicle was used which is a nonemergency spending bill to include emergency spending which is desperately needed in georgia the committee on appropriations said this sort of flexibility on occasion more often than not is a very very desirable convenience to have we tie our hands we make our process very inflexible when we need it most responding to emergencies and disasters if we strictly and religiously limit emergency spending bills or nonemergency bills so that the two cannot be mixed consequently i filed h r 4906 to allow that position to be argued on the floor what we have today is an array of all the logical positions on the spectrum concerning emergency spending first of all that is that particular position it is basically current law butit provides and underscores and emphasizes that nonemergency items should not be included if they are truly extraneous if they are simply being piggybacked and it does so by allowing an expedited easy procedure for a motion to strike when nonemergency items are included in emergency spending bills that come to the floor second the committee on rules has made in order the johnson amendment the gentleman from texas would have us when we appropriate emergency spending in 1 year in the next fiscal year look back take anything in excess of the caps for that year and take it out of that years discretionary spending he has a lookback provision the castle amendment has a lookforward the castle amendment which is a third alternative has a lookforward provision it says let us determine the average over a certain period of time 5 fiscal years which we have spent upon emergency and disaster projects let us average that out and let us reserve that amount as a likely contingency every year he would have us put away into a reserve account and appropriate out of that reserve account when and if emergencies occur stenholmpennykasich is still another alternative it provides that emergency spending bills shall be related exclusively to emergencies but unlike the original version which they were supporting here under the common cents bill they agree that there could be multiple emergencies include in a single bill we have before us today 4 clear choices the reason i filed h r 4906 was to complete the spectrum to allow the committee on appropriations to come here and make the argument they made to me that this flexibility is needed and anyone who has ever faced a disaster and found fema with no money in its pocket no expendable balances on its books knows that we need flexibility in the face of an emergency that argument will be made in the well of the house today because h r 4906 is the base bill but other arguments will be made the procedure that we have laid out is completely logical completely fair for the consideration of each one of these with 4 alternatives before us i do not know a better procedure that the kingofthehill procedures for taking each one of them in its own term i think what we have here is a fair procedure and one that allows for full consideration of the whole spectrum of ideas of how we should budget for emergency spending"], [1.0699033737182617e-05, 0.4999893009662628, 1, "it is 43 700 000 that is for the shortterm debt

ideashould we build a space statioh last weeks vote was evidence of continued skepticism over the need for the station but today we must ask ourselves another questioncan we afford it with a national debt of 4 trillion that will grow by almost 300 billion this year can we really afford the 100 billion it will probably cost to build and operate the space station now i know this is a tough vote for some of my colleagues for some this might be an issue of nasas direction the viability of our aerospace industry or maybe even jobs in their district those are all legitimate concerns but in the last couple of weeks or so we have taken votes on amendments to cut programs in the name of reducing the deficit and almost everyone around here has come down to the house floor to talk about the importance of cutting spending when we voted to cut funding for former speakers of the house and for former presidents those amendments took hours to debate and saved us less than 12 million we cut 2 million from batf and 4 million from the customs service time and time again these and other measures were characterized as votes for fiscal responsibility and deficit reduction but those votes barely even nibbled away at the deficit congress would have to pass 300 amendments the size of the unitedstates customs service amendment every year for the next 20 or 30 years to equal the savings in this amendment my question to you is do you really want to cut the deficit or are you just pretending for those of you who are looking for real deficit reduction a cut that matters this year and next year and for years to come this is your chance killing the worthless space station will save us more than 1 billion this year tens of billions of dollars over the next 20 years finally today my office received some information on jobs that the space station provides to new york state according to nasa 19 38 million in station contracts in new york provides 153 jobs that is supposed to be a reason for me and my new york colleagues to support this boondoggle153 jobs at a cost of a whopping 126 666 apiece to the taxpayer if what we are looking for is a jobs program making effective use of the

enough requirements that epa be structured to abate the only criticisms that have been found by legitimate congressional investigations are in the bill now i have heard a lot of complaints from my

daily basis on their issuance of regulations but this is not a substantive bill and i dont believe this house wants to get a rule out of the committee on rules which would require this house to then

judgment and wise balance can be before this body when the legislation comes before us the rule is fair the rule allows the house to consider all the questions that it should of a procedural and structural and an organizational structure with regard to epa i would urge my colleagues to follow the leadership of the committee on rules vote through the rule and then if they have complaints on
