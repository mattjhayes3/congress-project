pieces of consumer legislation that congress will address this year anyone who has moved from one area of the country to another can readily attest to the problems that occasionally arise in trying to establish a new checking account several years ago one of my staff members in the midst of a move from nebraska to washington opened a checking account in a washington area bank with a cashiers check from her nebraska bank she was told that she could not take money from the account and that it would not earn interest for 2 weeks this situation is also a frequent problem for college students who move away from home all too frequently i hear stories about college student constituents who deposit checks from their parents in their own accounts and then do not have access to the money for 2 or 3 weeks for many students that can mean a lot of lean days h r 28 strikos a reasonable compromise between the concerns of banks and depositors this bill will limit the number of days that a bank can restrict access to funds deposited in an account the bill insures consumers more timely access to their funds by implementing availability schedules over the next 3 years that will reduce holds on checks after a 3year phasein period deposits made by checks must be available for withdrawal after no more than one intervening business day while nonlocal checks must be available after no more than 4 intervening business days this bill would also provide for next day availability for deposits made by government checks checks of 100 and under bankissued checks such as certified checks and checks drawn on the same institution while this bill will speed the availability of funds for a depositor protections are also afforded banks and other depository institutions the availability schedules do not apply for deposits made during the first 30 days after an account is opened by a new depositor or for the portion of a deposit which exceeds 5 000 in any 1 business day the bill also contains a provision which allows for an exception to the mandated availability schedule if the depository institution has reasonable cause to believe that the check is uncollectible although congress addressed

to research i think the gentleman from new york just said it very succinctly when he said let us continue with the research let me try to put this in some political and historical perspective being a congressman from an area that is considered to be a source of these pollutants not too many years ago those who were elected to congress from my area of the country denied that acid rain exists not too many years after that there were candidates from all over the country who would say such things as acid rain is caused by trees do we remember that remark all of these different things have happened in the evolution of americas attitude toward acid rain i am prepared to say as i stand here today representing an area that is rife with highsulfur coal that acid rain does exist that in fact sulfur emissions have something to do with it and that in fact we have to work on this problem to solve it there are people who are very sensitive around the country who say that the solution is obvious close down those plants find a different source of fuel one that does not have sulfur in it and move forward but let me suggest to the members that if they have strong feelings i understand them because i have a good environmental record those strong feelings of members in the northeast about the damage to the environment are shared by me in the midwest but i look across the faces of literally thousands of coal miners that i represent who will be out of work if we take that approach it is a simple approach maybe it would work i say maybe but in so doing it would wreak havoc on the economy of the area in which i live what the gentleman from illinois and i are trying to do in supporting this amendment is to say to the members that we accept the responsibility of moving forward but for goodness sakes do not ask us to take an approach that would give us a solution that could wreak havoc on the local economy and it is an approach that could fail what if we followed that program and found out in fact that the sources of the pollution are totally different than those we suspect today there is good scientific research available today that suggests to us that perhaps the largest polluters are not the largest contributors those who are polluting and living in the areas that happen to be in a certain air stream or wind flow may cause more problems for the northeast and canada so we may get more problems from smaller polluters than the larger polluters that we are going after let us take a look at this problem dispassionately objectively and scientifically but please

of the victims of our nations crime concern for americas crime vicitms has been a consistent priority of mine dating from long before the enactment of the victims of crime act of 1984 and the victim witness protection act of 1982both of which i sought and actively supported among its provisions h r 5210 reauthorizes the victims of crime act of 1984 the funding mechanism of which had expired on october first of this year beyond merely renewing the funding for this worthy program h r 5210 makes significant improvements to the act which will redound to the benefit not only of crime victims but also society at large first h r 5210 reauthorizes the act for 6 years second h r 5210 will raise the ceiling which has heretofore been placed over the fund so as to permit more money for victims the act itself established a crime victims fund made up primarily of federal criminal fines forfeited appearance and bail bonds and forfeited collateral the current ceiling on the fund provides that receipts in excess of 110 000 shall return to the general fund of the treasury h r 5210 will raise that level to 125 million for the first 3 years of the reauthorization and to 150 million for the second 3 years receipts in excess of 110 million shall be divided in two equal 47 5 percent portions for grants to states for compensation and assistance the remainder will be devoted to federal crime victims the current victims of crime act requires that states give priority in its assistance grants to programs for victims of sexual assault spousal abuse or child abuse while these priorities are and continue to be necessary h r 5210 provides that states must certify that funds will be made available for previously underserved victims this is intended to promote the broadest effort possible to assist victims of violent crime and to ensure that no category of victim is ignored the director of the office for victims of crime is to promulgate guidelines to implement this requirement after consultation with a broad spectrum of public officials and private representatives so as to provide flexibility to the states in determining the populations of crime victims that may be underserved there are many ways in which a state may ensure that its previously underserved victims populations are considered it might be useful here to reference guidelines that currently arg in effect from the office for victims of crime concerning victims assistance grants for priority categories for example under the guidelines a state may allocate at least 10 percent of the states voca victims assistance grant to each of the three priority categories or a state may develop criteria for ensuring that each priority category receives grants commensurate with the needs of that category or a state may require that every subprogram receiving grant money must include as a principal mission or component services to one of the priority categories loo ing at these guidelines may beuseful in deciding how a state should treat its underserved victims without requiring any particular approach i wish to highlight also the fact that h r 5210 contains a provision which i introduced as separate legislation earlier in the congress this would require that in order for a state to qualify for federal victim compensation grants it must compensate its own citizens who become victims of crime in a state which does not have a qualifying program as i indicated when i introduced that bill there are only a few states which do not have victim compensation programs but they present a gap which should be closed for as many innocent victims of crime as possible i urge my colleagues to support this legislation not only for what it will do against drugs but also for what it will do for victims of crime"]]}
