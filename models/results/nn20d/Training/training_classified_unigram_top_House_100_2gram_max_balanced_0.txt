but it is not really fair and it is not right but the new york city loan guarantees as well as the chrysler loan guarantees and others said that if a part of the economy is down in the dumps lets give some temporary government help lets lift them up and then let the private market work again that is indeed how farmer mac should work we should be giving help but we should sunset the legislation so that if a private secondary market can eventually occur so that if the agricultural sector rebounds this need not be here i was unable to prevail that view upon the committee on agriculture and faced

the increasing use and abuse of polygraphs in the workplace the effort to control the use of polygraphs in the workplace is not a new phenomenon twentytwo states and the district of columbia prohibit the use of polygraphs in the private sector while 19 states regulate their use regrettably many of these state laws are being circumvented despite these prohibitions and regulations more than 2 million polygraph tests were given last year approximately 90 percent of these tests were given by private employers although the majority of these tests were given for preemployment testing employers also use these tests to determine guilt or innoceice of current employees these tests have been used by employers to ascertain certain beliefs of employees or applicants regarding race religion or politics during the course of hearings on this legislation the principal author of the 1983 office of technology assessment report entitled the scientific validity of polygraph tests told the committee that from a scientific perspective there is little evidence to suggest that polygraph tests are e valid means of verifying an individuals truthfulness or deception a polygraph instrument cannot detect truth or deceit even in the hands of the most skilled examiner h r 1212 would protect workers who are wrongfully denied employment because of the results of these tests thousands of

cooperation and unanimously approved by the energy and commerce committee because of this gratifying degree of bipartisan support and the recent passage of similar legislation by the senate i am hopeful that we can provide a full reauthorization of federal rail safety activities for the first time in 4 years early in 1987 16 passengers traveling our northeast corridor rail route lost their lives because our safety system failed a freight locomotive with its other safety devices disabled and not equipped with the automatic train control that could have prevented the collision moved directly into the path of an amtrak passenger train with tragic results today we can take an important step to prevent such accidents in the future the rail safety improvement act of 1987 requires the installation of automatic train control on all locomotives used on the northeast corridor within the next 21 years this bill will also cure a serious deficiency in the present safety lawsthe complete absence of federal safety enforcement authority over railroad personnel under this legislation the department of transportation will have such jurisdiction and will be able to impose sanctions on proven safety violators and remove them from safetysensitive positions when we consider rail safety we need to bear in mind who are the principal victims of safety lapses including unsafe conduct on the railroads in 1985 railroad employees suffered 15 times the number of fatalities among rail passengers a major part of the hazard to rail workers comes from reckless conduct by a few of their fellow workers such as the disabling of potentially lifesaving safety devices h r 3743 makes such tampering a specific safety violation at the same time it protects workers who diligently report safety violations by giving them specific legal remedies against management retaliation the bill also maintains the confidentiality of employee safety reports and requires federal authorities to evaluate in a rulemaking proceeding the need for safety standards to protect employees who maintain railroads rightofway in sum this bill strikes a fair and reasonable balance between tho legitimate concerns of the employee and the public need to protect workers travelers and others against the unsafe actions of a few this bill also brings up to date the system of fines that the department of transportation may impose for safety violations while the department would have the usual discretion in seeking to impose fines as under present law the limit of possible fines would be increased from 2 500 to 10 000 with an exceptional fine of up to 25 000 for grossly negligent or repeated serious violations these changes will give federal authorities the sanctions needed to deter safety violations if possible and to punish violators where appropriate this bill also strikes the proper balance between broad legislative policy directives and detailed administrative implementation through agency action in several instances notably the possible inspection standards for grade crossing equipment safety standards for maintenanceofway employees and fencing standards for railroad yards the secretary of transportation is directed to take action through administrative rulemaking to issue standards as may be necessary this scheme properly recognizes that legislators are not omniscient and that safety measures should be tailored to the specific facts as brought out in a full and fair hearing the secretary will then have the usual broad discretion in deciding whether to adopt rules or standards to address any need that has been demonstrated in the factual record in this way we can be confident that any rules and standards ultimately adopted are neither too weak to address a genuine need nor overly restrictive of prudent and efficient railroad operations h r 3743 also assures adequate qualification of persons in positions vitally affecting rail safety it directs the establishment of a program of federal approval of rail carriers qualification standards for persons operating locomotives drivingrecord data stored in the national driver register would be included as a vital factor in this qualification process the bill also requires an inquiry into the possible need for federal standards governing the training of dispatchers in closing i wish to
