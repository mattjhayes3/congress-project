so tonight this is what we will do i would like to mention the mission of the naacp which is to ensure the political educational social and economic equality of all personsnot just of black people not just of people of color but of all people the naacp also desires to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination these are lofty and noble goals because we understand that we have had much racial hatred and much racial discrimination in this country and the naacp took it upon itself to eliminate as much of it as possible it has done a good job i might add lets look at a little bit of the history of the naacp back on february 12 1909 a group of people decided that it was going to do something about the lynchings that were taking place in this country literally in this country between 1889 and 1918 thousands of african americans were lynchedthousands lynching was done with mob violence people were taken to trees and they were lynched it was done a good many times with impunity no one was ever prosecuted it was a grave injustice and there were people in this country who decided that they were going to do something about this injustice among the people who met initially were mary white ovington oswald garrison villard william english walling and ida wellsbarnett these persons met and issued a clarion call some 60 persons answered that call hence the naacp was born the naacp did not have its first african american as an executive secretary until 1920 it is important for us to note that many of the founders of the naacpin fact most of themwere not of african ancestry the first executive secretaries of the organization were all persons who were of european ancestry in fact the first five executive secretaries were white they were not black in 1934 the naacp had its first black board chairpersonlouis t wright dr wright became chairperson after the naacp had had a good number of white chairpersons so the naacp has never been and is not now an organization for blacks only the naacp has always stood for an integrated society and has been an integrated organization since its inception in 1954 the naacp under the leadership and counsel of the honorable thurgood marshall who became a justice of the supreme court won the lawsuit of brown v board of education this was a giant leap forward for us because this lawsuit integrated to a certain extent schools throughout the country the word that was appropriately used at the time was desegregated these schools were ordered to be desegregated with all deliberate speed and all deliberate speed can sometimes take a lot longer than one might expect a good many years later there are still those who would contend that we have not fully integrated our school systems across the length and breadth of the country in 1955 an naacp member the honorable rosa parks an african american lady decided that she was going to take a stand and she took that stand by taking a seat she took a seat on a bus in so doing she ignited a spark that started a civil rights movement by the way there are many people who contend that she did this because she was tired well she may have been tired but she did it because she wanted to take a stand she was tired of societys relegating her to the back of the bus and she took a stand against it hence we had the montgomery bus boycott which lasted more than a year at the end of that boycott the bus linethe transportation systemwas integrated in alabama and of course later on throughout the country an interesting note on this point about the integration and desegregation of bus lines there was a threejudge panel that actually heard the litigation associated with this transportation issue on that threejudge panel there were judges who had a great debate about this but there was one frank m johnson a federal district court judge who took the position that we could apply the brown decision to public transportation this was the very first time it was done was under the leadership of that threejudge panel and by the honorable frank m johnson again i point these things out because it is important to note that there were others who were there with the naacp to help us along the way frank m johnson by the way was a republican appointee who was appointed by president eisenhower and he went on to help us to integrate schools throughout the south and integrate the department of public safety he went on to help us with the facilitation of voting rights acts and with the implementation of laws that prohibited persons from discriminating against persons in workplace environments he really played a significant role as did many other persons who were associated with the naacp in a vicarious way because i dont have evidence of his having been a member i want to move forward if i may next to 2008 i move forward to 2008 because this is when the naacp supported the passage of the emmett till unsolved civil rights crime act of 2007 there are many unsolved cases in the history of this country with reference to things that happened to african americans the naacp pushed for and supported legislation such that we can have the opportunity to bring some of the dastards to justice who have caused great harm to people who were doing no harm to anyone the naacp has fought for this in 2009 the naacp celebrated its centennial anniversary and the theme at that time was bold dreams and big victories obviously a good theme because the naacp has won many big victories in 2012 the naacp supported the smart and safe campaign which brought attention to the overpopulated prisons and mass incarceration in this country people who study these issues are well aware that in this country we have an overpopulation of persons who are incarcerated much of this has to do with mandatory sentencing laws much of it has to do with laws that allow persons who are convicted of one type of offense with drugs to receive a harsher penaltycocaine for example then if you have crack cocaine you will get a stiffer penalty as opposed to its being some other type of cocaine the point is that these harsh sentencing laws have caused a good many people to be incarcerated who quite frankly should not be incarcerated for as long as they are incarcerated some of these three strikes and you are out laws have also caused persons to go to prison for a minor offense because it happened to be the third offense so the naacp is fighting against this"], [0.820831298828125, 0.820831298828125, 0, "i thank the good doctor from tennessee i want

military forces unitedstates involvement against isis in syria fits this characterization the administration even admits that there is no comprehensive strategy in place therefore by amendment we are proposing to defund unitedstates support for the syrian rebels and move the funds to the spending reduction account last september congress allocated 500 million to train and arm syrian rebels this program however is fraught with uncertainties and doubts and the launch of the program has been less than impressive of the 15 000 syrian rebels we planned to train and equip over a 3year period so far only about 400 have been vetted and deemed ready meanwhile other syrian rebels have either disappeared from the battlefield or have defected to extremist factions and isis has expanded its ground forces its operations and its territories other jihadist factions in syria are also gaining strength and the assad regime continues its atrocities the civil war in syria has now resulted in 220 000 syrian deaths and in 11 5 million peopleover half the populationdisplaced within syria the unitedstates continues to provide by far the bulk of the military might most of it air power it is hard to imagine defeating isis without substantial ground forces to combat it at this point the defense appropriations bill includes 600 million to train and arm syrian rebels as part of this needed bootsontheground but whatever the number of syrian rebels we ultimately introduce into the battlefield they alone i believe are unlikely to turn the tide nor are these rebels expected to end the assad government even though that too is one of our stated goals history has shown that when we arm untested and difficulttovet rebel forces the weapons we provide too often wind up being aimed at our unitedstates troops i am told that the last time our country funded a foreign war through vicarious fighters was the taliban fighting against the russians in the 1970s please join us in saying no to additional funding for these untested syrian rebels unless and until congress receives clear answers to the following questions where is the accounting for the first 500 million i dont have it why isnt the second 600 million if appropriate funded by other folks in the coalition what is the objective what does success look like in the syrian civil war does victory require the end of the assad government what is the comprehensive strategy for defeating isis in iraq and beyond in our view without the answers to these questions it makes no sense to proceed it is our job to review and assess i
