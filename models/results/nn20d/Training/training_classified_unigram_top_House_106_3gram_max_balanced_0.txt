airport which is badly needed people often say well tell us why a third airport is needed for the city of chicago so i would like to list three reasons one of course is as we know air travel is growing air travel is expected to triple in the next 25 years triple to the point where we will have 90 million passengers travel through the chicago metropolitan area ohare and midway will only be able to accommodate 60 million clearly if we are going to accommodate that growth in air travel the tripling of air travel we must expand our capacity the only way to expand our capacity is a south suburban third airport the second reason in a metropolitan area of 7 million people in the chicago metropolitan area there are 2 million who reside within a 45minute radius of the proposed site near peotone university park which is located in the district that i represent the chicago south suburbs a population of 2 million people justifies an airport in baltimore or st louis third when we think about the old adage that when we improve transportation we create jobs we have to be honest and that does give us the opportunity to bring a quarter million new jobs to the chicago metropolitan area we can use them on the chicago south side the south suburbs a south suburban third airport has bipartisan support i am pleased that we have the support in leadership from our new governor george ryan our new senator peter fitzgerald as well as bipartisan support within the house delegation from illinois from the gentlemen from illinois and myself it is that kind of bipartisan support that has made this a good project that is important to aviation as well as the chicago area i would also like to note that this past week the illinois state legislature as well as the governor approved 75 million by the state of illinois to begin purchasing land and begin the process of moving forward on a aouth suburban third airport and that was the key part of g6vernor ryans illinois first project proposal which was signed into law last week this amendment is important because what it does is provides a revenue string to match what the state is already doing to move forward with the south suburban third airport i ask for bipartisan support"], [2.8431415557861328e-05, 0.5000284314155579, 0, "i thank the gentleman the chairman of our committee and the dean of our delegation from arizona for yielding

h r 2116 the bipartisan veterans millenium health care act veterans benefits are truly earned opportunities i am very pleased we are able to approach this new century with comprehensive new legislation this bill makes a number of needed improvements to programs serving veterans two of which i would like to briefly highlight as the gentleman from arizona chairman stump indicated the bill would authorize the american battle monuments commission to begin construction of the world war ii monument here in the district of columbia the world war h generation as nbc nightly news managing editor and anchor tom brokaw has written is in fact the greatest generation what greater gift can one generation in this case our world war ii generation give to the generations that follow than freedom and what more enduring thanks can america give our world war ii veterans than to build their memorial and build it now h r 2116 also aggressively authorizes appropriations to the department of labor for the homeless veterans reintegration program as we approach a new century on any given evening it is estimated that more than 275 000 veterans the equivalent of 17 infantry divisions will sleep in doorways in boxes and on grates in our cities and in barns in leantos and on the ground in our towns our millenium bill aims to help many of these men and women find jobs by authorizing a 4year increase in labor department funding for this competitivelybid nationwide communitybased employment program i know of no group that wants to break the cycle of homelessness more than americas sons and daughters who have worn the uniform of this country finally i would note that despite the strong efforts of the gentleman from arizona chairman stump the ranking member the gentleman from illinois and the efforts of our own subcommittee chaired by the gentleman from new york the house version for the current g i bill and the role it hopefully will play in resolving veterans transition and military recruitment issues in the next century is not part of this legislation but it will be a top subcommittee prioritynext year h r 2116 is the result of bipartisan hard work for which i thank the members on both sides of the aisle and specifically the members of our subcommittee on benefits i urge my colleagues to support this millenium bill because it accords veterans opportunities that they have earned nothing more and nothing less i thank the chairman of the full committee for his longstanding leadership on behalf of our nations veterans and i thank the ranking minority member for his continued commitment and support as well in closing i would celebrate the bipartisan nature of this bill and join with the gentleman from arizona chairman stump and the ranking member the

general debate but i wanteai to voice my concerns about the general policy path that this measure puts in place i think what we really need here is sort of a reality check in terms of what is going down with this bill i have no objections to the rule i think it is a fair rule which permits amendments but i do not think that this bill is going to be corrected by amendment the underlying premise of the bill fundamentally is sound i think that many of us could agree with such policy as counties and school districts that are dependent upon the 25 percent of total fund yielded from resource extraction in the national forests to support their basic governing structure to support their schools such funds have become limited and cut back because of the reality of forest science and policies that have curtailed the harvest of timber and other activities most importantly i think here is the realization of new forestry and what is sustainable and what is not and what the impacts are and how those multiple uses of our national forests have come to conflict with one another so obviously in the last decade in terms of forest science timber harvest has been limited so the reduction in dollars is significant to these communities i think i would stand with my colleagues to try and maintain some stable funding this bill obviously does maintain stable funding by giving them the highest amount their average for the highest 3year period in terms of funding for their counties and their schools from 1985 while there are a lot of other programs around in terms of impact aid for military and other issues i think we have tried to recognize nationally where we have significant lands like through the pilt program payment in lieu of taxes program and other programs some funding for communities where we have significant public ownership federal ownership of lands and where that does impact we have provided assistance in trying to stabilize that in this case is a good thing to do at the same time in terms of extending and authorizing the significant amounts of money in this bill congress should also try and delink and reform the system to a greater extent that means to try and establish once and for all that these communities should not be receiving the dollars based wholly on timber production that we should delink that as we stabilize and assure stable funding while there is a token attempt to do that in this bill it totally fails in the final analysis to do that to delink timber receipts from state local funding furthermore one of the problems with this bill is that it provides for communities that do receive over 100 000 and in many other instances where they receive significant aid under this measure to in fact establish dozens of different advisory committees which would then sit down and decide how in a local area and make recommendations to the secretary of agriculture or interior on how to expend 20 percent of the resources that they are provided under this bills authority i know the counties and school districts would just as well receive the money themselves this sets up a big problemin fact a grant program under cover of this measure first of all it creates a lot more government than probably anyone need we already have county boards and school boards that could make decisions on how to expend this money frankly i think these advisory groups set up the potential and set up the secretary of agriculture and the chief of the forest service for a lot more controversy and conflict frankly it is going to be up to the secretary of agriculture and the chief of the forest service to make decisions to say no to a lot of local advisory groups in a very unpleasant way delivering the bad news that some of these proposals are not worthy it is up to the secretary with such little details as requiring whether or not an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment is needed and if it is needed then the cost will go back to the local group to pay for writing thats another unpopular decision to say the least i just think it is going to create a lot more conflict i do not see this as being helpful i think that it is a step in the wrong direction creating all this governing structure is not an improvement it is not what america is demanding with regards to deal with this problem quite the contrary i think it expands the original problem creating controversy and confusing the topici have questions about whether all federal laws are going to be complied with such as enforcing the prevailing wage law i have questions about the use of individuals in this that are put into a situation where they are forced to work in the county because they are under mandatory worktype requirements both adults and juveniles that provision is in the bill there are a lot of concerns that i have but fundamentally i think the bill fails on the basis of not delinking the roller coaster ride of upanddown timber revenues sharing that occur as the local receipts from our national forests to these local communities in other words it keeps that link in place it creates all this governing structure and i think it is going to create more conflict this is not an interim bill it lasts for 7 or 8 years the description of this as an interim bill is flawed on its surface and misleading i urge the defeat of this measure"],

ought to be able to agree on it is not a bill about controlling guns in this country and the broad sense of that debate it is a fact that i happen to believe in the second amendment and the right to bear arms selfdefense and so forth but i am concerned and that is why this amendment is here with the fact that we have laws rightfully on the books that everybody in this country agrees with and that is laws that say that felons convicted felons should not be allowed to get guns we have a problem with the fact that some kids are getting killed on our streets all too many of them with violent youth crime one of the principal reasons why that is occurring is because there is a loophole in the current instant check laws i do not favor waiting periods and we are not talking about that tonight we are talking about how can we at a balanced approach which this underlying bill h r 2122 does how can we close a loophole in the existing law that does require when one goes to buy a gun that there is a background check an instantkneous background check in the best sense that we can do that a name check to find out if one is indeed a criminal with a felony record and therefore disqualified to buy that gun that is all this is about tonight i think the underlying bill is very responsible people have criticized various things about it and misstated i think unintentionally i am sure some things about it the truth is that yeah maybe 25 percent of the people who go to buy a gun when they do go through an instant check whether it is at a gun show or otherwise are flagged but 80 percent of those people who are flagged are not criminals they wind up getting those guns a very tiny fraction are screened out when they are they should be though the idea is to close a loophole in the gun show which up until now if one is not a registered dealer and one sells a gun to somebody at a gun show one does not have this instant check the underlying bill that i support strongly requires the instant check for everyone who purchases a gun at a gun show just like everyone who purchases a gun from a gun dealer anywhere else it should not be a problem it should not be a difficult vote it is one that a lot

have to invest some general fund money where are you going to find the general fund money over time by drawing down that debt you free up interest payments that we are now having to make you have got
