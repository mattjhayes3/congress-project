two steps the first is to 5 65 an hour beginning april 1 2000 and the second is to 6 15 an hour beginning let me put it in simple terms a 1 increase in the minimum wage is enough for a family of four to buy groceries for 7 months or pay rent for 5 months now one of my colleagues said we are trying to promote prosperity and happiness i can tell my colleagues that we are not trying to promote prosperity but for sure coming from a poor family i can say that when there is a little more on the table or the landlord is not knocking at the door for the rent yes it brings a lot of happiness now i would have preferred that we were debating a clean minimumwage bill one free bf specialinterest exemptions but reality dictates otherwise american men and women cannot and should not have to wait any longer for congress to provide them with a living wage this increase is long overdue it is unacceptable to delay the american worker this pay raise even one additional year a 3year increase as proposed by the bill would cost a fulltime yearround worker more than 900 over 2 years now 900 may not sound like a lot of money to members of congress but to millions of americans who make a minimum wage it can sometimes make the difference in raising them above the poverty level america has achieved the longest period of economic growth in our entire history it is time with the lowest

both the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities have launched major new initiatives to reach out to more americans the endowment has been criticized for not

providing services or awarding financial assistance to populations historically underserved by the national endowment for the arts by increasing the funding for the national endowment for the arts we can help ensure a nationwide access to the arts an education through the arts improves a students overall ability to learn it instills selfesteem and discipline and provides creative outlets for self

committee on international relations the gentleman from new york i of course would also like to thank the ranking democrat on the committee the gentleman from connecticut for his sustained interest in and support for this legislation the reason that we are here today is that north koreas record on nuclear and ballistic missile proliferation is nothing short of abysmal this secretive stalinist rogue regime has over the last decade refused to carry out its obligations under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and other accords it has signed in fact in 1993 north korea threatened to withdraw from the npt and stopped international inspections of its nuclear weapons programs it has constructed nuclear reactors and a plutonium reprocessing plant at a site called yongbyon as a result of these activities unitedstates and foreign intelligence assessments have reportedly concluded that north korea probably has acquired enough weaponsgrade plutonium to manufacture from one to three nuclear bombs at the same time north korea has been testing and developing ballistic missiles that may soon be capable of reaching as far away as the western united states in addition north korea is believed to be a major exporter of ballistic missile technology and components to countries like iran and pakistan increasing the security risk in those regions of the world in an effort to halt north koreas progress towards a fullblown nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capacity the clinton administration negotiated an agreed framework with north korea in 1994 which provided a package of benefits in return for a freeze on north koreas nuclear program and acceptance of nonproliferation requirement one key component of this benefits package was a united states promise to facilitate the delivery of two lightwater nuclear reactors to north korea which were intended to replace two nuclear weapons production reactors then under construction in north korea h r 4251 would require an affirmative vote of approval before any nuclear cooperation agreement between the united states and north korea that allows the sale of these reactors to go forward this amendment builds on an effort begun last year by the gentleman from new york and myself last july 21 the house voted 305 to 120 to pass the gilmanmarkey amendment to the state department authorization bill which required the president to make certain nonproliferation certifications regarding north koreas compliance with various international agreements regarding nuclear nonproliferation that is the npt and the 1994 agreed framework and the congress to pass a joint resolution approving an agreement for cooperation with north korea before unitedstates nuclear facilities technologies or materials can be exported to north korea the specific certifications required under the gilmanmarkey amendment were drawn from the terms of the 1994 agreed framework all our amendment required is for the president to certify that the north koreans have actually complied with the specific nuclear nonproliferation commitments they made under the agreed framework and other international agreements they have signed to terminate their efforts to enrich uranium reprocess spent fuel or otherwise acquire test or deploy nuclear weapons now there was one part of the gilmanmarkey amendment as it passed the house that the senate was not willing to accept that was the requirement for an affirmative vote of approval by the congress before a nuclear cooperation agreement could become effective for north korea under current law nuclear cooperation agreements take effect within 90 days of their formal submission by the president unless congress has within that time period passed a joint resolution of disapproval while this process theoretically provides an opportunity to review and block a nuclear cooperation agreement in practice the congress has never in its history passed a joint resolution disapproving a nuclear cooperation agreement that is never my colleagues never indeed most of the time congress never even votes on these agreements as the state department the unitedstates nuclear industry and their supporters can usually run out the clock and thereby allow an agreement to take effect without any congressional vote even though there are nonproliferation considerations that should have been debated on the floor of congress h r 4251 assures that congress will have a strong voice in ensuring that any future unitedstates north korea nuclear cooperation agreement is fully consistent with our national security and nuclear nonproliferation interests it does so by requiring a joint resolution of approval to be adopted by the congress before any such agreement goes into effect i am pleased that the bill also included expedited procedures to assure timely congressional action on any approval resolution brought forth in the future with respect to north korea the gentlewoman from connecticut had raised the issue of possible delaying tactics particularly in the senate during last years debate over this provision by providing expedited procedures for consideration of an approval resolution we should help assure that a vote actually occurs on any north korea nuclear cooperation agreement i think this is a good bill i think the gentleman from new york has provided enormously important national leadership on this question without question it has now arisen to the top of our national security concerns of our nation and i hope this resolution receives unanimous support here today"], [8.0108642578125e-05,

that is attached costs the american taxpayer 66 million a year this is money that could go to education to our schools we just had a bill on the floor where people talked about the need for more money for education this is where we could save some money where we could save some money by doing what is right i would just like to say that what basically has happened is for decades the oil companies have underpaid the government for oil extracted from federally owned lands they got caught by the department of justice by the department of interior and i would say by the subcommittee on government management information and technology headed by the gentleman from california who held many hearings on the underpayment of oil royalties the royalty holiday of the oil companies stealing money from the american taxpayer they had to pay 5 billion in penalties for what they ripped off in the past so what we have before us is a number of antienvironmental riders that are terribly unacceptable i must say that the gentleman from washington who is the ranking member and the gentleman from ohio did a wonderful job keeping them off of the house version but we need to keep them off the conference report too so i hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will join us in voting against this rule against the unacceptable oil riders and other riders that hurt the environment that steal money from the taxpayers that could be going to education it is just a bad bill we need to stand up for americas schools for the american taxpayers and stand up against the antienvironmental ripoff

paying american schoolteachers and the government for federally owned land they underpay to the tune of 66 million a year it is wrong it is terribly wrong if my colleagues are fiscally conservative vote against this bill just on the oil rider alone mr speaker i rise in strong opposition to this conference report because it contains an unacceptable rider that will let big oil companies continue to steal money from our nations schoolchildren to fatten their own wallets mr speaker these oil companies have been caught cheating on the royalty payments they owe for drilling oil on federal land royalty payments that benefit our schools our environment and the american taxpayer as a result they have to pay almost five billion dollars in settlements but now every time that the interior department has tried to fix the rules so that they pay the money they owe the supporters of big oil have come to this congress and blocked them from doing it this time they were a little more creative they decided to delay the rules until the general accounting office can audit interiors rulemaking process but we all know that this is just another delay designed to get us to the next mustpass

is cut or corn is cut this is a foolish policy we say that if one is a school in a national forest county that they have to be in favor of cutting as much timber as they possibly can in publiclyowned
