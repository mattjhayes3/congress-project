to express my wholehearted support for the adoption of house joint reso lution 220 proclaiming raoul wallenberg to be an honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of

contained in section 2415 of title 28 of the united states code under that section the united states has the right and duty to bring suits for money damages against third parties on behalf of indian tribes and individuals for claims arising out of contracts or torts the kinds of claims involved include infringement of indian water rights degradation of fishing rights and a variety of nonpublic trespasses the law requires that the united states bring these socalled 2 415 claims by december 31 of this year house joint resolution 553 was introduced in part because of concern that the departments of justice and interior will not have fulfilled their responsibilities with respect to these claims by the time the statute expires on september 23 the interior committee held a hearing on the resolution and on the departments efforts with respect to the claims i can say that the testimony established a clear need for action to insure that the united states fulfills its legal obligations to indians and protects the federal treasury from unnecessary liability the record shows that when congress in 1966 enacted the 6year statute of limitations for the united states to bring contract or tort claims against american citizens it did so without any intent to affect the unitedstates obligation to bring such claims on behalf of indians when it became apparent that the united states faced potentially huge liability for breach of trust if it failed to act on the indian claims congress extended the statute to give the departments of the interior and justice time to identify research evaluate and file any such valid claims in the language of the last extension congress also included a requirement that the departments submit by june 1981 legislation to resolve those claims not well suited to resolution by litigation over the past 10 years and at a cost of over 20 million the departments have identified over 17 000 legally valid claims however the department of justice has determined that less than 1 000 of these claims are candidates for litigation that several thousand should not be litigated and that several thousand others should be resolved by legislation despite having identified a number of claims as condidates for legislative solution the departments did not submit any legislation to congress until just this past month much too late for proper consideration and passage moreover the legisltion submitted deals only with a fraction of those claims which the departments indicated would most appropriately be resolved by legislation as reported by the interior committee house joint resolution 553 would provide a mechansim for resolving these indian damage claims with finality and in a manner that is fair to the claimants in short the legislation provides that a list of all identified claims with arguable legal merit be compiled within 360 days any and all claims not listed would be forever barred the listed claims would be dealt with in the following manner for those claims the departments determine should be resolved by legislation the statute of limitations would run 3 years from the date legislation is submitted to congress for those claims the departments determine should be neither legislated nor litigated the statute would run 1 year from the date that notice is provided to the tribes or individuals advising them of the departments decisions and the reasons for them the remaining claims would be litigated house joint resolution 553 should be enacted for a variety of reasons among them the following first it precludes the need for the filing before december 31 of hundreds of protective lawsuits this means that thousands of potential defendants will be spared being joined in litigation which otherwise might be avoided by negotiation or legislation second house joint resolution 553 insures that potential indian claimants are provided due process in particular it would insure that indians receive more than just a few weeks notice from their trustee of the trustees decision not to bring litigation on their behalf after years of consideration of these cases the departments have recently been publishing notices of potential actions in newspapers this gives the indians little time to learn more about their potential claims and whether they want to pursue them on their own simple fairness mandates an extension in these cases third house joint resolution 553 insures that congress will have sufficient time to consider legislative solutions to claims which the departments believe can best be resolved by legislation fouth and perhaps most important to those of us concerned about federal deficits house joint resolution 553 reduces the prospect of substantial liability to the unitedstates treasury as a result of successful breach of trust suits brought psinst the united states for failure to pursue identified claims such liability has been repeatedly cited in the past as reason for extending the statute it is still an excellent reason for doing so i am pleased to state that the administration does not oppose enactment of this legislation that it is considered workable and all things considered desirable for the record i recognize that some within the administration disagree with language in the committees report concerning decisions respecting these indian claims and the
