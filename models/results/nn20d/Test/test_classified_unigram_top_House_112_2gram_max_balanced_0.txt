about seeing four young men that have no body parts below their waist theyre living they would have died in vietnam medical technology has advanced to the point that a young man or young woman can

to me that to pick the one fund that deals with prevention is really the worst thing you could have done today because what were trying to do with the affordable care actand what ive sought to do in everything that weve done in the subcommittee since ive been on itis to really stress prevention because we can avoid people going to hospitals we can avoid people going to nursing homes they can lead a better quality of life and we save money so i just think it is really unfortunate today that after so many years of a bipartisan effort to deal with prevention to fund prevention issues that this is the one fund thats actually picked on today to come to the floor i think its really a horrible thing that that is the case so i would urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution because if you

important to many americans a topic that relates to an important anniversary we are recognizing today we are highlighting the third anniversary of president obamas failed stimulus package the president promised 3 years ago that the stimulus would create what he characterized as millions of jobs but today unfortunately devastatingly there are nearly 13 million people in america who are still unemployed and many millions more have even given up on looking for jobs three years ago the white house said that because of the stimulus package unemployment would not exceed 8 percent that has not happened in fact the unemployment rate has topped 8 percent for 36 straight months nowthe longest stretch of high unemployment since the great depression the congressional budget office predicts it is going to go even longer we will not see sub8 percent unemployment according to the cbo until 2014 the president sold his stimulus package to the american people by claiming he would make immediate investments in what he characterized as shovelready jobs but last june the president acknowledged that shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected nevertheless a lot of money has been spent as we have been waiting for these jobs to materializejobs that never quite came about in fact some of it was spent in ways that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy for example consider some of the ways in which this stimulus money has been spent mr president 760 000 was spent on interactive dance software 1 2 million was spent on a train museum 2 million was spent to study ant behavior 762 000 was spent to study improvised musici am not sure what that is but i am sure it is lovely not necessarily deserving of scarce federal resources 300 000 to track weather on other

000 to develop a machinegenerated humor systemin other words a joke machine this big joke is on the american taxpayer unfortunately it is no laughing matter in the last 3 years we have added more than 4 trillion to the national debt we have recorded the three largest annual deficits in our nations history and we are on pace for a fourth straight deficit exceeding 1 trillion this week the president submitted a budget that calls for adding 11 trillion in new debt over the next decade his own treasury secretary calls the level of spending unsustainable and it is despite the overwhelming evidence that his stimulus package has failed the president has called for additional increases in spending i know the president is a good man i also know he faced a difficult economy when he took office but the president is unwilling to tell the truth to the american people about what lies ahead about some of the challenges we face i think he needs to do so and he needs to acknowledge the fact that this stimulus package has failed so we can avoid making similar mistakes in the future today we cannot celebrate the anniversary of the presidents stimulus rather we must lament a tremendous lost
