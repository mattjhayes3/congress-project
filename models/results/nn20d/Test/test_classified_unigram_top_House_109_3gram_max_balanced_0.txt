again and again and again and again the american people want and deserve a clean upordown vote on raising the minimum wage and this rule does not provide for such a vote minimumwage workers want and deserve a clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that today so i urge my colleagues to reject this rule i reserve the balance of my time"],

committee comes out of an important hearing on the dubai ports issue he will be able to join us as well the 2007 budget takes america down a wrong and unsustainable path the decisions the president made in this budget favor the wealthy over the working class these decisions reward those who live off what th6 irs considers to be unearned income while making those who have to work long hours every day to support themselves and their families pay far more in taxes in fact i think you would have found bipartisan agreement if we could have worked out tax cuts that were more in the interest of the working class and those hardworking families but in fact when you combine the focug of the tax cuts on those who live primarily off unearned income and the spending cuts that purportedly are necessary to offset the cost of these tax cuts the majority of young people in this country will find it harder to go to college it will be harder for lowincome elderly to get the nutrition and health care they need and it will be much harder for our grandchildren to pay for the future needs that their generation will face the decisions made in the presidents 2007 budget like his budgets since 2002 define a nation a community if you will that is not the america that we know in fact his priorities are just the opposite of what makes america great we heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle they call it a socalled republican truth squad it boggles your mind but the fact is that the bush administration has raised spending while they have cut taxes you cant fight two wars on four tax cuts ladies and gentlemen the gentlewoman from north carolina suggested that the government never invests it only spends well what does she think is the purpose of the interstate highway system that enabled our economy to fulfill its potential during the eisenhower administration and subsequent administrations or the money that we have put into the public schools systems to empower our working class and that is what we are talking about investment that will give us sustainable benefits versus tax cuts that are immediately lost most of which seem to be invested overseas and cuts in the real safety net that can make america achieve its greatness the conscious choices made in this budget reflect the flawed policies of an administration that has taken this country down a terribly wrong path one that consists of waging an unnecessary and extraordinarily costly war delivering huge tax cuts to the very wealthiest of this nation and taking the federal debt to depths never before experienced while reducing services to working americans first the 2007 budget is heavily impacted by the consequences of a reckless foreign venture namely the war in iraq the presidents 2007 budget sets aside another 120 billion supplemental to cover the cost of waging this war in fiscal 2007 of course this is on top of a regular defense budget of over 450 billion and in fact we have now allotted over 400 billion when you look through fiscal 2007 primarily for this war in iraq and very little for the war in afghanistan that was referred to by our colleague from maryland the money that is requested in these iraq war supplementals is 40 billion more than we request for transportation 33 billion more than we request for education and training more than 40 billion more than we request for the care of our military veterans inbre than 90 billion more than we will set aside to protect our environment and natural resources and more than 80 billion for what is considered diplomacy but is spent on dealing with the aids crisis on dealing with the ethnic cleansing the genocide in sudan and throughout the world places where we could have such a constructive positive effect the arhount of money that is being requested in fiscal 2007 for this war iii iraq will bring the total amount requested by the bush administration to 490 billion an enormous sum the american people have to ask has this been worth it given the results to date but we know the results are more than 2 300 americans who have lost their lives in iraq more than 16 700 who have been wounded tens if not hundreds of thousands of iraqi casualties andyet osama bin laden is still on the run iraq now appears to be descending into an allout civil war and al qaeda recruitment levels are reportedly stronger than ever but while our men and women are risking their lives overseas at the instruction of this administration and of course we have great regard for their courage and sacrifice we are not being asked to sacrifice at home and in fact the people who have been the most rewarded by this great economythat was built on the investments that have been made in prior generationsthey are being asked to sacrifice the least in fact they are actually being rewarded the same time that these men and women are going to war we are continuing trillions of dollars of tax cuts that primarily benefit the very wealthiest in our society and yet these tax proposals are going to cost the american people about 3 trillion 3 trillion over the next decade the benefits from these tax cuts are heavily skewed toward the wealthy if they were to fix the alternative minimum tax for the middle class that would be one thing if they were to help workingclass families deal with the vulnerabilities they face in providing for their families that would be one thing but that is not where most of it goes more than half of these benefits go to the 4 percent of americans who make over 200 000 annually four years from now in 2010 taxpayers with incomes of more than 1 million a year will receive average tax cuts worth 155 000 100 times the tax cut that the average taxpayer will receive is that fair is that smart i dont think it is appropriate and i dont think it reflects americas priorities and they come at a huge cost to the fiscal security of this nation causing massive amounts of annual federal deficits over the last 4 years we have seen the largest deficits in the history of our nation mr scott is going to show you what has happened over the last 5 years on a chart i hope you will pay close attention it is unbelievable the current fiscal year 2006 is expected to produce the largest deficit ever in the history of our country at 423 billion and this doesnt even take into account the supplemental spending requests that the president will send up to the hill any day now which will increase the 2006 deficit to well over half a trillion dollars and fiscal 2007 will be another year of historic deficits predicted to be 354 billion in fact since president bush took office we have had the largest annual deficits in the history of this country and those numbers are net numbers after you take the social security surplus and offset it against general fund deficits so you can add another 200 billion annually to each of those numbers so we are creating debt of over 500 billion a year these deficits and the 8 trillion in debt we now have as a result of prior deficits will place on our children anti grandchildren an unprecedented level of debt burden because of these policies every child born today automatically inherits 28 000 as their share of the federal debt and under the presidents budget proposals a child born just 5 years from now will inherit a much larger share in fact they will be paying taxes for nearly the first 5 months of every year just to pay the interest on the debt that their parents generation incurred the presidents massive budget deficits also require us to borrow from foreign governments foreign investors now hold half of the countrys publicly held debt china alone holds 250 billion of the public debt which is more than 300 percent the amount that chinaheld only 5 years ago they have a fiscal guillotine over our necks if they chose to use it we are so dependent upon chinas being willing to borrow all this debt that we generate year after year let me just show you a chart in fact of this foreign debt mr kahn our very able staff director on the house budget committee has put this together this is the aggregate unitedstates national debt held by foreign countries now the debt was climbing during the reagan years in the 1980s continued to climb during the bush years during the beginning of the clinton years it started to top oft and then with president clinton having adopted the payasyougo policy of the first president bush having to pay for tax cuts as well as additional spending we got the budget under control we had an estimated 5 6 trillion surplus predicted for the succeeding decade go foreign debt would have gone down just like this and as our foreign debt went down our national security would have gone up but this administration decided they did not want to adopt the policies of the father they did not want any payasyougo they just wanted to cut taxes the heck with paying it we will send a credit card to the next generation they can pay off our debt that is their problem not ours we are going to live high off the hog we are going to reward our contributors and the fact is that that is exactly what has happened and we have driven this nation into debt but even more seriously look at what has happened to foreign debt foreign debt has gone up like this to here we are now at 1 5 trillion here we are at 1 175 trillion and here we are over 2 trillion in 2005 a substantial share being purchased by china as i just said a 300 percent increase in chinas share of the foreign debt but imagine what has happened to foreign debt since 2001 when this president took office talk about endangering national security now who pays for all of this well what happens is that the american people obviously pay our children will pay most of it but even today the sick and the elderly who need care that cannot be provided by their families will pay we will have our college students pay in reductions in student loans and basically the dignity and the upward mobility of the american working class is going to suffer for these policies this is a situation that is not sustainable that has to be reversed now everyone is entitled to their own ideological opinions i do not think they ought to be entitled to their own set of facts this is factual information you can check in any of these budget documents put out by the government you can find that the amount of debt has skyrocketed the amount of debt held by foreign nations has skyrocketed to an even greater degree we are dependent on countries like china to keep us afloat and in fact the working class has suffered our children are going to pay the bill and we are involved in a war that we are only paying for by borrowing from the future we have not paid one dime of the cost of the iraq war nor have we paid for the tax cuts that we have so blithely passed with this i would like to yield to mr scott who has been on the budget committee for several years and he is going to show you some shocking charts as well"], [0.13239741325378418, 0.8676025867462158, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time as a member of the joint economic committee i rise today to speak on the economic policies of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.13239753246307373, 0.8676024675369263, 1, "this congress is

majority they are being very irresponsible and to say that that is fine we will give you what you want of course i think we are going to see more of that kind of action by the republican majority to say that oh we are with you even if we are running the country into the ground we know better we know that we have foreign countries that we are borrowing from because we cant even borrow from ourselves anymore because we have done such a bad job we know we have raised the debt ceiling time after time after time again meanwhile we come to the floor and say our policies are working we know that there are things we should not be doing because you are working every day or you are running your business eyery day you may not be paying attention to everything that is going on not only are we elected but we are paid to watch out for your best interest and also for future generations best interests and they are doing it and i think that the paradigm shift as it relates to the american people paying attention to what they are doing in a way from a fiscal way i think will take place between now and november and so what is so unfortunate abqut this whole situation is that we are supposed to be responsible policymakers on a bipartisan basis and that is not happening right now that is just not happening the american taxpayers are getting mugged knocked down and kicked by this republican majority and the rubber stamp or the rubberstamp congress republican majority that is here now one other thing i want to mention here which i think is very very important just today mr ryan mrs tubbs jones we dont have to go back to weeks or months or 2 years ago or 3 years ago we had a payasyougo provision here individuals decided not to take it up we had an opportunity to raise the minimum wage on behalf of the american taxpayers the republican majority rejected an opportunity to raise the minimum wage for everyday working americans as a matter of fact mr ryan one of the republican leaders said i havent voted in 25 years to raise the minimum wage and if he would have had his way the minimum wage would still be 3 35 versus 5 15 i am so glad that my state joined 21 other states in raising the minimum wage meanwhile we are still here with chisel and hammer in hand as neanderthals on the republican side of the ball and saying oh we dont have to raise the minimum wage we are so indebted to the special interests that we dont even want to bother them of having an american public that is able to pay the rent or pay for their house mortgage or to be able to put gas in their tank we are so invested in the k street project we are so invested in so many other things that we are willing to allow these individuals to suffer but guess what those are the same individuals that are making america america and there are millions of americans that are there and so what is very very unfortunate here is the fact that the republican majority is still boasting about you know we are in charge we are going to continue to keep our foot on the necks of everyday americans that are going in punching in and punching out every day 5 days a week sometimes 6 because they have to work overtime those americans that know what it means to take a 15minute break in the morning and a 15minute break in the afternoon and a solid 30 minutes of lunch if they get that and they better not be a minute late those kind of individuals i think are going to go to the polls this november and say no more they are going to go to the polls and say we are willing to fight for the kind of accountability that we need from this government i am so proud of the 30something working group and the members that come down here and the democratic members that file legislation on behalf of the american people not on behalf of the democratic party not even on behalf of the democratic caucus not on behalf of our leadership but on behalf of the individuals that they represent who woke up early one tuesday morning and voted for representation in this unitedstates house of representatives and i must add the only chamber that you have to be elected to that you cant be appointed to al due respect to the senate but senators can be appointed by governors if a senator was to say hey you know i have had enough i want to go home i want to take care of my grandkids a governor can appoint a senator but in democracy in this chamber in the unitedstates house if one member were to say hey i want to take care of my grandkids i want to spend more time with my kids they have to run for office they have to run for office and they have to be replaced by the people so we have a greater responsibility we have a greater responsibility than the white house than the senate or the supreme court when you look at the three branches government to the american people the oversight house resolution 841 and mr cardozas legislation that calls for the calling in those administrators that are not accountable to taxpayers dollars these are the kind of bills that we must pass one thing i can say mr ryan which is so very important on our side of the ball of saying we want to take this country in a new direction is the fact that we said we will increase the minimum wage we will make our country more energyindependent within 10 years we will implement the 9 11 recommendations to be able to

twohundredandtwentysome billion dollars out of this budget now when you look and you compare what we have to pay in interest on the debt compared to what we are paying for education or homeland security or veterans it is totally and utterly disproportionate to the kind of investments we need to be making because this money and on the chart here we are borrowing this money from the japanese government we are borrowing the money from the chinese government we are borrowing the money from opec countries we are ceding our country away to these other foreign interests and at the same time we are asking japan and cliina to borrow money because we do not have enough because we are giving out corporate subsidies to the oil companies and corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical companies while we are doing that we have to go and borrow the money from the chinese government and then we have to borrow it from the opec countries and as we showed before earlier an hour or so ago the chinese government is taking this money they are lending it to us collecting the interest and investing that money in the training of engineers to the tune of 600 000 engineers that they are going to train next year while we are training 70 that really is the bottom line that these kind of decisions are leading and costing they are leading to enormous problems for our country and they are costing us a lot of money they are really beginning i think to push the burden down on to the next generation we cannot continue to sustain the kind of deficits that we are running the next year or 2007 years

of 50 60 70 billion to the health care industry in subsidies it is a coincidence or maybe it is not that the oil industrys profits are going through the roof so it begs the question why are we subsidizing them the energy companies profits going up subsidizing them too pharmaceutical companies profits through the roof subsidize them too this is paytoplay in washington d c and all the while it is happening at the expense of average people all this is happening at the cost of the american people there is a corruption tax there is a k street tax to average people who are trying to do

has served on the ethics committee for 7 years at a time when we worked in a bipartisan fashion to maintain a high ethical standard i take very seriously our responsibility to the american people to do their business here not the business of the special interests of the lobbyists that is why it is such a pity that we really dont have transparency in this rule and in this bill where we can come to the floor with an open rule where all points of view can be considered and all positive initiatives can be considered and voted up or down lets leave that up to the debate we certainly can do better than this that wouldnt be difficult democrats are offering a motion to recommit that breaks the link between k street lobbyists and the congress of the united states it says it bans it is unequivocal it is unambiguous it bans gifts and travel from lobbyists and from organizations who employ lobbyists it prohibits use of corporate jets for official travel it just prohibits it you cant do it it shuts down the k street project in which lobbying firm jobs are traded for legislative favors and it shuts down the revolving door what a disgrace this revolving door that is spinning so fast it prohibits members senior staff and executive branch officials from lobbying their former colleagues for 2 years after leaving office two years i think it should be longer but that is a compromise today the republican majority brings forth a rule that is itself an abuse of power the republicanrules committee has refused to let this house debate bills that 165 democrats cosponsored the republicans have re fused to let this house debate even republican serious proposals directed at cronyism and corruption in government contracting the republicans have refused to let this house debate any serious attempt to end the culture of corruption they call this bill the lobbying accountability and transparency act the washington post calls it a joke the sad thing is it is not a very funny joke because once again the american people are paying the price my colleagues have listed some of the abuses of power mr waxman in particular talked about what the impact is on the american consumer from some of those abuses of power imagine that the person managing the bill on prescription drugs left this house and soon was representing the pharmaceutical industry for 2 million a year in salary how much does it cost to sell the seniors down the river well about 2 million a year if you are the manager of the prescription drug bill that is why americans middleincome seniors will be paying more at the pharmacy because of the corruption that was involved in writing this bill a bill where the pharmaceutical industry insisted that there be a prohibition in the bill against the secretary of hhs for negotiating for lower prices it was in the bill because the pharmaceutical industry insisted upon it they had their representatives at the table americas seniors did not who do you think came out on top in that bill writing we have talked about a time when the american taxpayer has the burden of that plus paying a price at the pump because of the corruption in writing the energy policy for this country behind closed doors refusing to reveal what went into writing that legislation 3 1645 and that legislation do not take it from me the republican department of energy stated at the time that the energy bill proposed and passed by the republicans in this congress would increase the price at the pump they said it at the time so not only are the consumers paying the price at the pump and an increased cost in their home heating oil and cooling oil as we go into the summer months they gave a gift they the american taxpayers we gave a gift to the oil companies that same bill that increased the price at the pump that people are now paying nearly 3 a gallon for they those oil companies those same oil companies got subsidies of 12 billion in the energy bill they got royalty relief royalty holidays of several more billion dollars and to make matters worse in the most recent tax bill that is being prepared to coine to this floor they will get 5 5 billion more in tax breaks what are they taking the american taxpayer for what are they thinking of it is such an insult to the intelligence of the consumer and the taxpayer wait a minute at a time of record of record profits historic and obscene profits these companies are paying enormous fees the ceo of exxon is getting a retirement package of 400 million record profits high subsidies from the taxpayer and high prices at the pump a very raw deal for the american consumer all of it born from the culture of corruption in this house of representatives we must break that link we are here for the interests of the american people for the public interest the republicans are here for the special interests they are the handmaidens of the pharmaceutical industry they are the handmaidens of the energy companies they do not know any other way to do it and that is why we get not only bad policy not only corruption in this house not only a cost of that corruption to the taxpayer and to the consumer but we have a ruse of a bill that tries to masquerade as reform on this house of representatives i feel really sad about this i feel sad for the american people they expect and deserve better and we can give that to them in our motion to recommit that i talked about earlier it bans the gifts and travel it breaks the link it stops the revolving door it also says that if you are convicted of a felony in the performance of your duties as a member of this house you do not get your pension you do not get your pension and as i said again this whole thing about jet travel and the rest our motion to recommit would prohibit corporate travel for official purposes so i hope that our colleagues will understand that we certainly can do better and that the american people are watching that we can present substantive reforms some that we should be debating today i can assure my colleagues that these reforms that if we have these reforms we will end this culture of corruption i also assure you that if the democrats win the congress next year they will be implemented on the first day the first day of the first session of this next congress so let us start fresh with this the american people as i say expect and deserve better we can clear the slate by rejecting allout rejecting this ruse this pathetic pathetic little tiny step that is a missed opportunity for a high ethical standard and is an excuse to keep the culture of corruption that is here i urge my colleagues to vote no on this rule and if the opportunity presents itself to support the democratic motion to recommit i want to in closing commend thb ranking democrat on the rules committee congresswoman slaughter she has been a relentless crusader for a high ethical standard in this house for not only lobby reform and all kinds of other reform but for injecting a level of civility into how we should have debate on the floor of the house that respects the views of democrats and republicans because we respect the people who sent all of us here not just having republicans heard and democrats blocked out so congresswoman slaughter i commend you for your leadership i thank you for your courage i urge our colleagues to vote no on the rule"],

the middle class and the working poor and the poor and the greatest deficit in the history of the united states that is the result of the priorities and policies of the republican majority that is a fact i believe they are the wrong priorities and they put us continuous on the wrong track but that will be up to the voters in november to change but what about the comments you hear about these tax cuts that are spurring the economy in unprecedented revenues hogwash hogwash the secretary of treasury john snow from the bush administration came before our committee this week and said secretary of the treasury under president bush said these tax cuts are responsible for onethird of this deficit they are responsible for onethird of this deficit the greatest deficit in the history of the united states that is what these tax cuts have caused he said by the way for every dollar in tax cuts we give we do not get back more money than we gave out in tax cuts we get 30 to 40 cents for every dollar in tax cuts which means we lose in the treasury 60 to 70 cents on every dollar we give out we only get back 30 to 40 cents well if we could afford that i suppose it would be great to give people back more money then the question is who should get the tax cuts people on the republican side of the aisle say boldly everybody should get a tax cut well i do not know about you but in a time of war in a time when we have natural disasters like hurricane rita and hurricane katrina when people are working harder and not making any more money they have growing health care bills and are worried about their retirement they are having their college tuition costs increased by the republican majority veterans are paying more than ever because the majority says they do not have the money they do not have the money they say even to inspect more than 5 percent of the containers coming into america then say we do not have the money hong kong inspects 100 percent of the containers what are they doing with the money they are giving it to the very richest people in the country and they say it boldly yes we are doing that everybody should have a tax cut well you know these same folks have been getting the benefit of trillions of dollars of tax cuts since president bush took office the recession has been over for 3 years do they still need the money when we have the biggest deficit in history and you tell veterans and college kids and seniors we do not have the money for your program or parents with kids who have disabilities we do not have money for your program they say well there they go again those democrats class warfare hogwash we have to make a decision about what to do with our tax dollars should we spend it on people who need it the middle class by getting rid of this alternative minimum tax the republican majority says no we do not have the money to get rid of the alternative minimum tax that affects primarily the middle class they say they do not have the money they did not put itjin the budget what they did put in their budget were huge tax cuts for people making over 500 000 1 million 10 million up to the sky fortyfive percent of the tax cuts under their bill here 45 percent of the revenues go to people with incomes of 1 million a year is that the country you want to live in where we allow the republican majority to give our money to the rich and tell everybody else go jump in the lake pull yourselves up by your boot straps but the rich should get the money there is a difference between the democratic party who says lets fix that

republican study committee i will say the republican conference i mean the bottom line is we would not have the philosophy of a few come to the floor pass the budget committee and possibly a threat for it to come to the floor by the end of the week if it was not for the help of the republican conference now they are our friends we are coffee together we ride the elevator together we walk down the hall together we talk about raising our children and all of the things that people do who work together we all work together but we have a difference in philosophy and priorities and i will tell my colleagues right now and i just want to make sure that members if you have a family member that is a veteran i want you to go grab them because i am about to say something i want to make sure that we understand that these cuts and we are talking about 60 million americans 60 million th are jon medicaid right now enrolled in medicaid 60 million americans not 60 million iraqis not 60 million somalians 60 million americans who pay their taxes every day that know what it means to punch in and punch out at work every day know what it means to have a 15minute lunch break or a break in the morning if they get it 15 minutes in the afternoon and a 30minute lunch break if they get it these are the people that we are talking about also children are enrolled in this too so it is very very important i am looking here at the families usa which is a voice for health care consumers i mean basically they are saying these cuts this proposal will force lowincome people to pay like you said higher premiums that they cannot afford and copayments so let us just call it what it is it looks good when you look at the numbers and oh these are the cuts that we are making but let us translate what those cuts mean it means that for the premiums and copayments that people are making under the medicaid plan now which is not the greatest because this republican congress has increased it time after time now we are about to do it again they are not going to be able to afford health care so we might as well say that we do not have it we have companies now that are telling people to go and enroll in medicaid because they we do not have a national health care plan they cannot participate in that program so when folks start talking about weaning people off let us talk about this i have also said we talk about the difference between democrats and republicans now here is one for the veterans that allowed us to be here under the lights in this chamber fought for this country still fighting for this country and also i want to call special attention to our members who come to the floor and give great floor speeches about how we love the troops well i have not seen a member come to the floor yet and say hey listen i do not like the troops so to say that i care about the troops we all care about the troops we all want to make sure the troops are okay but what happens when they come home what happens what happens when after the parade what happens what happens after they turn their uniform in what happens to those individuals let me tell you what is going to happen under this budget the bottom line is that the republican budget cuts that are being made in health care are 14 million below current service over the next 5 years now i am going to tell my colleagues something maybe i represent too many veterans maybe i have heard too many stories about when someone who wants to see an ophthalmologist or a podiatrist or some sort of specialty at the va and they have to wait 6 months for an appointment 6 months for an appointment and in rural areas 1 9 6 it is even worse there are areas where they have va facilities and clinics that are only open once or twice a month and under this budget with a straight face they are going to come to the floor and that is the reason why periodical after periodical is saying that it is hard for the republican conference to even vote for their own budget now folks come to the floor well we want our friends on the dertocratic side if they could support us yes we want to balance the budget but we do not want the veterans who have been waiting 6 months now to have to wait a year because the majority side has made a 5year cut of 14 billion that is not chicken feed that is a lot of money and then it goes further because facts hurt facts hurt reality hurts we are here to make sure that we give voice to those americans that sent us here some folks use it very loosely this is the peoples house well guess what we believe it wedo not use it as a punch line we are here because people have elected us furthermore it goes on to require the veterans affairs committee to make 798 million in additiqnal cuts over the next 5 years also it imposes new fees for veterans for health care by reducing veterans benefits such as disability payments pension benefits and educational benefits now let me tell my colleagues something like we say sometimes let us put the cookie on the bottom shelf the bottom line is that folks are sugarcoating a number we are making these cuts and we have to do this one says we have to do it on behalf of the katrina commission another person says well we want the katrina commission but because of hurricane katrina we have to respond to those individuals some say well we have to make sure that we reduce the national debt and that is the reason we are making these cuts and we all know that even in the senate there is a lot of chestbeating because there is a 6 billion tax break mainly for the top bracket and mainly for the special interests that they are going to push through this chamber why because if there is going to be a tax cut there should be a tax cut that is going to help every day americans but how can we with a straight face when we have veterans waiting 6 months for basic health care when we have folks in devastated areas with the three natural disasters that we have had that cannot even get a housing voucher that were made homeless because of the natural disaster when we have a government that is trying to figure out how we are going to continue to pay for the war in iraq how we are going to be able to pay for incompetence incompetence in the government how we are going to continue to condone cronyism a culture of cronyism at the same time the bottom line is ladies and gentlemen i believe the ma jority side really needs to have a meeting they need to have a meeting and talk about the true priorities of america and then one of those points in that meeting should be you know we really need to move in a bipartisan way oh wow that is a great idea hey let us work with the democrats and republicans and let us save the country now i am coming in f or a landing now i am going to tell you something people are saying why are you all on the floor every night why why are you on the floor every night some people are saying it is a great thing democrats and republicans we are glad the people are breaking this thing down so that we can all understand because we can use cbo and all the acronyms and folks can come to the floor and say we want to make america stronger what i am describing here is making a country weaker not because of the country and the people that live in it but the leadership that is supposed to govern it on behalf of making this country stronger these are the facts thirdparty validators these are the facts like it or not one other fact and ms wasserman schultz i am getting ready to yield to you i am going to take this chart out you know if i could mr ryan i would put this chart on the front of my truck so that people can see it if i had the resources i would get a billboard so that people understand what is going on this is not a woof speech this is a reality speech the bottom line is that the majority that is in control now need it be the house or senate or need it be the white iouse the policies that they are putting forth are not helping and strengthening our country period dot i do not want to make it seem like it is some sort of extreme statement it is not an extreme statement what i just described was happening to veterans the last 15 minutes we talked about what is happening to medicaid and medicare is on the table mr delahunt the bottom lineis 42 presidents 1776 we were not even thought of you know as members in this house here to the year 2000 42 presidents 1 01 trillion that we borrowed from foreign nations president bush not by himself with the republican majority not by himself i just want to make sure that everyone understands that the president does not have the ability to do this all by himself trust me 1 05 trillion from foreign nations mr ryan including china and so i think it is important that people understand this is not democratic talk this is not independent talk this is not even republican talk this is reality and unless we rise up i just want to make sure that we let the members know we know exactly on a majority side you can have a study group you can have a caucus within the caucus you can have subcommittees the bottom line is the policy will never see the light of day if it was not for the republican majority here in this house pushing it to the floor and that is the reason why that is the reason why you have republican conference members that have big problems they are you know they are even looking at their calendar saying well goodness it is my sons birthday on saturday maybe i can tell leadership we are going to celebrate it on thursday because i do not want to be here for this vote because how can i explain back home how we are increasing the wait list for veterans how we are cutting benefits for your children to go to college and we are going to put the responsibility on your back to take up the slack because we want to give tax cuts to special interests to billionaires i mean that is a hard thing to explain especially when you are by yourself back in your district and you are not hiding behind the press release from the majority office of this house of representatives and that ig the fact jack and the bottom line is we are going to man up and woman up and leader up and say no and that is the reason why it has not been to the floor and i hope that is the reason why it will not come to the floor in its present form and that we go into if we had rule xxi which we do have rule xxi here in the house but if we had a rule xxi like the senate we should go into closed session folks grab the mike the leadership and the bottom line is work out a plan that we can all work together take from the democratic budget the republican budget and do what americans want us to do they do not want us here talking about one another back and forth but the bottom line is that is the road map that has been laid out by the majority ms"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.8667315095663071, 0.13326849043369293, 1, "i ask

more drilling off the coast of florida california all around the coastline of our country he particularly focuses on natural gas and professes that natural gas is a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these people are goingto qualify for assistance i yield to the gentleman from florida"],

passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine that is moving in the right direction i believe that the tax relief package and the tax cuts that we passed are a large part ofthat"], [0.8496413975954056, 0.15035860240459442, 1,

"this month we witnessed the signing of the peace agreement in nairobi kenya between the government of sudan and the sudan peoples liberation army the signing of this agreement has ended africas longest running war a brutal civil war that spanned 21 years where 2 million people died i congratulate the parties for reaching this agreement i also want to commend president bush secretary of state powell and his team ambassador danforth and all the outside groups for their unrelenting efforts in the support of peace i also want to commend all the countries that played a critical role in the peace particularly norway and kenya now all parties have to live up to the agreement and begin the task of rebuilding the lives of millions of people this would be a good time for the administration to appoint a strong acting ambassador to immediately go to khartoum to help implement the peace agreement this would not be to reward khartoum but to keep pressure on all parties to make sure the agreement sticks and to speak out on the issue of darfur there is nothing like being on the scene every day all day so much has gone into getting this agreement we must do everything to make sure that it lasts it is also important as we look forward that we do not forget the tragedy still unfolding in sudan as i speak women continue to be raped children die from hunger and disease men continue to be murdered by the governmentsponsored janjaweed and new attacks continue to be launched against defenseless villages many of these people have been huddled in camps for over a year put yourself in their shoes for a minute you are uprooted from your home you live in a refugee camp where conditions are terrible you do not know if your family members are dead or alive you are sick weak watching people die all around you from hunger and disease now picture you have been there for over a year the tsunami in south asia demonstrates how quickly and effectively the world can respond to such terrible disasters once again we are reminded that the world has failed the people of darfur i commend the quick and generous response to the tsunami but we must not only focus on disasters as they occur but also to respond to disasters like in darfur that have gone on for decades the peace agreement between the north and south opens new doors for a comprehensive peace throughout the country and dr john garang who will now be vice president of sudan has an opportunity to play a positive role and should go to darfur to help bring about peace i have strongly supported the united states commitment to the united nations since i became chairman of the subcommittee on commerce justice state judiciary and related agencies of the committee on appropriations all unitedstates assessments to the u n have been paid in full but over the past year we have seen the united nations fight an uphill battle on darfur resolution after resolution has failed to have any impact at least two security council members china and russia have threatened to veto strong resolutions from being passed secretary general kofi annan continues to report that the situation in darfur continues to deteriorate and the government of sudan has violated the previous security council resolutions by failing to disarm and prosecute the janjaweed ngos are leaving the region secretary general annan has sent a commission on inquiry to darfur to investigate if genocide has occurred and he has the report in his hands as i speak most people believe there is genocide but whether or not they use that term it still is horrible what is taking place and no matter what you call it the facts remain innocent civilians are systematically being murdered raped and displaced and the world has failed to stop it it is time for the united nations and the international community to respond in a meaningful way i ask secretary general annan to go to darfur to confirm with his own eyes that the situation has not improved then secretary general annan should make bold recommendations and call on the security council to immediately implement them because a strong meaningful resolution should be put forward and could make a difference it is now time for secretary general annan to use his strong moral leadership he is a nobel peace prize recipient and surely the security council would take his recommendations he should use his power and prestige to plead for the people of darfur and if the security council fails to take meaningful action secretary general annan should resign in protest i am not blaming kofi annan for darfur he does not control the security council but i ask him to use his leadership to demand a new course of action from them i believe these actions could turn the attention of the world back to what is taking place in darfur resigning under protest is an act of great moral leadership and this world would respect his actions great men in history have given up their posts to force change in 1973 at the height of the watergate scandal president nixon ordered attorney general elliott richardson to fire the special prosecutor he refused and resigned in protest and later got the presidential medal of freedom william wilberforce a member of the british parliament he could have been prime minister but spoke out to abolish the slave trade and gave up being prime minister of england anything kofi annan can do to get the world to focus on darfur would be greatly admired if in the year 2005 the security council cannot deal with genocide the raping of women and the systematic burning of villages now occurring then i believe it is fair to ask what purpose is the united nations serving in the 21st century i close by adding that just yesterday the new york times reported that villages continue to burn and that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence in darfur just last week fresh attacks killed over 100 people and drove thousands more from their homes where is the international community something needs to be done now this past weekend i watched the movie hotel rwanda i urge you all to go see it it is a movie about how the world stood by as almost a million people were slaughtered in rwanda the lead actor don cheadle is nominated for an oscar and the movie is nominated as best original screen play no one who sees that movie can leave not thinking about what is happening in darfur i end by asking the question who will play the leading role in hotel sudan"], [0.8389499187469482, 0.8389499187469482, 0, "i rise today to object to a and

for the record in support of the capps amendment to h r 5386 the fy2007 interiorenvironment appropriations bill the bill before the house today includes a provision lifting a longstanding congressional ban on natural gas drilling and production in most of the outer continental shelf ocs more import than what it does however is what it fails to do for instance rather than giving states a buffer zone which allows them to block the construction of natural gas platforms within 20 miles of their shores the provision in this bill opens the ocs to drilling as close as three miles since this provision is being tacked onto an appropriations bill it does not include the critic authorizing language that will provide the department of the interior with guidance on how and where to provide for drilling and production or even grant them the authority to issue leases in addition it lifts only the congressional prohibition on ocs natural gas drilling and leaves intact the executive ban in effect until 2012 making this provision meaningless without more extensive authorizing legislation many of our colleagues have deep concems about the impact that opening our ocs to natural gas drilling and production will have on their states this is therefore not an issue we should rush into with only cursory debate in an appropriations bill rather it is one that should be carefully

their parents family caregivers live in all of our communities and they are often silent heroes ensuring family stability and helping those who struggle with disease or disability to avoid more costly institutional placements while voluntary care is personally rewarding it can result in substantial emotional physical and financial strain on the caregiver when one family member is caring for another it doesnt mean that the other responsibilities of the family simply stop children still need to be brought to school food shopping still needs to be done doctors appointments still need to be made and kept particularly when it involves the caregiver themselves they need to know that they are not alone and they need to know where to turn when the pressures of their situation become too much for them to bear respite care services relieve caregivers from daily care giving tasks on a temporary or even longterm basis many lifespan respite programs are already in place at state and local levels providing invaluable services to the families of people with chronic disease or disability yet in too many situations caregivers simply dont know how to find information about available respite care and access to these services in other cases respite care is simply unavailable to those who need it i originally introduced the lifespan respite care act in the 107th congress working with the
