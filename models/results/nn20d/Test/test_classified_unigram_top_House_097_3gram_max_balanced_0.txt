house joint reso lution 220 proclaiming raoul wallenberg to be an honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the

objection to point 3 and we ended up with about 4 out of 40 issues and nothing happened again the last moment with all due respect to my good friend from texas a man who i have worked with and will always admire and respect i would urge that the independent bankers have been against every single thing we have tried to do to straighten out the banking industry since i got on the committee what are we doing why is there a crisis there is a crisis because the judges and the regulators are running the financial institutions of the united states of america not you and i the representatives of the people where did now accounts come from they came from a judge in massachusetts because a clever lawyer found out that he could go to court so then we had the great new england experimentand that is no insult to the state of massachusetts by the waybut to change the entire banking industry of the united states because of one judges action in one state is a mistake be he the brightest judge in the entire world why did fidelity get taken over because there was not an orderly system in law of how a financial institution going into collapse should be taken over what does the bill say the bill says that a similar institution in that stateintrastateshould have the first right to take over if it can then it says no 2 a dissimilar institution in that state should have the right to take over again intrastate then it moves on and goes out it gets pretty broad similar institutions outside dissimilar institutions outside the fact of the matter is the institution is broke and outside this is only the taxpayer and the full faith andcredit of the united states the fact of the matter is that thrifts are in terrible trouble and i have heard a lot about how the small banks are not in trouble and it just gives the big banks an option to gobble them up i would suggest that if a bank is not in trouble nobody is really going to bother to buy it and they may not be in trouble i say to my good friend if in fact they are in oil leases or gas or something else but in my part of the country where small banks in small cities have huge mortgage portfolios which commercial banks normally do not have they are in every bit as much trouble as the thrift institutions why the small bank in the small town in the midwest or northeast or almost anywhere has had a long history of family service has had a long history of being friendly has had a long history of helping small business they are well overextended in their mortgage portfolios for a commerical bank they do not have a terrible lot of

with the socalled brooks amendment i would like to speak in favor of retaining the original provisions of h r 3519 the original provisions provided greater authority for the use of multiyear contractingone of the most universally supported ideas for improving the dod acquisitions process countless experts in and out of government democrats and republicans alike have documented the deterioration in the defense industrial base and have stressed that new initiatives are needed immediately to reverse this trend years of hearings and studies by the armed services committees the defense science board gao industry panels and others have demonstrated serious problems in the defense basegeneral instability increasing leadtimes and costs problems with profits productivity labor shortages and a shrinking supplier baseto name a few criticism frequently focuses on defense contracting procedures and the insufficient use of multiyear contracting the united states is the only western industrialized nation that procures contracts 1 year at a time according to gen alton slay one of the most noted experts on this subject this procedure results in lower worker out ut inefficient production runs limited contractor investment in new plants and equipment and program instability multiyear contraeting is a simple concept which allows dod to span several yearly contracts with a single contract the single contract is let at the beginning and it is then funded annuallyi through the normal appropriations and review process in the congress section 909 of h r 3519 institutes some much needed changes giving dod statutory authority for multiyear contracting it allows multiyear contracts for not more than 5 years when those at the assistant secretary level and above find that total costs would be reduced that a low risk of contract cancellation exists that demand for the item will continue and so on the section removes the contract cancellation ceiling of 5 million and requires that dod notify congress of contracts in excess of 100 million it also allows coverage of recurring costs such as advance purchase of parts when such a purchase can be made at a reduced cost the existing low cancellation ceiling has limited multiyear contracts to small purchases and prevented its costsavings features from being applied to major weapons programs i cannot stress strongly enough the need for these multiyear provisions the military departments have estimated that upward of 15 billion can be saved over the next 5 years by multiyear procurement moreover the former gao comptroller general staats has concludedand i quote multiyear procurement is an idea whose time has come because of statutory restrictions and a general reluctance on the part of congress substantial savings available through multiyear contracting have not been realized he estimates procurement savings ranging from 10 to 30 percent general staats emphasizes that in the acquisition of major weapons systems the up front commitment to a program demonstrated through multiyear contracting produces program stability and pernits scheduling economical production quantities top management in the department of defense has been working for over a year to enhance the use of multiyear contracts this effort demonstrates that officials in the past administration as well as the present administration recognized that benefits in multiyear contracting must be realized the need is 8o great that deputy secretary of defense frank carlucci directed a special review of multiyear contract as a result on may 1 1981 he issued a policy memorandum on multiyear procurement it is well conceived policy direction providing guidance on the criteria for selection funding concepts to be used assessment of benefits versus risk budget planning and control the amendment 6ffered by the government operations committee fails to address any of the problems and circumstances i have just talked about its effect will be to discourage the use of multiyear contracts by dod at a time when the congress is dramatically increasing defense spending and should be looking for ways to hold program costs to a minimum it is abundantly clear that the amendment if adopted will be interpreted by defense acquisition officials and industry officials as a restriction perhaps even a prohibition against the use of multiyear contracting more severe than the current limitation on cancellation ceiling the advantages of multiyear contracting will be lost and the loser will be the taxpayer two noted experts on the defense industry agree with my objections to the brooks amendment they are gen alton slay and mr robert fuhrman their urgent statements are filed with my disserting views to the

extensively before our subcommittee since they quoted him so much i1 asked them whether they thought the general would support the government operations committees amendment i must report that he does not mr fuhrman is currently president of lockheed missiles and space co and is also chairman of the defense science board task force on industrial responsiveness like general slay hie is in favor of section 909 of h r 3519 as reported by house armed service and is opposed to the amendment by the government operations committee in addition david stockmuan director of 0mb strongly supports the armed services committee position quoting his letter we believe very strongly that the dod should be given authority to selectively use multiyear contracting in weapons sysitems acquisitions in my judgment the government operations amendment is a poor substitute for the original section 909 provisions i would like to stress the wide support for this multiyear provision its ability to save money and strengthen our defense capabilities in the process and the facts that only tried and true programs will be contracted multiyear and that congress will still exercise annual review over the

up and down but has progressively declined during that same period of time widening the gap between the cost of production and the prices received for products grown and produced by farmers it graphically illustrates the information which we have that over the last decade the cost of production has increased for the american farmer by about 2a times whereas the prices received for the products produced by the farmers have only increased about 2 times within that differential thousands of farm families have been forced off of the farm and tens of thousands of bankruptcies are
