the upcoming election in mexico when mexicans go to the polls in what is expected to be record numbers on august 21 the electoral process will reflect a confluence of political will presidential vision for reform compromise by the major political parties and insistence on integrity in the electoral process by mexican voters significantly more than 90 percent of the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes which promise to change the face of the electoral process in mexico the mexicans have faced many challenges throughout this electoral reform era and campaign season not the least of which is the trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican history as our neighbors south of the border elect a new president 500 members of the chamber of deputies 96 senate seats as well as political leaders in 6 states and the federal district of mexico city because of the sweeping electoral reforms pushed by president salinas the united nations is now on the ground providing trainiing and technical assistance for domestic election observers additionally international visitors have been in vited and adjustments have been adopted in recent months to accommodate the concerns of the various political parties i believe the resolution introduced by my friend bob torricelli reflects both our hopes and concerns about the upcoming national elections in mexico as ranking member of the western hemisphere subcommittee i rise in support of the resolution as reported by the foreign affairs committee and urge my colleagues to join us in this show of support and encouragement to the mexicans and their government in closing i wholeheartedly concur with one of the conclusions of the july 12 agreement that reaffirmation to the state of law and peace not end with the 21 august election process a climate of peace and harmony as well as adherence to the state of law will contribute to encouraging the economic environment promoting

became the first africanamecan woman to speak publicly against slavery after being freed she crossed the country speaking out at abolition rallies in 1947 when he joined the brooklyn dodgers jackie robinson became the first africanamerican to play majorleague baseball jackie distinguished himself as one of baseballs ailtime greats by compiling a long list of accomplishments including rookie of the year in 1947 most valuable player in the national league in 1949 and a lifetime 311 batting average most importantly his entrance into the game paved the way for other africanamerican players to play major league baseball in 1962 he was inducted into the baseball hall of fame as we celebrate the accomplishments of africanamericans this month it is important to realize that what africanamericans have ac complished should not solely be heralded in relation to race this celebration should not only highlight accomplishments of africanamericans it should make clear the vital

provided by current law two nothing in this title shall be construed to grant powers of zoning or land use to any management entity for an american heritage area it is a prohibition of acquisition of real property there cannot be a taking a management entity and i am quoting directly from the law a management entity for an american heritage area may not use federal funds received under this title to acquire real property or an interest in real property and lastly and this is a provision the gentleman from utah put in no provision of this title shall be construed to require any change in land use regulation as a condition of approval by a management plan or a management plan by the secretary clearly it does not invade in any way private property rights and it is spelled out in the law why

increase last year in the national parks in usage was 10 percent yosemite was rationing people they had to wait outside the gate and get a number to get in and with the increased population it faces

can get to them on a daily basis to take a walk with their family talk about family values this is where the family value can go out daily and weekly and take a hike where boy scout troops girl scout

safeguards those safeguards were part of the very basis of the panels conclusion unfortunately not all of those safeguards were included in the nih legislation we are now considering in fact the

during the past year we received disturbing reports from iran on the continued repression of the bahai community we learned that the tehran authorities have destroyed gravesites located in the principal bahai cemetery in tehran bodies have been removed to unknown destinations and grave markers have been sold to construction firms to be used as ordinary building stones the municipal authorities reportedly intend to build a cultural center on the site of the cemetery these acts are consistent with guidelines detailed in a secret iranian government plan which came to light last year which calls for suppression of the bahai community in iran and the destruction of its cultural roots it is frighteningly similar to hitlers plans for dealing with the jewish community in germany the desecration of the bahai cemetery in tehran is not only a despicable attempt by the iranian government to add to the misery of the living by denying to their loved ones interred at this site the
