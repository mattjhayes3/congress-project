want from congress they want us to invest in education invest in research and invest in innovation so that america can remain a leader in the global economy they want us to invest in infrastructure build bridges highways clean energy and cut our dependence on foreign oil because when we make it in america thats when america will make it americans can make it cut yes what we ought to cut are the republican giveaways to the big oil companies to the wall street barons to the hedge fund managers who enjoy massive tax breaks thats where the cuts ought to be they ought to be cut out and what of this legislation thats before us we ought to vote no cut what doesnt create jobs for middle class families like republican giveaways to big oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to h r 2560 the cut cap and balance act this bill is an extreme version of the republican budget plan that would make permanent the dangerous budgetary and constitutional measures that would destroy medicare and medicaid and reduce social security benefits for those who need them the most the bill would also handicap the governments ability to respond to economic downturns and create jobs and it fails to address some of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of which we continue to wage this bill does nothing to end the tax breaks we currently provide for millionaires and billionaires hedge fund managers and oil companies nor does it address runaway pentagon spending based on cbos most conservative estimates the dod alone is projected to spend nearly 300 billion on the afghan and iraqi wars from 2012 through 2015 and estimates by harvard researchers which take into account longterm costs like caring for our veterans put the total cost of these wars in the trillions rather than ending tax breaks for corporations and millionaires and billionaires and bringing our troops home from afghanistan my friends on the other

avoid people going to nursing homes they can lead a better quality of life and we save money so i just think it is really unfortunate today that after so many years of a bipartisan effort to deal with

choose to turn to another topica topic that is important to many americans a topic that relates to an important anniversary we are recognizing today we are highlighting the third anniversary of president obamas failed stimulus package the president promised 3 years ago that the stimulus would create what he characterized as millions of jobs but today unfortunately devastatingly there are nearly 13 million people in america who are still unemployed and many millions more have even given up on looking for jobs three years ago the white house said that because of the stimulus package unemployment would not exceed 8 percent that has not happened in fact the unemployment rate has topped 8 percent for 36 straight months nowthe longest stretch of high unemployment since the great depression the congressional budget office predicts it is going to go even longer we will not see sub8 percent unemployment according to the cbo until 2014 the president sold his stimulus package to the american people by claiming he would make immediate investments in what he characterized as shovelready jobs but last june the president acknowledged that shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected nevertheless a lot of money has been spent as we have been waiting for these jobs to materializejobs that never quite came about in fact some of it was spent in ways that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy for example consider some of the ways in which this stimulus money has been spent mr president 760 000 was spent on interactive dance software 1 2 million was spent on a train museum 2 million was spent to study ant behavior 762 000 was spent to study improvised musici am not sure what that is but i am sure it is lovely not necessarily deserving of scarce federal resources 300 000 to track weather on other planetsgreat if one lives on another planet not so great if one lives on earth in a country that has accumulated an unprecedented debt exceeding 15 trillion 153 000 for an indoor water park and 712 000 to develop a machinegenerated humor systemin other words a joke machine this big joke is on the american taxpayer unfortunately it is no laughing matter in the last 3 years we have added more than 4 trillion to the national debt we have recorded the three largest annual deficits in our nations history and we are on pace for a fourth straight deficit exceeding 1 trillion this week the president submitted a budget that calls for adding 11 trillion in new debt over the next decade his own treasury secretary calls the level of spending unsustainable and it is despite the overwhelming evidence that his stimulus package has failed the president has called for additional increases in spending i know the president is a good man i also know he faced a difficult economy when he took office but the president is unwilling to tell the truth to the american people about what lies ahead about some of the challenges we face i think he needs to do so and he needs to acknowledge the fact that this stimulus package has failed so we can avoid making similar mistakes in the future today we cannot celebrate the anniversary of the presidents stimulus rather
