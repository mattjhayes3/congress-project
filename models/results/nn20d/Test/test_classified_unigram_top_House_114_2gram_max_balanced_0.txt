nothing like the attacks on orlando paris newtown or san bernardino ever happen again congress should immediately move forward and pass the denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act this commonsense bill would prohibit suspected terrorists from possessing guns or explosives keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of people who wish to do our country harm is a solution that we should all be able to get behind the hateful attack in orlando also reminds us once more of the growing threat of isisinspired radical islamic terrorist on unitedstates soil is real and cannot be ignored or downplayed congress must reassert leadership in the fight against isis by passing legislation to hold the president accountable for developing a comprehensive plan to destroy isis through congressional oversight hearings we must also ensure that federal agencies and local law enforcement are effectively communicating with each other to identify international and homegrown terror threats through both traditional security approaches and social media internationally congress must act to cut off sources of funding to other radical islamic terror groups by restoring crippling sanctions on iran the recent agreement which frankly shipped billions of dollars to the worlds largest state sponsor of terror while helping finance organizations like hamas and hezbollah is simply unacceptable at home we cannot allow the tired partisan bickering to distract us from the difficult but necessary work of preventing gun violence we need to bridge the partisan divide and put the best interests of our country before politics a good first step is the legislation that i helped introduce with former congresswoman gabby giffords to require universal background checks on firearm purchases the vast majority of the american people support this commonsense idea and it is past time congress moves forward with this proposal that will keep more people safe we also need to improve communications so that local law enforcement is notified when someone attempts to purchase a gun and fails a required background check my colleague congressman mike quigley introduced a commonsense bill to make this fix which i strongly support other important efforts to prevent gun violence include my bill with congresswoman debbie dingell to prevent domestic abusers from being able to purchase weapons this proposal would help again prohibit firearm trafficking used to evade background checks and also a longoverdue increase in mental health resources in short there are numerous commonsense proposals that will keep guns out of the hands of those that should not have them while protecting our second amendment rights it is time that we take action there is no quick and easy solution to all
