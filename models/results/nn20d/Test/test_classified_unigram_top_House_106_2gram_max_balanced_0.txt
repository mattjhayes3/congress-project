simple terms a 1 increase in the minimum wage is enough for a family of four to buy groceries for 7 months or pay rent for 5 months now one of my colleagues said we are trying to promote prosperity and happiness i can tell my colleagues that we are not trying to promote prosperity but for sure coming from a poor family i can say that when there is a little more on the table or the landlord is not knocking at the door for the rent yes it brings a lot of happiness now i would have preferred that we were debating a clean minimumwage bill one free bf specialinterest exemptions but reality dictates otherwise american men and women cannot and should not have to wait any longer for congress to provide them with a living wage this increase is long overdue it is unacceptable to delay the american worker this pay raise even one additional year a 3year increase as proposed by the bill would cost a fulltime yearround worker more than 900 over 2 years now 900 may not sound like a lot of money to members of congress but to millions of americans who make a minimum wage it can sometimes make the difference in raising them above the poverty level america has achieved the longest period

what we think ought to happen we ought to have a meeting we ought to discuss these things we ought to settle them i would point out parenthetically that paragraph number 2 common sense gun safety measure that prevent felons fugitives and stalkers from obtaining firearms and children from getting access to guns is already the law the brady bill the brady law title 18 section 922 g already prohibits fugitives stalkers and felons from buying or possessing a gun and children already cannot buy handguns i am proposing in my offer a ban on assault weapons being available to youngsters now i have been proposing a gun control bill for many many months last november 4 i sent a copy of it to the gentleman from missouri and we have been talking about it on and off for lo these many months the proposal that i have offered accepts the trigger lock requirement in fact as a standalone bill it passed 311115 a juvenile brady that says if a juvenile commits a disqualifying crime they will never be eligible for a gun that passed 39527 we passed a ban on these large ammunition clips 10 cartridges or more that passed by voice vote and then we had a prohibition on juveniles from possessing assault weapons which i mentioned earlier that passed 25469 so we have already passed these things we could have the makings of a decent gun bill there is one sticking point and that is the socalled gun show loophole now we are confronted with two versions of a solution to the gun show loophole we have the solution of the gentleman from michigan out here which is in my humble opinion unacceptable because it limits the instant check time to one day now we can get 95 percent of the applicants in one day but there is 5 percent that require three business days they are not easily cleared up they are not easily answered and those are the difficult ones those are the ones that may have criminal records those may be the people we do not want to get a gun and therefore we need three business days the gentleman from michigan does not allow that so i cannot accept that now over here we have the other democrat gun show provision and that is by the great senator from new jersey senator lautenberg well his bill literally defines gun shows out of existence he has the three business days that is fine but he also requires such burdensome provisions on people who are conducting a gun show that it is just unsupportable it is too much the other way i propose meeting in the middle a compromise that requires every gun sold at a gun show to have an instant check the purchaser that requires three business days for the 5 percent that we have trouble getting the instant check on and creating a class of instantcheck registrars who are not licensed gun dealers but nonetheless are certified to be able to provide the instant check so the volume can be dealt with now that is a solution that meets the gun show loophole it tightens that existing law gives us the trigger locks gives us a ban on the large ammunition clips gives us a juvenile brady keeps assault weapons from the children what are we waiting for nobody will talk to me the gentleman from michigan has written me a letter saying he will not negotiate with me unless and until the senator calls a meeting of the conferees let us confront him with an accomplished fact a fait accompli let us say here is our proposal now all i need is

the form of class actions and whether or not one believes they should be removed to federal court or not my colleagues should not support carving out individual sectors of our economy or individual types of lawsuits that is exactly how this amendment was treated in a bipartisan fashion by the committee on the judiciary in the markup of this bill when this particular amendment or one very like it was defeated by a bipartisan 16 to 6 vote there are good reasons why it was rejected there and there are good reasons why it should be rejected here this industryspecific exemption from federal jurisdiction makes no sense it is like a bill of attainder it irrationally singles out one industry and slams the federal courthouse door in its face all of us strive to be sure that justice is blind but when one identifies one group of people and says they are not entitled to the same treatment under the law that everyone else is justice is not blind the amendment is wholly inconsistent with what the framers had in mind in establishing diversity jurisdiction in article iii of our constitution they wanted to allow interstate businesses to have claims against them heard in federal court so as to avoid local biases nowhere in this concept is the idea that certain industries should be exempted from this right that certain kinds of businesses are less entitled to federal court protection one may not like gun manufacturers but think of the things that one does like and consider whether if a similar amendment were offered to single out something that is important to one and say that those who promote and support that particular idea that particular industry whatever the case might be that they are not entitled to sit in the same forum of justice that everyone else in this country is entitled to the amendment clearly is designed to single out the firearms industry because in some quarters it is unpopular but that is exactly what the framers of the constitution were trying to avoid they are trying to ensure a fair evenhanded federal court forum for defendants that may otherwise be hailed into a local court less concerned about protecting the rights of an outofstate company it is very interesting that in the committee report the additional dissenting views submitted by the gentleman from new york and others on the gun issue makes a big point of the fact that the naacp has filed a class action against the gun industry seeking to recover for money that the public sector must pay for the consequences of gun violence the report goes on to say that we should not handicap such important civil suits before they have even begun what i find very interesting about that point is that the naacp filed their lawsuit in federal court not state court that choice presumably was made because the lawyers filing the naacp suit know that the federal courts are more appropriate for dealing with these interstate issues presented by these cases this bill would make it easier for groups like the naacp to bring such cases in federal court because it works both ways it expands the rights of plaintiffs to bring interstate cases in federal court as well as expanding the ability of defendants to remove interstate cases to federal court for all of these reasons i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment"]], "top_unsure": [[7.539987564086914e-06, 0.4999924600124359, 0, "if the
