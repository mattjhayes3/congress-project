work and dedicated effort by a number of distinguished members of both the merchant marine and fisheries and the science space and technology committees working together we have crafted a proposal that incorporates the best features of our two versions the fundamental purpose of h r 4008 is to authorize noaas important ocean and coastal programs for the next two fiscal years these include mapping and charting observation and prediction estuarine and coastal assessment the great lakes environmental research laboratory global climate change the saftonstallkennedy fishery program and various marine services in addition title four of the bill includes misceflaneous provisions which authorize various reports concerning noaas nautical charting fleet modernization and research programs the bill also includes the text of three bills which passed the house in marchh r 3886 h r 2063 and h r 1394dealing with the flower garden banks national marine sanctuary the national coastal resources research and development institute and a noaa great lakes office finally the bill incorporates a slightly modified text of h r 4236 a comprehensive national undersea research program authorization reported by the merchant marine committee on may 11 while i generally support most of the programs authorized in this legislation the bill authodzes a total of 14 million over 2 years for the global learning and observation to benefit the environment program as you may remember when the house considered the commerce justice state and judiciary appropriations bill this year i offered an amendment eliminating funding for globe the amendment was defeated on a tie vote i also sought to strike the authorization for the program when h 4008 was before the merchant marine and fisheries committee globe is the brainchild of vice president gore while i have great respect for the vice president it is legitimate to question whether the united states should be spending 7 million in noaa funds to have schoolchildren from around the world take environmental measurements of questionable scientific value i objected to this program based on my concerns that there seemed tobe no clear focus that funding was projected to grow at an alarming rate that funds would flow to foreign countries like bahrain croatia and papua new guinea and that noaa had reprogrammed a half million dollars to establish an eightperson globe office without proper notice or authorization by the congress however i have been assured by the vice president that the administration does not intend to have the taxpayers of this nation finance the globe program at a substantially higher rate in the future in fact noaas share of the program will be limited to the 7 million authorized in fiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 1996 rising eventually to 12 million in later years in addition i was pleased to see that the administrator of noaa in his testimony before the subcommittee on space on july 19 announced that all us dollars appropriated to the program would remain in the united states foreign countries who wish to participate in the globe program will have to bear their own costs the vice president also indicated that globe would take advantage of existing technologies and programs to minimize the costs of the program one of these is the mickey leland satellite program established in honor of the late congressman from houston tx who gave his life fighting hunger and poverty in africa the leland satellite network to be funded by aid to provide health and agricultural information to african nations can also serve as a conduit for the types of environmental information collected under globe i am pleased that mickeys legacy will be expanded and i thank the vice president for his commitment to fund the leland satellite network i have also been informed that a small advisory committee is being formed to help shape the program and give it some direction i hope that the advisory committee will represent a crosssection of interest groups and that all efforts will be made to minimize its costs i urge the committee to examine other federal programs involving the scientific education of young children and build on their foundation for example the national science foundation already has a globetype program in place in the united states and many american school districts participate in weather observation programs in conjunction with local weather stations finally the provision authored by the gentleman from wisconsin which requires a minimum dollarfordollar nonfederal match before any globe monies can be obligated beginning in fiscal year 1996 goes a long way in ensuring that the program will truly incorporate a privatefgovernmental partnership by requiring a funding match the intent here is to force a commitment of dollars or equipment up front and not the types of soft matching requirements of administrative overhead allowed under other federal research programs on july 19 the noaa admninistrator stated that the private investment in globe would be orders ofmagnitude greater than the public investment if this is true then the matching requirement wil not be a hardship and should eventually negate the need for further federal funding noaa plans to establish a private foundation to seek funds for the programs as early as this year this is a sound idea and i hope the foundation functions well if i could direct s7 million of federal funds globe would not be my choice however the funds have been appropriated for fiscal year 1995 and the program seems to be evolving away from the bloated foreign aid giveaway i and many of my colleagues had feared therefore i do not plan to offer any amendments to kill the globe program however i will be monitoring the situation very carefully and i will request oversight hearings on this program early in the 104th congress other than this one loncem i urge my colleagues to support this bill noaa may not be the largest federal agency but it represents the lions share of the department of commerces budget and personnel many noaa programs are critical to maintaining the

from new jersey for crafting a very thoughtful resolution that i think expresses and embodies our hopes as well as our concerns about the upcoming election in mexico when mexicans go to the polls in what is expected to be record numbers on august 21 the electoral process will reflect a confluence of political will presidential vision for reform compromise by the major political parties and insistence on integrity in the electoral process by mexican voters significantly more than 90 percent of the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes which promise to change the face of the electoral process in mexico the mexicans have faced many challenges throughout this electoral reform era and campaign season not the least of which is the trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican history as our neighbors south of the border elect a new president 500 members of the chamber of deputies 96 senate seats as well as political leaders in 6 states and the federal district of mexico city because of the sweeping electoral reforms pushed by president salinas the united nations is now on the ground providing trainiing and technical assistance for domestic election observers additionally international visitors have been in vited and adjustments have been adopted in recent months to accommodate the concerns of the various political parties i believe the resolution introduced by my friend bob torricelli reflects both our hopes and concerns about the upcoming national elections in mexico as ranking member of the western hemisphere subcommittee i rise in support of the resolution as reported by the foreign affairs committee and urge my colleagues to join us in this show of support and encouragement to the mexicans and their government in closing i wholeheartedly concur with one of the conclusions of the july 12 agreement that reaffirmation to the state of law and peace not end with the 21 august
