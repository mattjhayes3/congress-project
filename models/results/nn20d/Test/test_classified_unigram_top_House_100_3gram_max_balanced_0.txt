over 2 5 billion in military assistance from the soviet bloc yet today were asking for only 36 million to aid the freedom fighters and only 10 percent of that can be used to purchase weapons

sanctions to pressure the nicaraguan government into changing its policies the single greatest issue in determining this nations policy toward the situation in nicaragua is whether or not we are willing to accept the establishment of another marxistleninist beachheadlike cubain the western hemisphere to fail to recognize the threat the sandinista government poses to the security of central america and the united states is to bury our heads in the sand the head of our own intelligence agency bill casey tells us that since 1979 when the sandinistas seized control over the government they have developed the best equipped military in the region he estimates the sandinistas have 6 000 to 7 500 cuban advisers and another several hundred other communists from the soviet union and eastern european soviet bloc countries to assist in their military buildup and consolidation of power if we allow the soviets and cubans to develop this powerful beachhead in central america and that ferment spreads our nation will know a security threat that we cannot abide clearly there is only one choice consistent with our national security and foreign policy objectives we must apply pressure from all possible sources to make the sandinistas call a ceasefire and come to the negotiating table with the democratic resistance known as the contras this will be especially difficult at a time when nicaraguas conversion to a marxistleninists state is 80percent complete they are already suppressing the press and expelling those not on their side they are arresting and imprisoning political opponents they are exporting communism to other countries they are tightening down more on the private sector and the evidence goes on down the line that the sandinistas are crs426 intent on following everything cuba has done it is also an unfortunate political reality that marxist governments do not revert to democratic forms of government not one of the some 21 countries that have gone communist have been reversed in nicaragua however there is somewhat of a unique situation a grassroots resistance movement is fighting for a democratic form of government and the same kinds of freedoms this country enjoys but the leaders of the democratic resistance emphasize shortages of food medicine and clothing which severely impede their ability to successfully wage their fight by passing the michel amendment we can encourage and help the democratic resistance continue and bestow legitimacy on their efforts thus we would send a clear message to the sandinistas and to neighboring countries whose borders have been violated that we intend to protect the freedoms and the democratic form of government in this hemisphere if we are going to provide aidhumanitarian or otherto the contras we had better do it now and in a fashion that doesnt slowly bleed them to death and diminish the strongest incentive for the sandinistas to negotiate there are those critics who charge any support for the democratic resistance will result in the united states entering the war in nicaragua with our own military forces the president himself has clearly told us his administration does not seek the military overthrow of the sandinista government or to replace it with supporters of the old somoza regime we certainly dont want another vietnam on our hands we certainly must never again get into a situation that we dont intend to win but whether or not this country would ever have to make the tough decision of military intervention is not the issue at this time lets first utilize all the peaceful means that are available through the michel amendment to try to accomplish our objective of preventing another marxistleninist beachhead we better not keep sticking our heads in the sand and say the situation in nicaragua will go away by itself because that simply will not happen its a lot easier to pay for peace now by helping those grassroots resistance forces who want freedom for themselves and are willing to fight for it than to pay for war with our own blood on a far larger scale once that beachhead has grown into a monstrous threat that cannot be stopped in any other way i

would also commend manuel lujan ranking republican on the full committee for his efforts in bringing the bill to the house finally i want to thank tom lewis ranking republican on the transportation aviation and materials subcommittee for his cooperation expertise and dedication to keeping america first in aviation members of the subcommittee worked long and hard in carefully reviewing the nasa aeronautical program and the 1988 budget request we found that although the dollar amount for aeronautical r d is small 414 2 million recommended by the committee this year the payoff is very large this is true because nasa emphasizes the highrisk longterm research and technology that industry is financially unable or unwilling to undertake such efforts provide the foundation for future aircraft and engines which return many times their initial cost to our economy in a very real sense nasas aeronautical r d is an investment in our countrys future for example in 1987 the united states suffered an alltime record foreign trade deficit of 171 2 billion and yet as bad as this was it would have been 17 billion worse had it not been for the favorable contribution of aerospace products the bulk of which were civil aircraft unitedstates suppliers have built the vast majority of the free worlds civil air fleet by dollar value our airlines are our best ambassadors offering superior quality safety comfort and reliability at economical costs they speak well of america to operator and user alike of course these results did not just happen they came because we have consistently had the best products and one of the big reasons for that has been the longstanding partnership between government and industry in developing new aeronautical technology because of this the committee on science space and technology has repeatedly urged the administration and the congress to increase the resources devoted to aeronautical r d we have pointed to the many longterm benefits of such investment which are reflected in billions of dollars in sales of unitedstates aircraft both here and abroad and in millions of jobs for americans yet in spite of its proven cost benefits the nasa aeronautics program has not kept pace with the relentless pressure from our competitors both military and commercial in fact nasa budgets for aeronautics in this decade have not even kept up with inflation there arent many government programs that can make that claim furthermore anyone familiar with the dramatic increases in both the cost and complexity of new technology in the last few years knows that a level budget wont produce the same results as it once did it simply costs more today to achieve each increment of improvement in fuel efficiency or safety or performance despite decades in which american companies dominated the world jet transport market our share of that market fell to 65 percent last year down from 84 percent during the 1970s clearly if this becomes a trend we will have lost another industry one of our few remaining winners because of this i believe the committees recommendation is at the low end of what is actually needed in my view international conditions call for expanding nasas aeronautical program not curtailing it the committee also approved funding 63 8 million to begin a long overdue rehabilitation of certain aging wind tunnels these facilities have served our country well for years giving our aeronautical scientists the tools to keep the united states out front in aviation but many are old and are badly in need of repairs to restore them to productive use and safe condition finally in the aviation area the committee considered nasas request for transatmospheric research and technology this is nasas contribution to the joint nasa dod national aerospaceplane program an effort to advance and prove the technology for highspeed hypersonic flight if successful this program could lead the way to several attractive applications including a singlestagetoorbit space transportation system and a hypersonic commercial air transportsometimes called the orient express the committee feels it is necessary to continue with this program so that the technology will be ready in the mid1990s when we will need it to support the successful commercial development of space furthermore we feel it is vital for nasa to be involved fully in this

house resolution 111 which contains several articles of impeachment and in which specific violations of our laws as well as constitutional provisions clearly indicate that the congress has an overriding responsibility and had best confront this problem sooner rather than later there is no question about the fact that the president is headed in an undeviating way into direct military intervention with our troops in central america what we have had thus far has been fragmentary participation in the month of may in less than a month and a week he will introduce over 50 000 soldiers just from our department of the army into honduras for supposedly training exercises which training exercises were inaugurated at the same time and coincidentally with his naming of a socalled bipartisan commission on central america while he announced the formation of the commission he simultaneously announced the greatest concentration of military strength in the history of this region of the world with a constant presence of the sea on both sides of the isthmus there on the pacific on the caribbean and over the air and on the land involving at no time less than 30 000 of our military a total of better than 17 have died in this endeavor there was very little notice it was really never reported but nevertheless they did what is inexorable is the presidents undeviating intentiontime is running out on himto intervene if i would hazard any kind of guess i would say by the month of june we will see the headlines and then of course the rest is history but at this point the very fact that the congress has abdicated its traditional role as set forth in the constitution in article i and it is a good reason why those who wrote the constitution and who exactly 200 years ago were engaged in that process at this time in the month of march that they devised that article i would be the policymaking body of the country the congress of the united states and hesitated long before they could reach an agreement as to the creation and establishment of such an office as we call the presidency in fact the words usually used were chief magistrate it was about this time of the year that john adams then minister to london from our fledgling nation concerned very much by the fact that this great historical and auspicious occasion on the attempt on the part of delegates from the various states and colonies to forge an instrument as a result of the first 10 years of rather failed nationhood government with the first and second continental congresses who fought the revolutionary war and then the articles of confederation i think we should note that during the first 10 years of our nationhood there was not any such thing as the office of a president or an executive chief because there was good reason for that they feared what the lessons of history clearly and demonstrably have shown all along john adams so fearful as he was a very very careful scholar deep researcher into the history of the experiences of mankind with government and particularly that very precious thing that we call selfgovernment which was a radical revolutionary concept the world was governed by kings or potentates who said that their sovereignty that is their source of power was from god well you could not go any higher than that or you had czars or you had oligarchies the select chosen few the idea that the people would be the source of power all source of power all sovereignty emanating from the people was just something that was not considered at all short of being highly revolutionary and radical thus the birth of our american revolutionary effort john adams then wrote to the various delegates particularly those who were here like james madison and wilson and mason pointing out that the only thing history showed was that where you had a separation of powers you had success in the foundations and in the formulations of peoples governments or democracies that where you had any kind of concentration of sovereignty in any one of these three basic organs in mankinds struggle to erect governments that you would not have freedom that you would eventually have tyranny and oppression so he gave us examples the experience of rome at the time that the republic was fading and men such as cicero were arguing hard and explaining why they had to have this separation of powers and fighting against what eventually became concentrated in the caesars of rome so today we live at a time when that dilemma confronts us as never before in our history during the period known as the nixon administration period and the very very cataclysmic things that followed for the first time in the history of our republic an unelected president two unelected vice presidents i am sure that those who wrote the constitution must have turned over over at least 50 times in their graves because this is exactly what it was they feared the most that was the result of the 25th amendment which i voted against and spoke against on this house floor i was one of just about 28 who voted no but the only one who gave his reasons in the record never in my worst fears or nightmares in saying what i said at the time that it was reminiscent the legislation was reminiscent of the old senate intrigue and conspiracy in ancient rome and in more modern times that third republic in france that winston churchill so well described as a maze and a puzzle encased in an enigma and all with intrigue and counterintrigue and power struggles within the ruling classes and of course the downfall of that republic to the german invasion and the overwhelming of the french countryside and french citizens and the occupation and the loss of its freedom to that invasion the facts are that we live in a similar period of time in that eternal vigilance as the price of liberty has no greater immediate and clear significance to us than today it is imperceptible as history shows when free people lose their freedom it is also true that the worst of slaves are corrupted free men we may without even a whimper much less of any threat of external invasion have indeed not only sown the seeds of the destruction of our tremendous government which some of us still retain the faith that demonstrates the ability of the people to govern themselves that in the long run the people know what is best for them that no matter what shortrun apparent victories of the oligarchan few that in the long haul it is the people who know best what is best for them of course democracy is disorderly democracy is not neat democracy is not very careful about the reverential spirit to the mighty and that bothers some particularly those who hunger for power will yield all to satisfy that power but again the history of mankind is as in the case of those great amassers of wealth it is never satiated for some good reason even in our scriptures they say he who loveth silver shall never be satisfied and that is true this is the reason why governments have been created as a means of defending the greatest interest of the greatest number the weak and the vulnerable from the mighty and the ambitious and the bold in the words of james madison how so are we losing that for the very same reason that the current administration and president seem to be mired in an unending tale and one yet to be told of scandalous conduct and illegal conduct we have been condemned before the world tribunal of justice several years ago for gross violations of international law for state terrorismwhich is what it amounts toin the very case of nicaragua which is at the bottom of all of the troubles that a very mixedup president is in today though probably assured very confidently that with the proper circumstances and with the proper conjunction of events by junebecause time is on him he does not have much after this yearhe must have an acceptable and at least for the moment an acceptance on the part of the american people for what will be a very costly venture to the treasure and to the blood of our men in this illbegotten course toward direct military intervention in a meaningful way with 50 000 of our military within shooting distance of what the president considers an enemy and who stands accused and convicted before world law of using illegal and unjust means to do what to overthrow a government that he sends an ambassador with credentials to recognize as the legal and duly elected government of that people and that nation so we cannot have it both ways we the american people through our representatives must either speak out or forever abdicate at a critical junction when it is absolutely necessary that these coordinate coequal independent separate branches of the government rise to the occasion for the greatest interest of the greatest number and that of our children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren as we compel them if this president has his way to

enforcement exemption of the foiaexemption 7became effective upon passage the remaining provisions relating to fees and fee waivers become effective at the end of this month there have been several recent developments with respect to the implementation of the fee and fee waiver provisions of the amended foia that i would like to discuss today the first is the issuance by the office of management and budget of a uniform foia fees schedule and guidelines these guidelines can be found in the federal register of march 27 1987 beginning on page 10012 the freedom of information reform act marks the first time that omb was given a formal role under the foia omb was required to promulgate guidelines providing for a uniform schedule of fees for all agencies agencies are specifically required to issue regulations that conform to the omb guidelines one of the major reasons why omb was assigned this task was because of general dissatisfaction in the congress with the guidance that the justice department has issued in recent years i believe that omb approached its responsibilities under the freedom of information reform act in good faith in drafling its guidance omb considered the language of the law the legislative history and the congressional intent nevertheless i have a number of major disagreements with the results my most serious problem with the omb guidelines is that they may well overstep the authority granted to omb the law very carefully limited ombs role to providing a uniform schedule of fees the law distinguishes between this schedule and other procedures and guidelines that are required under the foia ombs final guidelines appear to include some guidance on matters that are not strictly related to a uniform schedule of fees as a result these portions of the omb guidelines are not binding on agencies the most significant area where the guidelines overstep the statutory line is in the definitions congress specifically declined to provide specific definitions for terms such as news media and commercial use these are admittedly difficult concepts and the intent was to allow each agency to make a casebycase determination ombs role was limited to the promulgation of a uniform schedule of fees and not to telling agencies how to interpret the substantive parts of the law these definitional determinations were left to the agencies ombs definition of commercial use provides a good example of the shortcomings of the guidelines omb defines commercial use as referring to a request from a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial trade or profit interests of the requester the clear congressional intent supports only the use of a profitmaking standard to determining whether a use can be treated as commercial under the foia the words proposed by omb commercial trade or profit interestsare new overly broad unclear and unhelpful similarly troubling is the definition of news that was included as part of ombs definition of news media omb considers news to be information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public there are several problems here first ombs definition of news is broad vague and useless how could an agency determine that an item of information that a reporter wants to include in a news story would not be of current interest to the public any piece of information that an agency doesnt want to release is of interest to the public simply by virtue of the agencys attempt to restrict access second congress specifically rewrote part of the foia to remove any implication that agencies were to make determinations about what is news agencies responding to foia requests from reporters are not supposed to make editorial judgments about news value ombs definition appears to invite agencies to make these editorial judgments i hope that agencies resist this invitation there are similar difficulties with other definitions particularly the definition of educational institutions ombs final language has no basis in the law the legislative history or in the draft guidance that was issued for public comment in addition there are a number of other small discrepancies between the statute and the guidelines nevertheless the omb guidelines still have some value and should help to promote more uniformity among agency fee schedules the problems presented by the guidelines will be avoided if agencies quietly decide to ignore the questionable portions and to apply the foia in each case in the manner that congress intended the second recent development in the implementation of the freedom of information reform act is the issuance by the justice department of an april 2 1987 memorandum entitled new foia fee waiver policy guidance from stephen j markman assistant attorney general for legal policy the one word that best describes this guidance is dishonest the justice department has no authority to issue binding guidance on foia matters by deliberately assigning omb the task of preparing guidelines that are binding on agencies congress underscored its lack of confidence in the justice department as well as the departments lack of authority the new guidance illustrates on its first page why this lack of confidence is justified the memorandum states that the department stands committed to encouraging agencies to waive fees under the foia whenever the statutory fee waiver standard is met the problem here is that agencies are required to waive fees whenever the statutory fee waiver standard is met the justice department is not committed to requiring or forcing agencies to obey the law with respect to the granting of fee waivers the department can force agencies to grant required fee waivers by refusing to defend unlawful fee waiver denials in court nevertheless the department demonstrates its lack of interest in enforcing the foia fee waiver rules by its lukewarn encouragement of agencies to obey the law in interpreting the foias fee waiver provisions the department refused to consider any of the legislative history for the fee waiver provision the guidelines reject the statements made by senator leahythe sponsor of the language at issueby myself and by others on the grounds that there was no actual floor debate on the freedom of information reform act that distinction is irrelevant and more importantly untrue i delivered a speech on the floor when the bill that became public law 99570 was debated my remarks were discussed in advance with the ranking minority member of my subcommittee and with other members of the house who had expressed any concern about or interest in the foia why did the department misstate the record i think the answer is obvious the department doesnt like the foia and it especially doesnt like the fact that congress has intentionally made the foia easier to use by liberalizing the fee waiver rules since there is nothing in the legislative history to support the departments objectives the department has decided to ignore the legislative history for the fee waiver standard the department has however taken a contradictory position with respect to the legislative history of the law enforcement provisions of the freedom of information reform act the department agrees with some of the floor statements that were made when the law enforcement provisions of the bill were debated in fact in at least two court cases the department has filed briefs quoting approvingly from these statements but when the same type of floor statements included expressions of congressional intent regarding fees and fee waivers that did not suit the departments view of the law the department decided that the statements had no value the fee waiver guidance misstates the record in order to justify its disregard for the legislative history the department offers another basis for ignoring the legislative history of the fee waiver standard it contends that the plain meaning of the standard may be readily determined from its language therefore it may be presumed that there is no need to look at the legislative history this is all very nice except that the department found it necessary to issue 12 single space pages of advice on the fee waiver standard the standard itself is a single sentence of a few lines if the plain meaning was so obvious why did the department feel compelled to produce so much guidance despite its length the guidance managed to ignore a number of points of considerable relevance for example the department forgot to mention the fact that both the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over the foia severely criticized earlier justice department guidance on fee waivers see senate committee on the judiciary senate report no 98221 at 1011 report to accompany s 774 the freedom of information reform act and house committee on government operations house report 99832 at 1213report to accompany h r 4862 the freedom of information act amendments of 1986 both of these legislative reports accompanied bills amending the foia but neither bill became law both reports were cited when the freedom of information reform act was considered by the congress the house report cited above characterized the 1983 justice department guidancethe socalled rose memorandumas consisting largely of quotations selectively culled from court decisions to suggest as many reasons as possible for agencies to use in denying fee waivers the same may be said of the new guidance there is no objective evenhanded discussion of the case law on foia fee waivers instead language that supports the departments narrow minded view of the law has been selectively disemboweled from scattered judicial opinions and included in the guidance i can only repeat the word i used at the beginning to characterize the guidance dishonest i want to offer another comment on the intent of the justice department in issuing unsolicited guidance on fee waivers those who have followed the history of the foia know that the justice department has been pressing for restrictions on the law for 7 years if you listened to the department during this period changes to the seventh exemption covering law enforcement records were the highest priority some modest law enforcement changes were included in the freedom of information reform act there were minor problems and the congress made several adjustments in the act further we specifically provided that the law enforcement amendments would be effective upon enactment so that all law enforcement agencies could immediately begin to apply the new provisions in contrast the provisions of the foia pertaining to fees and fee waivers were not made effective until 6 months after the date of enactment despite its earlier claims that the foia was interfering with law enforcement operations the justice department has not offered any guidance to other agencies on the law enforcement provisions the department has ignored the law enforcement provisions as if they were unimportant and has shown no interest in assisting other agencies in implementing the law enforcement provision instead the department has spent its time and resources developing lengthy and erroneous advice on a minor feature of the amended foia the departments real priorities are exposed by the issuance of a memorandum designed to maximize the burden on those who seek fee waivers and to discourage other agencies from granting fee waivers to qualified requesters those who have carefully watched the justice departments foia activities over the last 7 years are not surprised to see the departments true colors exposed i would like to offer my own advice to federal agencies with regard to fee waivers pay no attention to the new justice department guidance the guidance is based on a misreading of the legislative history and is otherwise filled with errors i have written to the attorney general and asked that the guidance be withdrawn because of its mistakes and because of the departments contradictory position on its legislative history let there be no confusion about the congressional intent congress rewrote the foia fee waiver rules in order to make more people eligible for waivers this means that the press public interest groups schools libraries and other requesters should find it easier to qualify for fee waivers this change in the foia was an integral part of a package of amendments that included raising the fees for a narrowly defined class of commercial users of the foia both house and senate sponsors of the legislation clearly stated on the floor that everyone who qualified for a fee waiver under the old law will continue to quality under the new language some of those who failed to meet the old standard will qualify under the new whether the justice department likes it or not that is the intent of the amended foia the subcommittee on government information justice and agriculture which i chair will be conducting detailed oversight hearings on the implementation of the new foia amendments agency officials who deny fee waivers to qualified requesters will be personally invited to participate in the oversight process the justice department may defend an agencys illegal refusal to grant a fee waiver when it is challenged in court but the department will not be there to defend the responsible officials when they are called to testify before my subcommittee"], [0.0002665519714355469, 0.5002665519714355, 0, "the turkish prime minister turgut ozal has

have accomplished it in an effective manner that takes into account the needs of the affected industries and of the public needless to say this is frequently a difficult task the bill before us will accomplish a great deal it will ultimately provide the hearing impaired with the same access to nearly every telephone injoyed by the rest of the public that is and should be an important public

that i am concerned about the attitude which many people have developed toward credit the problem of individual debt burden in this country cannot be denied far too many people have accumulated debts so large that years may be needed to repay them it is only fair that consumers be thoroughly informed of all terms affecting the cost of using credit cards lenders spend a lot of money and expend great effort to convince people to use credit cards the proliferation of affinity cards is a perfect example of how creditors lure consumers into utilizing credit special logos on cards revards for making purchases and other such gimmicks are designed to entice people to charge more and more on their cards without warning from the creditor about the actual costs involved i do not deny that the use of credit can be very helpful and in some instances necessary to consumers however i firmly believe that individuals must be made aware of all aspects of a credit agreement for all the money spent by creditors to convince people to apply for affinity cards and the like some effort should be required on the part of the creditor to inform the consumer about terms which can drastically affect the cost of using credit cards h r 515 the fair credit card disclosure act addresses the need to disclose specific information about interest rates fees and other terms which apply to credit cards on applications and in telephone solicitations when the house considered h r 515 1 introduced an amendment which would have placed a floating cap on interest rates at a level 8 points above the yield on 1year treasury securities the rate would have been adjusted quarterly and if it were in effect today the maximum interest rate that could be charged on a credit card would be 15 40 percent i strongly believe that this amendment was in the best interest of the consumer and consumer groups from around the country agreed with me there is no reason other than greed on the part of the credit issuers that credit card interest rates should remain high when other interest rates fluctuate with trends in the economy while i believe that h r 515 does not pro tect the interests of the consumer as well as it could have i do believe that the bill has merit and should become law as quickly as possible the following article which appeared in the christian science monitor august 10 1988 aptly describes the need for disclosing the terms of credit cards i hope that when conferees are appointed to consider h r 515 they will keep these comments in mind and that my colleagues in the house will do the

the gentleman i have this problem in my own state of michigan a number of states particularly those states that are manufacturing states and are the more populous states have increasingly allowed stress claims under the worker compensation statutes mainly through court rulings and expansion of original workers compensation laws basically it allows a worker to secure disability compensation for stressrelated claims claims based on stress that was related to the workplace environment now seemingly that ought to be a permissible claim except ironically the courts increasingly as in the case of michigan have ruled that stress is to be determined not on the basis of any scientific measurement any physiological assessment that in fact a worker has suffered some illness that affects the heart rate blood pressure and so forth but simply the perception of stress on behalf of the employee one of the classic examples that we had in the state of michigan was a bank teller who successfully sued for workers compensation coverage in michigan in the following circumstances the teller had taken his voluntary retirement and was also getting a pension after the requisite number of years after his voluntary retirement from his position in the bank he was receiving a retirement benefit pension and he subsequently filed for workers compensation while getting the retirement on a voluntary leave from work or departure from the work force saying that he was used to handling large sums of money on a daily basis and suffered psychological strain and stress from the withdrawal of no longer being personally identified with counting large quantities of money we ought not to make fun of whatever agonies this person may or may not have experienced but the irony of the whole situation was that here we had a situation post retirement no 1 where it was a voluntary retirement and there was no medical evidence that in fact this person had changed in any way and yet simply by saying i feel a sense of stress and taking that under oath it then becomes compensable it is a very difficult point in workers compensation law"]]}
