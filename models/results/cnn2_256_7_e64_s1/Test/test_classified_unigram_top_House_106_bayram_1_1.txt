marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like

it will involve how much should the congress authorize to spend for this war in the balkans and as a previous speaker my colleague from indiana just said there are many of us not only here in congress but around the country that have serious concerns about this war what my colleague from indiana did not mention is history and there is an old expression and i think it is from montezuma who said that those who refuse to learn from history are doomed to repeat it let me give the members a ver y important history lesson that the germans learned in the 1940s in world war ii in world war ii the germans sent 400 000 troops into the balkans they suffered 70 000 casualties and at the end of the war they controlled less ground than the day that they marched in this is a war that i think we need to think long and hard before we get even more deeply involved but we had the debate last week on that and we had our votes we had a chance to vote this week though we are going to get a chance to vote on whether or not we should fund the war and then secondly if the republican leadership is successful in the committee on rules whether or not we should vote for even more funding than the president requested i want to talk a little bit about history as well because we are continually told that we have spread our military too thin and i agree with that the truth of the matter is we have spread our military too thin but i think the best analogy is an analogy of peanut butter and jelly we have spread our peanut butter and jelly entirely too thin but it is not because we are not giving our military enough money i want to talk a little bit about what is happening we have been told for example in the last several weeks that we are about 14 000 sailors short in terms of our navy but do my colleagues know what we are not short a single admiral we are not short any generals in fact as this chart indicates in 1945 when we had 12 1 million americans in uniform we had 31 generals above the rank of four star today we have 1 3 million americans in uniform and we have 33 generals so we may be short on army personnel we may be short on people in the navy but we are certainly not short on generals let me point out another chart and this is really for the benefit of my republican colleagues as my colleagues know just 4 years ago we passed a 7year balanced budget plan and in that

excellent bill and it deserves our immediate consideration and support i want to take particular note of the way in which this bill has been developed this bill comes to us by way of a remarkable bipartisan effort led by my good friend and colleague representative waxman and from the other side of the aisle representative coburn given the complexity of the ryan white program and the potentially controversial nature of the subject matter the fact that we will pass a good bill at this time of year with a strong bipartisan vote is a tribute to them our colleagues in the other body have also worked hard on this bill and are to be congratulated for their effort senators jeffords kennedy and frist have been solid partners in forging the legislation before us today the cdc estimates that more than 900 000 persons in america are now living with hiv approximately onethird of these persons know they are infected and are receiving treatment another third know they are infected but are not receiving treatment another third does not know they are infected another complication is that hiv infections are occurring in every region of the country and in every kind of situation underserved areas such as rural areas arehaving a particularly difficult time because they lack the infrastructure of proven prevention and treatmentprograms in brief s 2311 keeps those programs that have withstood the test of time just as significantly it makes changes where they were needed the four titles of the ryan white care act contain a variety of grants and formulas that distribute funds at the state and local levels as we all know changing programs of this kind is never easy in this case we have successfully blended the need for change with the need for continuity of care for those areas that have been especially hard hit by the hiv aids epidemic on this point let me note the great work of our colleagues representatives eshoo towns and pelosi i note also that a listing of all of the changes made to the ryan white program by this bill is setforth in the statement of managers that will be included in the record of todays proceedings finally i wish to

is here who are all taking active time out to speak we are here this evening because we care about our young people we are here because we recognize that may has been designated as teenage pregnancy month we are here to acknowledge the success of efforts that have been made as a result of communities working together and a variety of communities doing different things pulling together parents schools communities churches understanding that there are no easy answers to teenage pregnancy but understanding that it is a serious problem that indeed deserves our concentration and a concentrated effort on the part of all of us abstinence certainly is the main program that we advocate and feel that it is one sure method that young people can be assured of if indeed they have that and practice that abstinence certainly would not only reduce and prevent teenage pregnancy but it also will reduce and prevent many of the transmitted disease as they relate to being sexually active none more drastically than the spread of aids which takes too many lives however abstinence alone will not do it because too many young people obviously are involved so we also advocate that there should be planned parenthood there should be contraceptives there should be a variety of educational counseling health clinics there should be the community the church faithbased activities that encourage young peoples development we believe that if young people have a strategy for the future and have hope about their career and have economic security they are more likely to be about developing themselves rather than getting involved in behavior that is selfdestructive including premature sex once a young person is pregnant there are no good choices indeed we know because there is research that shows without a doubt teenage pregnancy not only brings stress to the teenage mother or the teenage father and their family and the young person that is born but also it is costly to society research has shown that a teenaged daughter giving birth to a daughter that daughter grows up and is 83 percent more likely to be a teenage mother herself a son who is given birth by a teenage mother that young man has a likelihood 2 7 times greater to get in trouble and to either have as his hope for the future going to prison or death those are not statistics that we can look and think that this is an easy answer by saying that that is just one approach several approaches must be used this is a serious problem because we think that teenage destructive behavior eventually is a continuum whether it is getting involved with premature sexual activities or involved in drugs or involved in crime all of the things that do not allow that young person to be the person that he or she has the potential of being and making a contribution society loses not only through the costs to imprison that young man or the costs for sexual disease and transmission of those diseases but the loss of the contribution that those young people could make is even more severe so we are here tonight to tell young people and adults that this is a serious problem we are here to reinforce their value to us and how we care about them i just want to mention things that we do in our district we have now had several forums this year alone we have had two we had one last saturday where we had more than 50 young people and adults to come we had ministers we had counselors we had health professionals we had young people who were engaged with other young people they had a teen summit where they talked to each other it is surprising what teenagers say to themselves and to each other they indeed can give some of the best wisdom i urge all of our colleagues to engage themselves with young people again i want to thank all

am going to offer later which attempts to correct what i think is a difficulty with the fatherhood section and the debate seems to have been exclusively on that portion of the bill i think we should really be spending time on the portion that has to do with welfaretowork which is an extremely important amendment that has been put together with this bill which is referred to as the fathers count legislation beginning on title ill of this legislation welfare to work program eligibility which was reported out favorably by the committee on education and the workforce is a bill which attempts to correct a very serious problem with the original welfare reform legislation in that legislation we attempted to be so strict in defining the eligibility of people who could qualify for welfaretowork and in setting up the requirements virtually eliminated 90 percent of the people who might otherwise have been able to participate i say that very liberally because in talking to the department of labor that administers this program they are saying that only about 10 percent of the funds have been utilized looking at the figures programs in may and june of this year they are saying that hopefully it has risen to about 13 to 15 percent which suggests to me that this legislation which we reported out of the committee on education and the workforce is an absolutely essential correction in my own state and i have talked to the people there and they say the one thing that eliminates almost all of the custodial parents from participating is the restriction that says you must not have a high school diploma or a ged and almost all of the people on welfare or the parents on welfare have their high school diplomas in my state and so they are automatically disqualified so this correction which we are making eliminating these very strict requirements is essential if we expect to take this welfaretowork opportunity to the people that really need it the second point i want to make is that the current law even the current law which has all of these defects opens up opportunity for welfaretowork opportunities and assistance and other kinds of programs to both custodial parents and noncustodial parents it is opened up completely to both aspects in fact to make sure that the noncustodial parent has an opportunity there were restrictions of funding 70 percent in one area 30percent

sure that was not my family that was traveling down the highway spending their kids inheritance i think it points up really a more serious issue and that is it really in some cases and my colleague pointed out some very reallife examples in some cases it is cheaper to sell off the family business predeath rather than to experience first of all the personal tragedy of the loss of a loved one but then having to deal with the internal revenue service at the moment of death the best bumper sticker slogan that i can think of regarding this issue is as follows the death of a family member should not be a taxable event the point is and i know that the editorials talk about and my colleague has spoken very eloquently and very passionately about the opponents of this repeal say well this is only going to help as you my colleague mentioned the bill gateses or the wealthy class but the wealthiest americans i think what gets lost in all of the debate is how many resources how much money is spent

lucy and they worked very hard during the course of their lifetimes and their two sons brad and greg who now are the principals in that lumber business and it has been successful people around the midmissouri area recognize this lumber company howard is now enjoying retirement and he is becoming more seasoned as a mature american and yet the amount of money that the eiffert family particularly the two principals are spending 35 000 a year on insurance premiums and the sole purpose of purchasing that insurance policy is to have something in place so that when the inevitable mortality occurs that they will have proceeds from which they cail then pay the federal death tax that is 35 000 a year of capital that they could be investing in their business investing in their families putting

budget as we have heard tonight has six key features and i want to take a moment to talk about one of them which is tax relief for hardworking americans when we talk about federal taxes it is useful to consider the overall context of the federal budket here let us remember federal spending is higher than it has ever been federal taxes are higher than any peacetime in our nations history as we heard earlier about 21 percent of our entire economic output goes to the federal government what the republican budget does is it says after we set aside all of the social security funds for social security and to retire debt and after we pay down 1 trillion in debt over the next 5 years and after we set aside 40 billion of additional funding for medicare over the next 5 years and after rebuilding our national defense and reprioritizing funding for elementary and secondary education after all of that there is still an unprecedented surplus projected as far as the eye can see when taxpayers are paying more money than it takes to fund all of that then it is obvious to me that taxes are just too high so the republican budget offers a modest but a meaningful measure of tax relief and tax fairness we need to lower taxes and restore to working americans some more of their freedom to decide how they want to spend their pwn money our colleagues with this amendment are offering a tiny little merely symbolic but not a real meaningful tax cut it is just not enough let us remember when the federal government takes peoples money away from them it is taking part of their freedom away this is money that the government takes from hardworking americans that they will never be free to spend for themselves as they see fit it is money that takes time to earn and that means time taken away that folks could spend doing other things like maybe spending more time with their children maybe caring for an elderly family member maybe volunteering in their community or just enjoying some leisure time at a time of already huge government spending record high federal taxes it is unconscionable at this point not to provide the american people with the opportunity to keep a little bit more of the money that they earn the republican budget strikes the right balance no more raiding of the social security surplus for the second consecutive year funding americas priorities like national defense and education retiring a trillion dollars of debt over 5 years in tax relief for an overtaxed nation i urge my colleagues to reject this amendment with its puny little tax cut and
