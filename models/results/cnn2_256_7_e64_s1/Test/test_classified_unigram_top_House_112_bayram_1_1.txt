that it is unable to be responsible with their money the arguments against a balanced budget amendment appear to rest on the concerns that this will finally stop outofcontrol spending meaning congress will no longer be able to spend at will on programs that may be nice to have but are unnecessary or unaffordable the measure on the floor today is a good compromise between those who wanted a stronger

7 trillion cigarettes sold globally each year here in the united states approximately 4 billion cigarettes sold each year are illicit cigarette smuggling is typically carried out by sophisticated largescale criminal organizations that take advantage of the significant disparity between the taxes levied on cigarettes across the states for example a pack of cigarettes that costs 13 in a hightax state like new york will cost only about 5 in a lowtax state such as virginia these differences create a highly lucrative market for individuals to evade the local sales tax and purchase cigarettes in one locality and transport them to another for resale below the market value criminal organizations are able to make a profit of as much as 1 million on just a single truckload of illicit cigarettes state cigarette taxes in the united states have been on the rise since 1992 and have increased more than 65 percent over this period however the states gross tax revenues have increased by only 35 percent due in significant part to the illicit tobacco trade exploiting the price disparity for a single pack of cigarettes between individual states has proved profitable for criminal networks according to the justice department this illicit activity costs the states and the federal government approximately 5 billion each year this is money that couldand shouldbe put to better use congress

ignoring real solutions choosing instead to use our economic struggles as an excuse to push partisan and ideological legislation the american people deserve jobs now rather than bills aimed only at stoking the rhetorical fires and antagonizing political opponents its time to stop the games and seek compromise for the betterment of our nation a middle class tax increase is looming with the extension of the payroll tax many middle class families earning 70 000 to 80 000 a year will be forced to pay over a 1 000 a year more in taxes apparently the republicans believe that the government knows how to spend their money better than american families as a businessman and an entrepreneur im proud to have created many jobs and many businesses i meet with the businesses in my district on a regular basis not a single business has raised this issue as any kind of impediment to job growth any kind of impediment to getting the economy growing again this is simply a nonrelated subject that pursues a longtime agenda to destroy the ability of workers to organize this bill represents the ohioization of america just as republicans attempted in the state of ohio house republicans are simply union busting but we saw what happened in ohio where ohioans across the ideological spectrum overwhelmingly said no to this kind of antiworker agenda and the american people reject it as well this bills singular goal is to shut down workplace elections it would overturn the proposed national labor relations board rule it would modernize the union election process and avoid delays but instead of creating efficiency in government the workplace election prevention actually mandates inefficiency it makes inefficiency the norm rather than the exception the bill puts in place 35day delays in holding elections after filing petitions the bill includes no limit on how long the elections can be delayed in the case of workplace elections delay is a critical issue the intent of delaying an election is to give antiunion employers a chance to prevent workers from organizing despite republicans professed outrage over frivolous lawsuits and tort reform and many other areas h r 3094 incentivizes a mountain of litigation for the sole purpose of stalling workplace elections this creates a massive backlog of cases including frivolous ones all on the taxpayers dime republicans dont seem to have a problem with trial lawyers as long as theyre suing unions this bill even allows managers to stuff the ballot boxes of employer elections now im sure many of us in this body here are following our state redistricting processes to see how various districts across the country are gerrymandered what this bill would allow employers to do is effectively gerrymander what the negotiating unit is at the company if theres a group of employees thats interested in forming a union it would give the employer the ability to say no thats actually not a valid group it needs to include this other group or this other group and decide on what the electoral body is what is the electorate choosing their own electorate as too many members of congress attempt to do through the redistricting process choosing their electorate to try to rig the election against the workers this bill is just the latest assault on workers rights and its again typical of this donothing congress the republicans have been fixated on attacking the national labor relations board the board that is in place to strike a balance between labor and employers by cutting the agencys funding by holding up new appointments and now by reversing a rule on noticeposting to inform employees of their rights the people are wise to see whats going on here in congress every week were in session we see a parade of special interest bills paraded on the house floor while taxes for middle class families risk going up because the republicans believe that government knows how to spend their money better than the american people the big energy companies have got numerous exemptions from the clean air and clean water acts the rest of us got pollution asthma and other illness look is it possible to create jobs by lowering standards it is if you want to remove workplace safety standards you can create jobs unsafe jobs if you want to reduce the minimum wage to 2 an hour you can create jobs 2anhour jobs is

because i will be wrapping up shortly i rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary of la roche college founded in 1963 by the sisters of divine providence in mccandless pennsylvania a suburb of pittsburgh it was named in honor of marie de la roche the first superior of the congregation of the sisters of divine providence originally a college for religious sisters it now educates a diverse group of students from around the world offering highquality educational opportunities that continue to reflect its catholic heritage soon after its founding la roche experienced financial difficulties that threatened the schools existence due to the financial strain the congregation at that time seriously considered permanently closing the college however because of the profound and positive impact the school made on the community in the short time its doors had been opened the students state officials and the community leaders urged the congregation and the schools leadership to continue the mission of the school and to keep the school open thankfully due to the outpouring of support from the community in 1970 the board amended its charter to establish la roche college as an independent coeducational catholic institution which it remains today it also joined with the art institute of pittsburgh and diversified its course offerings expanding the areas of study the college would offer including graphic and interior design programs that are among la roche colleges most popular programs today i was proud to serve on the board of trustees at la roche college it was during my time as a trustee that i had the wonderful opportunity to get to know the late monsignor william kerr who served as la roches president for 12 years it was during his tenure that the college established the pacem in terris institute a scholarship program for outstanding collegeage men and women from conflict and postconflict nations such as rwanda and bosnia the institute allows students to receive an education at la roche college to study leadership and diplomacy in return for their agreement to return to their home country after graduation to help engage in the peace process and rebuild their nations the institute successfully reflects the colleges vision and mission to foster global citizenship that program over the years has created a bond with some countries that is unlike any other institution of higher learning in america it has had students go through the program that have gone back to their home countries and have very successfully become leaders in those countries we are better off as a nation and as a global community because of their work and because of that program which initiated and continues at la roche college it was also during my time on the board of trustees in 2004 that la roche college board of trustees appointed sister candace introcaso as the colleges seventh president sister candace began her career in education at la roche in the late 1980s and its under her leadership that the college has continued to expand its global footprint while placing a renewed focus on serving the needs of those in the pittsburgh region i had the privilege of working closely with sister candace during my time as a trustee and as the congressman who now represents la roche college the future is bright for the college under her continued leadership la roche college improves upon itself year after year it continues to expand its academic offerings with more than 50 undergraduate majors 20 undergraduate minors and three graduate programs for six consecutive years it has been named one of the best northeastern colleges by the princeton review and it fields 12 intercollegiate teams on many occasions my office used their facilities for workshops and town hall meetings over the years la roche students and faculty as well as sister candace came to visit my office on a number of occasions to discuss the importance of education to our country and

the jobs bill has been passed we passed the free trade agreement we passed the veterans benefit portion we passed the 3 percent withholding so there has been movement in a bipartisan manner on some provisions in the bill so now let me segue to an issue for which ive come to the floor now six times that of going throughout the country and highlighting where highlevel nuclear waste is stored throughout this country today well travel to the state of massachusetts right on cape cod bay where the pilgrim nuclear power plant sits again its right on cape cod bay at pilgrim there are over 2 918 spentfuel assemblies on site yucca mountain which is the defined storage location by law in the 1982 nuclear waste policy act currently has no nuclear waste on site i like to keep highlighting the real distinct differences based upon the years of talking about this issue and highlighting some of the arguments against yucca comparing it to where we have nuclear waste today so lets again continue to look at the pilgrim nuclear power plant the waste is stored aboveground in pools very similar to fukushimadiachi in japan at yucca the waste will be stored 1 000 feet undergroundabove the ground in pools 1 000 feet underground i think yucca is a better location at pilgrim the waste is 20 feet from the water table at yucca it would be 1 000 feet above the water table i think thats a better safer and more secure location you can see the pilgrim plant is right on cape cod bay right next to the water yucca mountain is situated 100 miles from really the nearest body of water which would be the colorado river now for those who have been following my time in coming to the floor this is my sixth time i started at hanford a doe facility in washington state and compared it to yucca mountain i then went to zion ive got my friend from chicago right here zion is right on lake michigan which is a decommissioned nuclear power plant that still has waste stored on site but wisconsin has two nuclear power plants right on lake michigan then i went to savannah georgia to talk about the nuclear waste there of course it has the savannah river so its right next to the savannah river then i went out to california to look at san onofre the nuclear power plant thats right on the pacific ocean then i went to idaho and looked at the idaho national labs and the nuclear waste stored there today we go to massachusetts the point being there is highlevel nuclear waste stored all over this country and a single repository at yucca mountain makes sense for all of the right reasons its over 100 miles from the largest city its in the desert it would be underneath a mountain there is no more safe secure location why are we not moving forward because this administration has decided not to spend the money needed to finish the final environmental study through the nuclear regulatory commission so where are our senators on this position ive been bringing this down to the floor through all these states we need 60 votes in the senate to secure americas nuclear waste right now through the states based upon the states weve identified there are 20 yeses weve got about seven who are relatively new we dont know their positions of course we have established five who are noes there are some in the new england states that i mentioned susan collins voted for yucca mountain in 2002 olympia snowe voted for it in 2002 senator kerry voted against it now pilgrim is in the state of massachusetts based upon his statement i guess senator kerry feels that pilgrim is a more safe and
