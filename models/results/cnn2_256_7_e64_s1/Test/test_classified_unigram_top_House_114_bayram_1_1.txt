to bed hungry at night so i thank the gentleman very much for his leadership let me just say to mr scott who is our ranking member it is very important that we recognize the gentlemans leadership and know that he is on this committee fighting each and every day to make sure that this reauthorization bill which would take food out of mouths of american schoolchildren does not do that so i thank the gentleman for his fight on the committee let me say just a couple of things with regard to h r 5003 it would turn the clock back on years of progress and prevent children from eating healthy meals every day this republican child nutrition bill would roll back critical evidencebased nutrition standards made in the 2010 reauthorization bill which we were very actively involved with sadly but unsurprisingly it would also deny eligible children access to the free or reduced price school meals program and it would slash funding for some electronics benefits transfer 1915 i just have to say that as a young single mother on public assistance and food stamps i dont know what i would have done had my children not had school lunches this was a bridge over troubled waters for me and my children and i have to thank my government for that helping hand but today in 2016 this bill will roll back these programs which means more hungry kids in our schools and in our neighborhoods that is

aisle signs this important letter and i hope that the majority will read it carefully it lays out some of the basic problems in this bill we want to make sure that everyone on the committee and this entire body understands the impact of what this will cause when we take away access to these meals we jeopardize childrens health their educational attainment and really their future we know that children who have access to healthy meals are more likely to do well in school have decreased behavioral problems and come to class ready to learn that is what we should want for all of our children for the children growing up in highpoverty neighborhoods and who lack equal access to healthy meals these school meals really are a lifeline we are not just talking about a few students the numbers are clear more than 15 3 million children are living in foodinsecure households let me say that again more than 15 million kids are at risk of going to bed hungry every night in america the richest and most powerful country in the world we also know that childhood hunger is far from colorblind children of color are disproportionately affected by hunger every day for example in 2014 one in three african american children and one in four latino children were food insecure for children who live in rural communities food insecurity is coupled with other barriers like lack of access to transportation to get to summer feeding sites more than 17 percent of rural householdsthat is 3 3 million householdsare food insecure child hunger and the lack of nutritious food is a problem that affects every child in every zip code it is endemic in our country in rural urban and suburban schools every member of congress has constituents who are hungry this should be a priority for all of us i have seen the impact of food insecurity in my own community in oakland california where one in four children at the oakland unified school district do not have access to affordable nutritious food these families are forced to make impossible choices to feed their children especially during the summer months when schools are closed these families are making decisions every day between food and medicine food and rent or food and paying the electric bill we need real solutions to these very real problems let me just mention my legislation the half in ten act h r 258 that would develop a national strategy to cut poverty in half over the next decade that is more than 23 million americans lifted out of poverty and into the middle class in just the next 10 years this bill that we are talking about tonight goes just the opposite way surely we can all recognize that ensuring healthy meals for american children is the first step in this ongoing war on poverty it should not be a partisan issue feeding hungry kids is a moral imperative so lets put our children first and lets strengthen our child nutrition programs rather than cut them our children deserve the security of

rise to speak in support of the democratic motion to recommit that would protect the civil rights of students at schools that receive vouchers by requiring the schools to certify that they provide each student with all applicable civil rights protections the d c voucher program calls into question multiple federal civil rights protections and turns a blind eye to the governmentfunded discrimination for example religious schools that accept vouchers are permitted to discriminate on the basis of religion in hiring a violation of traditional principles prohibiting discrimination based on religion when using federal money the fact is that most religious schools are part of a ministry of the sponsoring church and these schools either cannot or will not separate the religious content from their academic programs so it is impossible to prevent a publicly funded voucher program for paying for these institutions religious activities and education furthermore schools that accept vouchers are allowed to discriminate based on gender in admissions a violation of the principles of title ix in addition to the discrimination based on religion or sex the d c voucher program also raises serious concerns about the civil rights of students with disabilities idea requires that schools that receive federal idea funds provide appropriate education to all students with disabilities but at least one study found that the schools that accept d c vouchers serve students with disabilities at a much lower rate than public schools failing to meet the needs of students with disabilities is just one of the shortcomings of the d c voucher program but another issue is the performance of the school a 2010 department of education report concluded that the use of a voucher had no statistically significant impact on overall student achievement in math or reading additional studies found that students from schools in need of improvement have shown no improvement in math or reading due to the voucher program furthermore participating in the voucher program had no impact on student safety satisfaction motivation or engagement many of those who actually won a voucher cannot use them because the voucher does not cover the full cost of attending a private or religious school as a result many who win a voucher find that they cannot use it because they cant afford the remaining cost of the education so studies have confirmed that fewer than 25 percent of the students who use the vouchers are from schools that were in need of improvement the d c voucher program fails on all counts it violates principles of traditional civil rights laws it makes no improvement on student achievement and it fails to reach the very children it was designed to help our public schools need more funding not less rather than funnel taxpayer funding to private or religious schools that lack civil rights protections and fail to meet the goals of helping the right students we

protecting children born alive its real intent is to further undermine a womans right to choose a right that has been constitutionally guaranteed for more than 42 years by roe v wade not only does this bill attempt to politicize womens health and to limit womens access to abortion it would interfere with the sacred doctorpatient relationship and substitute a physicians best judgment with the judgment of a handful of politicians we must not forget that this bill has come to the floor at the same time as the push to defund planned parenthood this attack on a venerable and respected provider of highquality health care would have a devastating impact on women especially women in rural communities lowincome women and women of color and it would deny women access to preventive care lifesaving cancer screenings and family planning services approximately one woman in five has relied on planned parenthood for health care at some point in her lifetime it is a blatant attack on women and families to defund an organization that uses federal funds to prevent abortions and to help families stay healthy and cannot even use federal funding for abortion it would be the saddest of ironies that by defunding planned parenthoods critical contraception and other reproductive health services in the name of opposing abortion we would see more unintended pregnancies and therefore more abortions among its flaws h r 3504 proposes a standard of care for abortion providers that could interfere with the ability of physicians to make medical decisions for their patients in doing so the bill represents an unprecedented level of intrusion by the government into medical decisions for instance the bill requires an abortion provider to immediately transport a fetus to a hospital in some cases even if the fetus is not viable under existing law and under the standards of care applicable to neonatal physicians this requirement is so broad and the penalties so severeup to 5 years in prisonthat one can only conclude that the real purpose of the bill is to intimidate abortion providers out of service the bill also requires doctors and employees of hospitals and clinics that provide abortion services to report any violations of the bills standard of care to state or federal law enforcement authorities any person who fails to comply with these requirements is threatened with fines and up to 5 years in prison this is not just the doctors but the cleaning crew and the receptionists on top of this the language in this bill completely fails to distinguish between a viable and nonviable fetus which is the constitutional line that separates abortions that may be performed without restrictions from those that may be regulated or prohibited the bills vague and broad mandates combined with severe penalties will effectively intimidate doctors and ultimately drive them away from the abortion practice which appears to be the true intent of this troubling bill this is why so many organizations are opposed to this bill those like the national womens law center the aauw the aclu and physicians for reproductive choice and health in fact the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists which represents 58 000 physicians opposes h r 3504 because it represents a gross interference in the practice of medicine inserting a politician between a woman and her doctor by intimidating doctors and thereby making abortion unavailable as a practical matter abortion opponents seek to accomplish in fact what they have not accomplished in the courts or in public opinion simply put h r 3504 is yet another attack on womens health and rights when the bornalive infant protection act or baipa became law 13 years ago the bills sponsors clarified that the law was not intended to affect abortion practice or a womans right to choose we did not want to constrain or chill medical decisions regarding patient care that is why judiciary committee democrats voted to support it the bill before us today appears to directly contradict those assurances lets not forget that politicians are not doctors we should be concerned about doing our jobs and fully funding

want to touch on a couple of very specific issues that have been mentioned by my friend from maryland and others on the other side of the aisle our balanced budget proposal gets to balance within a 10year period of time it does so without raising taxes and it increases growth now the growth is important and our friends mentioned it on the other side of the aisle as if the policies that have been in place over the past 6 years had some magical solution that they increased growth in this country well the fact of the matter is that as we see it in this chartthis is from the congressional budget office the nonpartisan congressional budget office as my friend from maryland says these are the projections of growth that the congressional budget office has had over the last 4 years four years ago 3 0 percent the average as you all well know is about 3 3 percent over the last 40 years growth in this country that is in the economy growing every year 3 3 percent on average and the projection 4 years ago was that it would be 3 percent three years ago it was down to 2 9 percent 2 years ago 2 5 percent this year 2 3 percent this is lost jobs lost opportunity fewer dreams realized all because of the policies coming out of washington d c and our friends on the other side want to double down on those policies our proposal our budget that gets to balancewhich our friends on the other side of the aisle and their budget never does the presidents budget never gets to balance something that folks back home cant do they cant do it in their personal lives they cant do it in their businesses our budget gets to balance and increases growthincreases growthbecause that is what we have got to do we have got to increase growth in this economy so that more dreams can be realized more jobs can be created wages can be increased the way you increase wages is to increase the vitality of the economy not have washington dictate it to people and then this tired old characterization of our proposal to save and strengthen and secure medicare and the way that it is characterized is to voucherize it well this is nonsense and the american people know it what we propose to do is to save medicare not allow it to die on the vine which is what our friends on the other side of the aisle apparently want to do because when you read their policies they dont do anything to address the insolvency of medicare that is coming in a very short period of timenot according to me but according to the medicare trusteesand what that means is that patients seniors wont be able to get provided the services that they have been promised that is not the right thing to do our friends on the other side talk about all the tax loopholes and goodness knows we have been for cutting tax loopholes and closing tax loopholes before closing tax loopholes was cool we just cant get out and get folks to rally to the cause in a positive way from our friends on the other side of the aisle my friend from maryland knows that the way that that is fashioned is in the ways and means committee it is not in the budget committee the budget committee lays out the vision lays out the plan lays out the parameters that are able to be utilized as my friend from maryland knows the ways and means committee is actively working right nowactively working right nowon appropriate tax reform it was the tax reform proposal that was put forward by our side of the aisle last year that demonstrated our willingness and desire to close loopholes and to end special treatments through the tax code we believe everybody ought to be

where healthcare costs are going right now healthcare costs are down that is right who are they down for they are down for the federal government who are they not down for the american people that is who they are not down for what we have done with the presidents healthcare program is to shift huge costshuge coststo the american people if you are an individual out there you make 30 000 40 000 50

finance my way through arizona state university at night she in her retirement at that age decided to take on another job at our little office she sat me down and she knew i had an interest in conservative politics i still to this day remember her looking at me and saying david i like you you are going to be the next president of the local republican club i tried to explain to her there was no way i would have time for such a thing and she looked at me and said dont worry i will help this is a woman who moved to our little community on the side of scottsdale i believe in the late seventies and had such an impact for years i used to believe maybe a third of the townhalf the townhad become involved in politics mostly republican politics because of her passion her energy you could not stop her she got me to be president of the local club and stood by me when i did dumb things and applauded me when i did good things and scolded me when i didnt say the right things and walked me through how to be more sensitive instead of being so caffeinated which is a family problem i realized in the chaos of doing this job that i failed to tell her how much i loved her and how much she affected my life because i dont believe i would be here today if it werent for elanor benson who not only changed my life but who actually i believewith her work at the fountain hill chamber of commerce her work for so many causes her work for her churchmade my community a much much better place we are all better in our part of arizona because of her life it was a life well lived it was a

an interesting thing is happening on this floor as i sit around and listen i am hearing republicans and democrats on the same side those that are opposed to it are bipartisan those that support this all come from one place you know when i came to congress the one thing you are always told is find a committee and stick with that committee because what happens is you get expertise if you care about banking you go to financial services and you get expertise year over year taxes ways and means when it comes to foreign affairs you get the expertise of something like this so you know what i have listened to those who sit on those committees and i look to the chairman and the ranking member on the democratic side you know what i heard from both of them they are in the same position they are opposed to this agreement they took their years of expertise they read through it they did the hearings and they came to the same conclusion so i wonder could that happen on the other side of this

will abide by the agreement why because they never have before 1l 1000 iran has a history of not living up to their promises it is clear today that what the president said he did not achieve just in april president obama said he will do what is necessary to prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon he said that he will implement this deal to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon he did the opposite in 13 years iran can have a nuclear weapon not just because iran wants it but america will say then it is okay thirteen years is not that far away that is not all that iran gets in this deal while we had sanctions on iran the only reason they wanted to come to the tablewhat did they do with their money even though it was scarce they didnt have much they funded terrorism around the world what does this deal do it gives them as much or maybe even more than the bailout that greece got what will iran become they will become the central bank of terror in the world that is what we are voting on today if you want to know the truth about the deal you go even further because there are side secret agreements we do not know on this side of the aisle we think we should keep with the law we think when 400 people on this floor voted for the corkercardin bill that said you had to have all agreements we felt when there were 98 senators and only one opposed that you would want to hold to the same agreement why would anybody want to vote on something without having all the facts especially after you read the reports that maybe iran can do selfinspection if that is the case why dont we bring to the floor and change the olympic committee and those athletes should be able to test themselves i look for the education committee maybe students should grade themselves maybe that is facetious but this is probably the most important bill you will vote on in your term in congress dont fall to political pressure because you dont need to the bipartisanship of the majority of americans stands opposed the expertise in this house that you respect regardless of what party you are in because you selected those members to lead those committees are opposed if that is not enough

they trained in military style they slept on metal cots like everybody else and marched and lived under military discipline that is why we feel they deserve the full honors that we give our war heroes

thought it was the nastiest thing that they speaking of the army air forces officials could have done to us this was while she was receiving visitors at her home in coronado they fired us they gave our jobs to air force men who didnt want to go overseas i would have gone overseas in a minute she said i was a heck of a good fighter pilot in my community of san diego in el cajon i also have a

was also one of the 1 102 women who flew in the allvolunteer program between 1942 and 1944 she remarked all of us felt bad to lose our flying jobs all of us wanted to keep up our ability to fly because they knew that with prevailing chauvinistic attitudes there would be no pilots work for them in the civilian realm we need to be sure that we dont lose our perspective about the work that these women did and that we honor them in this way that we honor them and their families who supported them as well because we know with all of our military families it is not just the person who serves but it is the entire family who serves as well that was certainly true of these wasps whose family members worried about them and were concerned about them as they carried on with their duties

becoming harmful or deadly here is another point that has been written by amethyst lees first off the health system is horrible and i worked inside a mental institution and saw firsthand what it is like depending on where i was the people were not getting their needs met or were being ignored i even saw an incident where a man was waiting for 15 minutes for two staff members to stop talking about football just to ask for some ice he never got his ice because he lashed out for being ignored and of course he was restrained in a chair for an hour for getting angry marianne kernan writes with regard to cody miller talk to him our mental health system is shameful i know as i work daily with this population many times their treatment is inhumane some with dementia or alzheimers wouldnt be treated this way if they had a break with reality it is a sad commentary on our lack of knowledge of dealing with serious mental illness here are some more stories angie geyser writes my 13yearold daughter morgan was in police custody for 19 months before she finally received treatment for her schizophrenia we had to pursue a civil commitment to make it happen now she is back in juvenile detention where she has no access to the outdoors and is not allowed to have physical contact with her family the treatment of the seriously mentally ill by the criminal justice system is appallingly inhumane frede trenkle writes two weeks ago a stranger that i have been married to for 13 years came into my home sprayed me with pepper spray took a knife out in front of my two kids and threatened to cut his throat the police took him away and put him in a mental health hold i chose not to press charges and just requested that he get help this was his second hospital stay in a month the hold was supposed to be for 7 days four days later he got out and i am sure because he had a plane ticket out of the state he convinced someone out there that i was the threat he denied ever having a knife he manipulated the system i received abusive texts before i changed my phone number and he sent terrible emails i only wish he could get the help he desperately needs wherever he is but because of the unchecked mental illness i now have two beautiful girls without their father and both needing their own mental health counseling how do we help our system on all ends another woman writes if you want people like this young man to get help we all need to be okay with paying more taxes and closing privatized prisons the prison system has become the dumping ground for the pervasive mentally ill another one writes my uncle has schizophrenia he disappears for months at a time i worry constantly about him being hurt by law enforcement he was living 50 miles away in the woods on his fathers property in a camper and was threatened with a gun by a neighbor because he was walking in the fields talking to things only he can see the cops were called and they showed up with weapons drawn then they took him away and locked him up for a month he is only 32 but the police assumed he was on drugs he was having a psychotic episode there is not enough education in the judicial system about mental illness and innocent people are being killed through the ignorance another woman writes my question is this as the mom where should we direct the young people with schizophrenia hospital care is effective but it seems to be temporary 6 months in and 2 years out repeat has anyone found or used or heard of any successful treatment going on at treatment facilities the answer is yes actually one of the programs in h r 2646 the helping families in mental health crisis act is for something called raise recovery after an initial schizophrenia episode we have learned that since schizophrenia and bipolar illness and severe mental illnesses are emerging in adolescent and young adult years if one gets to someone early with a low dose of medication with proper evidencebased treatment the prognosis is much much better but when we dont treat someone every time someone has what the lay public calls a nervous breakdown or a psychotic breaka crisiswe have to understand that over time these lead to neurological damage these are not harmless episodes this is not just someone who gets upset this is a real psychiatric disorder that comes from the brain and leads to problems and that is why we see these problems grow here is someone who doesnt quite understand the problem a woman by the name of julie writes i am very much against the families of mentally ill patients having the power to put their loved ones away against a patients will let the doctors determine if the patient has a problem not the family often the family just doesnt want to deal with the illness so they want the person to go away someone by the name of robin duffey writes julie you dont know what youre talking about there are more of us that do care but because of the mental health laws we are unable to make decisions for very sick family members people with schizophrenia dont realize they are sick they think their hallucinations are real along with the commanding voices they hear so how can such an ill person make a logical decision to get the help they need the answer is they cant the doctors have to follow the laws that are in place which is they cannot recommend committing a person unless they are an immediate threat or danger to someone or themselves yes julie there are some families that dont want to be bothered but i was not one of them i highly recommend you to do research on the subject before you spout your ideas read the federal and state laws indeed that is what we are trying to do with h r 2646 there are a couple of thousand more comments on my facebook page and i certainly ask people to go and read them they are heartbreaking they are horrifying they are tragic they are true they go on and on because our nation refuses to acknowledge this until we pass this bill and start making changeswe can predict itin the time that i have been speaking here there have been several more suicides there have been more homicides there have been more mentally ill people whom we have abandoned there have been people who have had chronic illnesses and who have died because the people with serious mental illness for multiple reasons tend to die 10 to 25 years sooner than the rest of the population because of the fact that 75 percent of those with mental illness have at least one chronic illness 50 percent have at least two chronic illnesses and a third have at least three chronic illnesses i mean things like heart disease lung disease infectious disease diabetes they get sick and they oftentimes are not treated many times they dont seek treatment we let them go in this slowmotion death spiral and ignore them we have closed the hospitals we have put them in prisons if they are out of control and if the police bring them to the emergency room and if there are no beds available they tie them down to the gurney where they may wait for daysor weeks in some caseswhere they are perhaps given some sedativea chemical straightjacket if you willto calm them down that is not treatment that is abusive that is our nation that is doing it and congress is culpable in this because we refuse to act once again there will be a tragedy somewhere i shudder to thinkand i hope it is not anybody here who is injuredthat somewhere out in america today this is going to happen once again we will gather for a moment of silence the gavel will come down and we will go back to our regular order of business it is sad and it disgusts me but that is what we face all of this closing of hospitals and not opening up community mental health medicaids saying you cant see two doctors in the same day medicaids saying you cant go to a hospital with more than 16 beds hhs saying we cant tell parents anything so they are left in the dark the substance abuse and mental health services administration which funds programs that teach people to make collages to do interpretive dances to get off their medication to make masks and other things that have nothing to do with serious mental illness we need to change the system and that is what h r 2646 does it takes that office of samhsa and changes it so that the director of it is the assistant secretary of mental health and substance abuse that person needs to be a doctor or a psychiatrist who is trained either an m d or an osteopath or a psychologist but someone who understands the field and not just someone who is saying well lets just do these other feel good programs the city of new york just did this too where the mayor put up hundreds of millions of dollars for programs that were supposedly for the mentally ill they werent for the mentally ill at all they were programs like parks and bike trails and feel good programs to help people with sadness not to deal with depression and serious mental illness how long can we continue to fool ourselves as for this whole idea that says leave it up to them if they want to choose dont provide them the help make it the most difficult for those people who have the most difficulty all of this is more commentary and evidence of the grand experiment of stopping all treatment under the misguided selfcentered and projected belief that all people who are mentally ill are fully capable of deciding their own fate and direction regardless of their deficits and disease and that they have the right to selfdecay and selfdestruction which overrides their right to be healthy the most fundamental dangerous and destructive hidden undercurrent of prejudice is the low expectation that your disability is as good as it gets 2030 the shift to consider changes in how we treat severe mental illness is the pendulum that needs to swing the other way the grand experiment has failed in closing down all the institutions and care and stopping all treatment and not allowing community mental health it is a principle that operated under the misguided selfcentered belief that people are always fully capable of deciding their own fate regardless of their deficits and disease and the right to selfdecay and selfdestruction overrides this right to health in so doing we have come to comfortably advocate our responsibility to action and live under this perverse redefinition that the most compassionate compassion is to do nothing at all it further bolstered the most evil of prejudices that the person with disabilities deserves no more than what they are under that approach no dreams no aspirations no goals to be better can even exist indeed to help a person heal is a headon collision with the bigoted belief that the severely mentally ill have no right to be better than what they are and we have no obligation to help them this is the corrupt evil of the handsoff approach in the antitreatment model and that perversion of thought is embedded in the glorification that to live a life of deterioration and paranoia and filth and squalor and emotional torment trumps a healed brain and the true chance to choose a better life this is the movement of hatred and stigma toward the mentally ill disguised as the right to let them be sick that hatred may be embedded in our own anger our own resentment and ones own past experiences projected as blame or misattribution of the lives of others or maybe our own fear and loathing of the mentally ill either way the outcome is tragically the same so we can have more moments of silence or we can have times of action i hope the energy and commerce committee picks this up i hope that more members of congress will sign on as cosponsors of h r 2646 the helping families of mental health crisis act the day that bill signs into law it will begin to save lives it will begin to make a difference in peoples lives of all the other things we do down the road here for images or to push pollingi can tell you this that the polling on this bill is in 70s and 80s as politicians we think wow if something polls at 55 percent vote for it my concern is will america wake up and look toward congress here and say when we had a chance to do something to save lives did we act or are we once again just caught up in moments of silence thomas jefferson said something along the lines of indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just and his justice cannot sleep forever we are in that same position now we can either have the courage to stand up take action and help the mentally ill or we can sit in silence i hope this chamber soon takes up h r 2646 the helping families in mental health crisis act i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
