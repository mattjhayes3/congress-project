of the house should have an opportunity to hear and to vote on we have been denied that opportunity by the committee on rules we think that this makes a travesty of the socalled democratic process

do not expect that of a responsible president who is giving a state of the union address if his program is implemented by the congress it will be in my view a prescription for disaster he has

justice thurgood marshall justice marshall will be remembered forever as americas leading crusader in the fight for equality and justice he vigorously served as a true pillar of the civil rights movement as the chief architect of the legal strategy which questioned and subsequently put an end to officially sanctioned segregation in the united states justice marshalls legacy is destined to influence the lives of many for years to come a celebration of the legacy of africanamerican leadership would not be complete without the observance and acknowledgement of the profound contributions and achievements of this truly distinguished leader hindered by numerous obstacles countless confrontations and seemingly insurmountable challenges justice marshall always seemed to rise to the occasion he was forced to valiantly display his cunning ability to persevere in spite of all odds and forces working against him early on in life after completing high school justice marshall went on to attend lincoln university in pennsylvania in 1925 and upon graduation applied to the state law school in baltimore however because of the segregated time in which he grew up thurgood marshall was not admitted because of the color of his skin as a result he registered at howard university law school whereupon he graduated at the top of his class in 1933 and began a solo law practice in baltimore during the depths of the depression with an undying passion in his heart for justice and equality for all justice marshall was selected as general counsel to the naacp legal defense fund in 1936 where for 25 years he traveled throughout the nation representing the interests of black citizens who were systematically denied their constitutional rights provided in the constitution itself thurgood marshall made it his life ambition to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination he fought hard to protect individual and minority rights one of marshalls most important victories occurred in 1954 when he successfully argued before the supreme court the school desegregation case brown v board of education the court ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal justice marshall also valiantly represented the black students vho sought to gain entry to central high school in little rock ar he also fought to protect the civil rights of many of the students who staged lunch counter sitins and integrated the southern bus lines in freedom rides justice marshalls fervent dedication to and belief in the constitution of the united states gained the attention of more than just a few then president john f kennedy appointed him to the unitedstates second circuit court of appeals in new york in 1961 four years later former president lyndon b johnson nominated him for the position of unitedstates solicitor general and on june 13 1967 thurgood marshall was catapulted to greater prominence by being nominated by president johnson to be the first black to serve on the supreme court through thurgood marshalls professional career he sought to enhance and secure equality in the personal lives of all americans his legacy is one for all to recognize and acknowledge marshall so aptly used our constitutional september 15 1993 c traditions to revive our democratic traditions it is today that we take great pride in rising to celebrate the contributions

elementary and secondary education spending has been cut drastically 1 twelve years ago it was about 9 percent of the total education budget today it is down to 6 percent of the total education budget most of it spent by state and local governments that means that over the last 12 years the decisionmakers here in washington have consistently trivialized the federal role in the national education

would be levelfunded the cbc and progressive budget on the other hand provides for a 2 billion increase for the chapter 1 program with these funds we would be able to serve an additional 2 million

among environmental organizations throughout the country but markedly among fishery groups among groups that are very concerned about the crashing of stocks of fish in the pacific northwest and over

the original redwood forests in green is what remained as of 1992 of the virgin redwood forests of humboldt and del norte counties several members have referred to the fact that there are less than 5 percent of this ancient forest remaining in fact just about 100 years ago wnere were over 2 million acres of these forests stretching from santa cruz county to southern oregon today there are less than 80 000 acres remaining this tract the headwaters forest tract represents the largest privately owned remaining tract of ancient redwood trees left in the world many speakers have referred to how this is an irreplaceable resource this is not something that will happen again these are trees which have grown since the time of christ they are 300 feet to 350 feet in height they are 18 feet in diameter they should not be cut down to make porch furniture or decking these are our heritage for the future second i would like to refer to this map which shows the extent of the 44 000 acres i think it illustrates why this bill has taken in this much acreage a lot of speakers have said ok let us save the 5 400 acres of ancient forest but the rest maybe is not all that important this map outlines the 44 000acre tract and shows that those boundaries have been drawn so that the remaining important tracts of virgin redwood forests can be included the brown part here which is approximately 3 000 acres is what is commonly called the headwaters forest the other tracts which arein green are also very significant stands of virgin redwood together they make up about 5 300 acres of land which this bill seeks to protect the remaining acreage 88 percent of this land about 39 000 acres is secondand thirdgrowth forests this forest under this bill will continue to be harvested on a sustained yield basis however it is not enough merely to preserve the stands of virgin old growth and leave the rest to be clearcut we need to treat this unit as one ecosystem and manage it as one ecosystem otherwise we are going to have the same kinds of situation happen in northern california that we have already experienced with the northern spotted owl secretary babbitt often speaks in terms of environmental train wrecks and the kind of train wreck we had in the pacific northwest when the northern spotted owl was listed as an endangered species and 11 million acres was tied up when that occurred we cannot allow that to happen again and unless we protect these stands of old growth ancient redwood forests we will have more environmental train wrecks we will have more people thrown out of work because lands are tied up we will have less salmon in our streams for our fishermen to catch and overall we will hurt our regional economy the material referred to previously is as follows by david w galltz the pacific lumber company said today that h r 2866 as modified by the house committee on agriculture now contains significant amendments that fully protect the companys rights as a private property owner john a campbell president and chief executive officer of the pacific lumber company said although the legislation still authorizes the acquisition of up to 44 000 acres the bill now clearly says that no acquisition can occur without our consent in essence the 44 000 acres is not at risk thats good news for us because in fact we continue to be opposed to the sale of 44 000 acres despite that unwillingness to sell 44 000 acres and our disagreement with the way in which the oil characterizes our forest management practices we have decided to support h r 2866 with its important amendments in the house of representatives because the bill appears to be a vehicle for resolving the issue of government acquisition of the much smaller headwater forest pacific lumbers

full lawful use and enjoyment of its lands and confirming that enactment of the bill is not to be construed as imposing any new limitations upon the implementation of any timber harvest plans a provision clarifying that the government has no right under the legislation to develop a socalled management plan for any portion of the 44 000 acres that it does not acquire a provision stating that the governments authority under the legislation to acquire any lands even with pacific lumbers consent expires after ten years a provision that requires the secretary of agriculture to come up with a plan within six months for acquiring specific lands within the 44 000 acres that the government wishes to acquire a related provision requires the secretary to identify specific federal properties

lost their home because they had no health care coverage this country can do better we can sit down and be rolled by the people with money by those who want to profit off of the present system or we can join together as a country and make sure that we cover all of our families and all of our children small business in america for the vast majority provide health care for employees but the

that keeps their choice but if we fail to act as a congress and as a country if we let those special interests who think profit is more important than the economic health and the physical health of this country we have but ourselves as citizens to blame i would ask every citizen watching this house this office watching this house operate this president fighting for health care reform to write to their elected officials to speak out and demand that we take action this year call the plan what you like but it seems to me unless it had the fundamentals that mandate coverage for every american that mandates coverage that you cannot lose when you lose your job that mandates coverage that you can keep the coverage even when you change jobs if we do not do that we are not getting the job done we can do that with the help of my colleagues in this chamber if they hear from their constituents do not be frightened by rhetoric from those who benefit from the present system every other civilized

the members and their staff will listen to the debate we are about to engage in on the goals 2000 education bill this is not a technical amendments bill this is not a reauthorization bill this legislation is breaking new ground with regard to the federal role in education and if enacted into law would be the first federal effort to improve all schools for all children in this regard i think it is critically important to allow the broadest degree of discussion debate and amendments i have been a part of the debate on the federal role in school reform from the outset the original school reform bill was a hawkinsgoodling bill in the 101st congress in addition i sit on the national education goals panel with mr kildee as representatives of the house members i also had a major role in shaping the kildeegoodling school reform legislation considered in the 102d congress the bill being considered today is the product of a 5year process to determine how the federal government can assist state and local school reform efforts without doing damage to the excellent progress being made across the country as you can imagine it is not easy for the congress to get involved in something as new and dynamic as the school reform movement without dictating what exactly we think everyone should or should not do generally the bill before you today is a good one it incorporates many of the ideas that president bush and lamar alexander talked aboet under the title of america 2000 it authorizes the national education goals panel to inform the nation about our progress toward the six national education goalswhich by the way we are never going to reach at the current pace it creates a process whereby national organizations of teachers and other educators can create descriptions of what all american students should know in the core curriculum areasvoluntary national content standards a grant program is authorized that would give states limited federal funds to carry out the activities associated with school reform efforts at least 75 percent of these funds would go to the school level to provide the wherewithall to make the systemic changes necessary to increase student learning from the start writing effective legislation in this area has been a balancing act by its very nature the school reform movement is a grassroots bottomup effort that began with and has been driven by states and schools across the country the lack of federal involvement up to this point has probably been a good thing the danger of federal assistance in this area has always been that congress form of help would be an example of what states were trying to get away fromuniform topdown regulation driven onesizefitsall solutions for the most part the bill sent to us by the administration avoided this pit fall perhaps because both president clinton and secretary riley had experience as governors actually implementing school reform the introduced bill was outcome oriented and generally nonprescriptive however as the bill moved through the committee amendments were added that made the bill unacceptable to the president secretary riley the governors the business organizations that originally supported the bill and most importantly the educators who are trying to implement these difficult changes i was pleased to hear that the substitute bill h r 3210 removes most of those objectionable amendments there remains some contradictory provisions in the bill relating to how prescriptive the federal government will be in requiring states to enforce their standards some of us including mr condit and myself feel that this lack of clarity in the bill could be interpreted to be a mandate on states to meet standards required by the act even though federal funds will never come close to covering it i believe that ours is really a clarifying amendment in that the committee report clearly states that there was no intention to create such an unfunded mandate on states the president in a letter to me on h r 1804 stated that t was not his intention to influence state fiscal priorities with this legislation the governors and chief state school officers support the intentions of this amendment further there has been some concerns raised about the effects of this bill on state and local control of curriculum and instructional practice our amendment clarifies the intent of congress in this regard as well it is very important that this amendment be adopted and made part of h r 1804 only with its adoption will many of us who share these concerns vote in support of the legislation with regard to title iv of h r 3210 establishing a national board for the development of industryrecognized skill standards i continue to have specific concerns over the lack of a leadership role provided in the legislation for business and industry due to the realization that unitedstates competitiveness is increasingly dependent on the skills of the american workforcebroadbased support has arisen for development of a national system of occupational skill standards in the united states while i support the development of such a system i am convinced that our success is dependent on making this an industryled effort otherwise the standards will not be used during committee consideration of the goals 2000 legislation we offered amendments to address these concerns unfortunately our efforts failed but our resolve has not while our concerns persist we will not offer any amendments to tite iv today dealing with the issue of industry leadership based on knowledge that a compromise is being developed in the senate that will address these concerns we understand that the senate compromise will make changes in the composition of the national board as well as require that the boards chairperson come from the business community for the first 2year terms it is our hope to work toward this compromise as we go to conference with the senate on the goals 2000 legislat on evep with these reservations i do recognize the fact that we have come a long way in addressing concerns originally identified in title iv of h r 1804 as introduced resulting in a much better piece of legislation finally i wish to note that while i am pleased that most of the very contentious civil rights issues raised by earlier drafts of title iv have been resolved i do have concern over certain language n the committee report the last sentence on page 50 which appears to require rigid adherence to the uniform guidelines on employee selection procedures and the standards of the american psychological association this very well may not be a correct reading but if it is i believe this will create problems for many reasons i believe the board

taken up in the tax bill and appropriately targeted i also do not agree that cuts and adjusted means testing of higher income seniors and medicare should be defined today this needs much more work and

whether one loses their job whether one changes jobs whether one goes off to start their own business whether one is a child covered under their parents plan and then goes off on their own that they

confuse the debate television and radio show hosts who talk about criminal penalties for private payment to doctors reflect nothing that exists in the legislation but it was used to create confusion

care before us the majority of the republicans felt the present system was good enough indeed at the beginning of the debate they tried to say there was ne health care crisis to say that congress should not act on health care the american people rejected their real position now many of them have come back with modified positions which really obfuscate their basic belief which is the government should not get involved and there tract record is pretty certain on this one most of the leaders of the other party who are in congress today frankly opposed the medicare provisions the gentleman from

several other members in a bipartisan way until it is resolved that is the issue of congressional reform in august 1992 in a clear bipartisan effort both democrats and republicans joined together to establish for the first time in nearly half a century what has become known as the joint committee on the organization of congress the committee was established in a bipartisan way because of the fact that we in this house were in the midst of a number of scandals frankly as we look at those items which led to the establishment of the joint committee on the organization of congress the house restaurant house bank and the post office scandals many of the problems continue to loom they led to the establishment of the committee and i believe that we have unfortunately ignored not only those but many of the other institutional issues which desperately need to be addressed as we move towards the 21st century in the early years of this country when the census was taken following the census that 10year period of time the committee structure for the congress was modified unfortunately if we look at the reforms that took place in the 1940s under what is known as the monroneyla follette committee we have seen virtually no reform of the committee system that is nearly half a century and we have not as we have observed tremendous changes throughout the world changed this institution earlier today one of my colleagues on the joint committee on the organization of congress the gentleman from cape girardeau missouri talked about the fact that we in the congress have spent a great deal of time talking about reform of the health care system reform of the welfare system reform of wetland policy reform of the educational structure reform of virtually every area and yet while there has been a great deal of talk there has been no action here in the congress now this committee was put into place to serve for 1 year and 1 year only i was very enthused about the prospect of serving on a committee in congress which would actually go out of existence because it is a real rarity around here once a committee is established it is like moving heaven and earth to try and bring that committee even if it has completed its work to a close so when i was asked to serve on this committee that would go into effect on january 1 1993 and out of existence on december 31 1993 i thought wow what a terrific opportunity to buckle down work hard and spend eyery moment that i possibly could outside of my work on the committee on rules and other items that i had focusing on reform of this institution it was a wonderful experience we worked in a bipartisan way the great thing about this committee was that there were an equal number of republicans and an equal number of democrats an equal number of house members an equal number of members from the senate with that 28member committee we were presented with this chance to come forward and be bold and do the kinds of things that the american people and i sincerely believe a majority of the members of this body want us to do we had on our side of the aisle my colleagues mr solomon mr walker"], [0.003337681293487549,

into law will give a political voice to millions of americans this bill is a commendable step toward removing existing barriers to voter registration by simplifying and standardizing the voter registration process it is estimated that the national voter registration act will result in the registration of 90 percent of all eligible voters however much work remains in the area of voting procedures with the number of elderly and disabled voters likely to soar during upcoming decades it is vital to find alternatives to traditional voting procedures new technologies promise potential for providing those incapable of reaching the polls with an opportunity to vote in the state of new mexico an innovative project was conducted during last yeas election whereby new mexicos secretary of state in conjunc tion with sandia national laboratories administered a mock election in this election partictpafnt cast their votes by phone while this system would never replace normal voting procedures voting by phone could provide an altemative means of exercising the right to vote td those who have difficulty reaching the pools implementation of this project in actual election would significatly benefit new mexlo a rural state with a large elderly population in edition the success of new mexicos votingbyphone project suggests the possibility of nationwide application clearty the security of such voting procedures must be airtight assurances that each voter votes only once that votes cast are taltied and reported correctly and that the system is impevious to outside tampering remain to be fully resolved sandia national laboratos expertise in developing related forms of defense security could provide the technology to solve these security concerns the state of new mexico and sandja laboratodes are to be applauded for their efforts to explore new voting procedures the development of new voting procedures must continue where the motorvoter bill ends i am proud to tend

madam chairman i want to say first that i strongly support the passage of the legislative appropriation bill i think the chairman has done an excellent job madam chairman we are going to make sure in the future that appropriations and authorizations track each other more carefully for purposes of avoiding the kinds of shortfalls that we have experienced for fiscal year 1994 madam chairman the question of the gentleman from pennsylvania is how long have these things been owing the senate has had the architect do things for them that the architect has paid for out of its budget we believe that these things fall into that category in other words we believe that the architect even house administration have had things done for it by his that they should now pay for we believe that in an austeritytype situation we are in in 1994 that the best answer is to bill these entities for work that they have done to his that is a shortterm solution it is not a longterm solution but we believe that the gentleman from florida and the gentlemanfrom california have crafted what can be a longterm solution for 1995 and a model of that followed for the future but i restate we do need to talk more in the future about a matching of authorizations and appropriations we have always allowed some slack because that gave the committee flexibility to reprogram some funds but we may have to change that in the future madam chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time"]]}
