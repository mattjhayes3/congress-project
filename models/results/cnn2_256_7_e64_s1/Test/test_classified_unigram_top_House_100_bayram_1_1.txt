warhead doe has the expertise to dismantle nuclear weapons and the capability to safely burn the nuclear materials couverting the energy into electricity or other peaceful forms this process will eliminate any future use of the mate rials for destructive purposes why demonstrate a known technology to prove to the world that we are ready to take the next step in securing lasting peace in the

an important policy statement it is not a jobs bill it calls for a demonstrationnot a project i envision the demonstration using one united states weapon and hopefully one soviet weapon the demonstration can be carried out by existing staff at two or three existing facilities of the department of energy in practice the nuclear warhead would retrace its path backward through the manufacturing cycle the first stop would be the rocky flats installation for dismantling of the weapon then the nuclear material would be sent to the los alamos laboratories where the plutonium would be converted to plutonium oxide in powder or pellet form finally the plutonium oxide would be transported to the site of its final destruction at hanford or idaho falls where it would be loaded in fuel pins inserted in a fuel assembly line and burned in the reactor the activity at the reactor would take place concurrently with other research activities transportation of plutonium is routine the material is mildly radioactive and is shipped in accordance with unitedstates department of transportation regulations calling for double containment and super safe transport in unmarked vault type trucks shipments like these are regularly conducted by the department and the weapons burn demonstration materials would move with other regularly scheduled deliveries the secretary of energy has testified that we are awash in plutonium and that potential arms agreements could reduce the need even more but a growing school of thought holds that truly verifiable arms control is not possible

face an uncertain and unstable energy future in the absence of longrange planning and policies to provide for our needs in the next decade and beyond in addition our oil imports were slightly over onethird of our daily demand at the cost of almost 38 billion in 1986 when the united states ran up a record 156 billion trade deficit anything we can do to reduce oil imports in a responsible manner deserves our attention methanol is an alternative fuel that can reduce our oil imports by providing a reliable transportation fuel fleets of methanol cars and buses have been operating successfully in california for a number of years by the private sector and by the public sector through a program run by the california energy commission methanol can be made from natural gas or coal among other feedstocks as a cleaner burning fuel methanol permits greater use of coal in an environmentally sound manner while energy benefits are important i am particularly interested in the environmental benefits of cleaner burning fuels such as methanol i represent an area of southern california which is a nonattainment area under the clean air act we will not be able to achieve federal air quality standards without alternative fuels the use of methanol as part of an air quality strategy has been supported by the south coast air quality management district the california lung association and others the promise of methanol will not become a reality unless a vehicle can be delivered to consumers at a price comparable to conventional gasoline models the same goes for the cost of the fuel itself additional ontheroad experience is essential to determine how to expand the use of methanol and fleets are a good way to acquire such information for that reason h r 3399 requires the federal government beginning in fiscal year 1990 through 1993 to purchase automobiles and light duty trucks capable of running on methanol alone or on both methanol or gasoline dual fuel vehicles as part of the fleet it would otherwise purchase the secretary of energy is required to conduct studies on the performance of methanol and dual fuel vehicles since diesel emissions from trucks and buses are a

which made expedited consideration important i would also like to mention that the bipartisan manner in which house resolution 248 was handled at the subcommittee level and the full foreign affairs committee level has been exemplary i only wish that all the legislation before this great body could be so bipartisan in nature finally i would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york mr solarzi which in effect updates my resolution to reflect more accurately current events namely the resignation of the governor general of fiji effectively leaving prospects for the restoration of parliamentary constitutional democracy very remote for those of who may not be following events in the pacific archipelago of fiji a brief update of events might be in order at the time i drafted house resolution 248 there was reason to hope that the efforts of the governor general ratu sir penaia ganilau would prevail the anticipated result was to have been comprehensive political settlement between the royal fiji military forces and the deposed bavadra government unfortunately col sitiveni rabuka head of the fijian army derailed hardwon progress by heading a second coup on september 25 his publicly stated intention is to insure that the fijian parliament stays under the perpetual control of indigenous fijians fiji for fijians as he would say unfortunately this unilateral action disenfranchises the islands ethnic indian community which slightly outnumbers the native fijian population in an effort to underscore united states dissatisfaction with the loss of parliamentary constitutional democracy in fiji the administration suspended economic and miltiary aid united states policy in fiji has been consistently supportive of continued dialog and efforts to foster a national reconciliation satisfactory to both ethnic communities house resolution 248 merely articulates clearly our position it is imperative that the united states make it clear to the royal fijian military forces that we do not support any solution to the current political crisis which exacerbates racial tensions and legislates racial inequality i can understand nationalist or ethnic pride on the part of the fijian community what i cannot support are unilateral actions by one ethnic group to disenfranchise another politically and economically there are several models throughout the world such as trinidad which my good friend from california suggested where different ethnic groups have resolved political representation questions in a peaceful and orderly manner what it happening in fiji today though is quite the reverse the royal fijian military force led by colonel rambuka is attempting to constitutionally make the indian population in fiji secondclass citizens prior to rabukas september 25 coup the people of fiji both indian and native fijian alike had displayed remarkable patience and trust in the governor generals efforts to peacefully resolve a potentially explosive situation the governor generals mediation effort had succeeded in forming an interim government including 10 members of the coalition party and 10 members of the alliance party colonel rabuka had previously indicated support for the governor generals compromises but his fear that indians would be represented in equal number to native fijians apparently motivated his second coup it is ironic that the coup occurred just hours prior to the governor generals radio announcement declaring the successful formation of a transition government rabuka has snatched anarchy from the jaws of victory tragically we are now faced with a situation in which a national reconciliation in fiji appears to the tragic victim selfish vested interests to the detriment of national interests i do not believe that an authorization form of government in fiji is in the interest of this country nor does it express the will of the fijian population my resolution recognizes that a settlement of the current political crisis is well within the capabilities of the people of fiji my bill house resolution 248 is an attempt to express a policy with three unambigious objectives first to preserve parliamentary constitutional democracy second to recognize the rights of all the people regardless of their color creed race or ethnicity and third to oppose any unilateral action to solve the present crisis in fiji which is not representative of all the peoples of fiji i am confident that my resolution will have a positive effect on the fijian political

panetta and myself hunger among the homeless is an issue that has repeatedly surfaced during the hearings and research of the select committee on hunger at site visits to shelters and soup kitchens across the nation we consistently heard from service providers of the need to increase food assistance to the homeless the select committee on hunger report hunger among the homeless prepared last week reveals that the major federal food assistance programthe food stamp programis not serving a large percentage of homeless people the legislation before us today would address this concern by authorizing federal funding for food stamp program information directed to homeless persons the substitute also raises the ceiling on the excess shelter deduction from 152 to 168 in fiscal year 1988 this provision is intended to prevent hunger among the lowincome population whose scarce dollars are spent in a market where rents are going up and affordable housing is diminishing if they buy enough food for a sufficient diet they will be unable to pay their rent and thus eventually they may join the ranks of the homeless the select committee has repeatedly received testimony that rising housing costs are forcing lowincome families to choose between paying the rent and eating third shelter payments made by state or local welfare agencies to homeless shelters would be precluded from being counted as income therefore reducing food stamp benefits for homeless families homeless families are without food storage and preparation facilities they must shop daily for meals and must purchase expensive food in small quantities we must not allow homeless persons who have been denied the right to permanent shelter to also be denied nutrition assistance finally i want to stress the importance of the reauthorization of the temporary emergency food assistance program this program provides significant federal food assistance to both the private voluntary groups engaged in feeding the homeless and to lowincome families eigtheen million people received portions of the basic surplus commoditiesrice flour nonfat dry milk cheese butter cornmeal and honeyin fiscal year 1986 tefap is probably the most costeffective government food assistance program now in operation in my own state of texas it costs only 85 cents per family per year to deliver these basic commodities because they are delivered through the network of charitiable voluntary groups farmers also benefit when the commodities are distributed because the vast amounts now in storage depress prices and farm income commodities deteriorate in inadequate storage while homeless people forage in dumpsters for sustenance some may be concerned that the food assistance provisions of this measure will require limited new moneys in fiscal year 1988 and beyond by assuring access to food assistance for the homeless and assuring that rising shelter costs do not cause hunger among lowincome families we will undoubtedly save the longterm costs of the health and social consequences of homelessness again i urge my colleagues to support the substitute before us today these sections represent the significant steps for a domestic food aid policy that can prevent additional hunger and homelessness"], [0.995568698272109, 0.004431301727890968, 1, "the police force in prince georges county and indeed our entire community suffered

country did everything we could whether it was in accommodating the refugees by assuring their safety at the borders or whether it was assuring that the united states stood firmly against pol pot and the genocidal regime in cambodia i think all of us owe him a great debt of gratitude for his work and his leadership from the very beginning on the cambodian issue i also would like to thank the

first time in recent memory the cambodian people will have a chance for legitimate democratic selfrule while we should welcome the withdrawal of the vietnamese we must not forget who ruled cambodia for 4 years prior to the vietnamese invasion and who remain poised to retake control pol pot and his genocidal khmer rouge cadre the world community has condemned pol pot for his crimes against his own people it has condemned the khmer rouge for the horrors they visited upon the nation of cambodia yet recently it appears that pol pots military power which in the past has been used to harass the vietnamese coupled with chinese support for the khmer rouge have spoken louder than our strongest moral principles the time has come to end the ambiguity which has existed in unitedstates policy

his return to power in cambodia the time has come for this nation to prove that we are committed to the positions which our rhetoric has staked out the united states must press china to cease supplying arms to the khmer rouge these arms are ostensibly being provided in order to enable the khmer rouge to continue to harass the vietnamese troops occupying cambodia yet the khmer rouge are no longer putting pressure on the vietnamese they are stockpliing weapons and organizing support in the cambodia countryside they have weapons caches that will last them through 2 years of fighting these caches are an insurance policy for the khmer rouge ultimately what they will ensure is a future of terror for the people of cambodia with every bullet supplied by the chinese through thailand to the khmer rouge another ounce of hope for peace and democracy in cambodia is lost these arms supplies must stop the united states position must be clear we cannot afford any ambiguity whatsoever in 1975 the citizens of cambodia were abandoned to the horrors of the khmer rouge with the possibility of vietnamese withdrawal the future of cambodia is unclear there must be no question either in the world community or in the minds of the cambodian people where the united states stands in the villages of cambodia the people are asking whether they will again be abandoned it is imperative that the united states reassure the cambodian people and send them a clear message we will not remain silent while the khmer rouge regain their iron grip on cambodia 40 years ago the world reeled from the unimaginable revelations of the holocaust hitlers program of extermination so horrified mankind that we cried out never again pol pot represents just such an evil i urge my colleagues to support this

union is one of the most shameful wholesale violations of human rights in the world today soviet general secretary gorbachevs much publicized policy of glasnost or openness has yet to prove to be much more than tactical and cosmetic where it concerns jews in the soviet union the new socalled progressive emigration decree actually offers little hope to the hundreds of thousands of jews seeking the right to leave there had been some hope of a positive shift in soviet policy when some refuseniks noted that the emigration decree which updated a 1970 statute had by implication recognized that departure was not a criminal act and that under certain conditions ordinary citizens could depart from the unitedstatess r however upon closer inspection the decree codified restrictive practices in effect since 1980 which allowed jews to leave only on the basis of family reunification rather than as a fundamental right seemingly humanitarian it fixed in law the narrow definition of family as including only parents children and siblings condemning hundreds of thousands of people from ever applying for much less receiving permission to leave the new decree left soviet authorities with absolute power to reject applications for emigration it ignored many of the human rights provisions of the universal declaration of human rights the international covenant on civil and political rights and the more recent helsinki accords to which the soviet union is signatory the cold truth is that glasnost has changed little or nothing for soviet jews only 914 jews were permitted to leave the soviet union in 1986 compared with 1 140 in 1985 and 896 the previous year these figures are a far cry from the alltime high of 51 320 in if the soviet union is truly serious about human rights it

moderate balanced statement and i would simply like to add to it i myself have been deeply concerned i could use a lot of adjectives such as horrified and shocked to describe my feelings about what appeared to be the unmeasured response of the israeli government to the violence on the west bank and the announcement by the defense minister that israel is going to use force and beatings as a matter of policy that to me was totally illconsidered there is no question that israel pays a formidable price in international good will and credibility when statements like that are made of all the governments in the world of all the peoples in the world to use excessive violence it is hard to think of a country wvhose history within recent memory four decades makes such action less appropriate and more offensive i have to say that in all honesty it has been a very painful process for all of us here who have a deep sense of commitment to israel who want to see her survive who want to see her maintain her special relationship with our country and who want to see her maintain the very special moral and ethical quality that has differentiated israel from all the governments in the middle east and most of the governments in the world it has been painful for those of us who care about those things to see what is going on and i hope very much that israel will cease the policy of public beatings breaking hands and breaking bones in response to arab violence i regret saying this publicly but congressman barney frank of massachusetts did bring up this subject and he treated it in a very thoughtful way so perhaps it is appropriate to comment on it i expressed these views privately in an hourlong meeting with the israeli ambassador to the united states about a month ago so here i am going public but let me just add a footnote that first of all these are very trying experiences under similarly trying experiences with comparatively untrained or insufficiently trained troops we had our kent state we had our my lai and we consider ours a moral and an ethical country but sometimes the training of troops and the training of national guard personnel is not sufficient for the extraordinary conditions under which they all of a sudden have to function and i suspect there was some degree of lack of training and lack of preparedness for these violent episodes on the part of the israeli troops they are trained soldiers and they are trained for combat they are not trained for civil disobedience and civil rebellion and it must be quite clearly recognized that these young kids these palestinian kids were not playing kids games they were not playing spih the bottle they were not playing mumbletypeg they were playing lethal games when you throw a molotov cocktail people get killed when you throw large hunks of rock and cement people get killed a young arab youth was killed by a hunk of cement that was thrown by a palistinian and we have seen pictures of both soldiers and television cameramen writhing on the ground in agony after having been hit by large rocks these are very serious lethal games that the palestinian youth are playing apparently these lethal games are not entirely spontaneous some kind of master hand is organizing them and guiding them and i think the israeli government has an absolute right in its own self defense to meet that kind of lethal violence with sufficient force to quell it and to control it it is very difficult to measure what kind of force is sufficie force as we have found out in our country let me also say that the israeli government for 40 years repeatedly has expressed the position that it is willing to sit down with the arabs and talk about all the issues the only arab chief of tate who took them up on that was president sadat and we all know regrettably the tragic history that ensured fi 9m his pattern of cooperation and hi openhandedness in dealing with the state of israel assassination has become an accepted means of political expression in the arab world and no doubt one of the reasons which gives king hussein pause at accepting a public posture of cooperating with the is aelis is the memory that he has frorm childhood of the vision of his grandflther being shot down in cold blood by arab extremists when there was suspicion that his grandfather was cooperating with the jewish agency of palestine of course this long precedes the establishment of the jewish state in 1948 and perhaps it was true that he was cooperating with the jewish agency for palestine in trying to bring some kind of common understanding some kind of consensus some kind of compromise and some kind of conciliation to the very troubled period in those days predating the founding of the state of israel tlpat policy of assassination for willingness to meet with the israelis halfway or even a quarter of the way has persisted there have been a whole string of political assassinations directed against the socalled arab moderate such as the massacre of syrian citizens in the village of horns by syrian troops those assassinations have no doubt had a very stultifying impact on tlhe willingness of arab chiefs of state or arab civilians andcivic leaders to express some willingness to meet israel at the conference table israel today has a clearly expressed position of being ready to sit down and negotiate with the arabs on every aspect of peace whether israel should agree to a process of trading land for peace is a decision that only the israelis are capable of making how much land for how much peace i could not define the land areas on the west bank or in gaza that israel could reasonably give up without having to face far higher security risks these are very sophisticated military and security decisions that i do not feel qualified to make i am not sure that many of the 535 members of the house and senate are qualified to make that decision either how much peace what does peace mean peace certainly means more than nonbelligerency israel gave up a very considerable portion of land in the sinai desert to establish peace with egypt yet they did not get peace what they got was a minimal level of nonbelligerency peace means far more than that peace means commerce peace means the exchange of students peace means the exchange of scientists peace means the exchange of business people peace means joint programs for development of all kinds peace meaiis joint telecommunications projects involving radio and telephone and television peace means joint projects affecting the environment such as the mutual joint exploitation of the scarce water resources in the middle east and peace means the exchanr e of cultural representatives even with egypt the one country in the middle east that has gone further than a status of total belligerency even with that country israel signed a peace treaty but did not get peace at the most they have gotten a begrudging arrangement for nonbelligerency that is a lot the absence of war is a heck of a lot better than a continuation of war but still israel paid a great price for peace and did not ever get what we normally think of as the full measure of peace and the blessings of peace they got a small measure of nonbelligerency nothing more so israel had to do some agonizing introspection on how much land will not jeopardize their security for how much peace how much can israel trust a signature an arab signature on a peace treaty i do not know the answer to that i suspect the israelis are far more sophisticated and far better equipped to make that decision of haw much land they are willing to sacrifice for a collection of arab signatires on a peace treaty i suspect that the israelis are far letter qualified to make the decision a to whether if the arabs ever had a viable military option they would not instantaneously take advantage of it no matter how many signatures were on how many peace treaties i cannot answer that question all of these issues have to be factored into the question of how much land for how much peace these are agonizing questions for all of us and i would state that our predilection for pushing israel against her better judgment into a posture of agreeing to make some sacrifices of land for some kind of peace is basically dubious proposition i know that president reagan and secretary shultz would desperately and urgently like to see some kind of resolution or at least the beginnings of some kind of resolution to these agonizingly complicated and emotion ridden anxiety ridden problems of the middle east it is only natural they would they would take legitimate pride in that accomplishment i give president reagan total credit for having been a friend of peace in the middle east and having been a stout and loyal friend of the state of israel i give secretary shultz credit beyond my ability to express in words he has been an extraordinarily talented thoughtful wise human being in his policies toward the middle east and i must say that when he was appointed secretary of state coming to that job from the vantage point of having been ceo or chief executive officer of the bechtel corp doing billions of dollars of business in the middle east i and some of my colleagues had some pretty profound reservations about him but they were quickly dispelled when we had a chance to hear him out discuss the issues with him and watch his performance he is an extraordinary man no matter what administration succeeds the reagan administration i suspect that secretary shultz will be sorely missed for his great qualities of heart his great qualities of intellect and his great qualities of integrity and decency that shine forth in every arena he is a remarkable human being but i suggest that we have to think about a whole long succession of presidents at least since world war ii almost every one of whom had the same conviction that they wanted to settle this agonizingly difficult problem of the middle east on their turf they have come up with one quick fix after another in the 40 years since world war ii the israelis have a long memory and they have to place all these individual efforts by individual presidents and secretaries of state to find a solution to the problem on their watch they have to view all of these successive efforts with a long and deep sense of history and perhaps they look around the world and see that some problems just cannot be solved by a quick neat solution we have problems with the soviet union that apparently although hopefully they are being reduced in order of magnitude now for 40 years since world war ii have been virtually intractable after all of the negotiations that have taken place over the 7 years of the reagan administration we and the soviets are each still spending 300 billionodd a year on defense hopefully we will gradually reduce that amount but we have not solved the basic problems between ourselves and the soviet union the british who are about as civilized a people as has ever populated this earth have still got agonizingly difficult problems with the irish the irish have agonhlingly difficult problems between irish catholics and irish protestants when you go to ireland and you visit with the protestant leadership in belfast and then you say what wonderful people they are they are intelligent they are thoughtful they are witty and they have got a rich history surely they can be expected to negotiate away these problems then you go to dublin and you meet with the irish catholic leadership and you say what marvelous thoughtful intelligent people these are why cant they get together well they have not gotten together these problems go back 400 years apparently they are virtually intractable there arc other places around the world the problems that the belgians have with nonbelgianspeaking groups and the problems the frenchcanadiansthe quebecquoise the levesque supportershave with the englishspeaking government in canada seem to be comparatively intractable as well so there are problems around the world which do not seem to be susceptible to a quick fix of easy rapid solutions it is just possible that the israelis thinkand i do not know this for a factthat there are not any quick fixes to the problems between arabs and israelis and that in all likelihood once they get into the business of territoryforpeace they are going to be under great pressure to make sacrifices of territory that are not in their best interests there are some israelis who have profound misgivings about the nature and quality of the land they gave back to egypt when they made a peace with egypt i think they expected a larger richer definition of peace than what they got so there may be some reservations about moving down that slippery slope of peaceforterritory or territoryforpeace i would respect their right to make those decisions and i would respect their right to tell us look we understand your tremendous eagerness your noteworthy praiseworthy eagerness to bring some kind of solace peace and reconciliation to the middle east but after the peace conference is over you all go back home and we are the ones who are left to live with these understandings we are the ones who have to evaluate over the years how much territorial sacrifice in terms of real security we made for how much of a peace what value do we place on that peace how much can we rely on that peace how much can we rely on the integrity of the arab signatures on that peace treaty there is no one who can make those decisions there is no one who can examine that calculus of factors other than the israelis themselves so i want to say how much i respect congressman frank for the very thoughtful way in which he treated this issue i want to say how much i respect the 30odd members of the senate for their bona fides and their real desire to contribute to world peace by the letter that they recently wrote to prime minister shamir but i think on the bottom line once we have made some suggestions and once as friends we have given whatever advice we choose to give the israelis on the way they have controlled the riotsand remember from their point of view it has to be considered gratuitous adviceonce we have given them our best judgment on adopting this policy or that policy or refusing to adopt this posture or that posture and explain that their decision may have a price tag and may cost them in good will military and economic aid and may cost them in credibility around the world then i think in all fairness we ought to let the israeli knesset the israeli military and security branches of their government make the hard decisions on into the actual process of reconciliation negotiation and compromise they have had the offer on the table ever since 1948 to talk what kind of preconditions we should impose upon them as to how and under what circumstances the talks get started is a very serious question i suggest that we should be very reluctant to force israel into any format into any system of negotiations that they feel may threaten their security they are a sovereign state we are a great friend of theirs we can give them advice and counsel and express the costs and the benefits to them of various alternative policies but when it comes to biting the bullet and making these critically important decisions involving the security of the region the peace for the region and the security of the state of israel i think we are going to have to let them think and decide for themselves i thank the speaker and yield back the balance of my time"], [0.003910660743713379, 0.5039106607437134, 1, "this is the sixth time in 3 years this house has debated the merits of a textile quota bill i am beginning to understand the man who said its deja vu all over again let me just say this i think that by now all members probably know how they are going to vote on this override with that in mind and realizing that i am not going to convince any supporters of the bill to change their votes let me say a few things to those of you who have opposed the bill but now find yourself considering to change your vote two years ago the house considered and sustained the presidents veto of a similar textile and footwear quota bill at that time proponents of the bill claimed that unless legislation were enacted imports would continue to flood our markets and overwhelm our domestic industry in the 2 years since then the domestic textile industry has seen production increase exports increase employment increase profits increase about the only thing that has decreased seems to be imports proponents of this bill claim that it is an issue of jobs well all of us in this chamber care about jobs but will this bill really save jobs for americans or does it merely save a few peoples jobs at the expense of a lot of other people i care about all of my constituents jobsfrom the garment worker to the dock worker to the store clerk to the construction worker i dont think its fair for me to support legislation which so unequivocally favors one group of workers at the expense of others the congress should pass laws which ensure the economic wellbeing of all americans we did that just a few months ago when we enacted the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 the omnibus trade bill tells the world we want free and fair trade open markets and expanded opportunities for unitedstates exports this textile bill tells the world just the opposite it says that the united states wants to tear up internationally agreed trade rules pass special protection for its politically powerful industries and make other americans pay the price this flies in the face of all the work we have done here in the congress to make american the leader in the fight for fair world trade now more than ever this bill should be defeated i think many proponents of this bill sincerely believe it will help improve our economy many believe weve been october 4 1 988"]]}
