served them so ably for 16 years in congress at the time he retired from this body herm held the distinguished position of ranking republican member of the house ways and means committee while serving in that capacity herm was a leading advocate for insuring that unitedstates industry remained competitive and was not put at a disadvantage with foreign countries in its trade dealings he was concerned with health insurance reform an interest stemming from his work as a member of the board of managers at williamsport hospital and his fundraising efforts for better nursing facilities in that area i for one am glad that he lived to see this congress pass the economic recovery tax act of 1981 for the capital gains tax provision contained within the package was a brainchild of his back in the 93d congress throughout his years of service herm was known as a gop maverick and it is this trait his independence which i remember mostthe independence of convictionthe courage to make difficult choicesthat i believe is necessary to best serve all of ones constituents from lycoming to dauphin in union and northumberland counties and throughout these halls and committee rooms herm was noted for being a man who had all the enviable qualities so needed in public life his associates found him to be an indefatiguable worker and a member who also had sound business sense at this time may i extend my condolences to herms wife mary lou to his daughters marta and susan and to all his family and personal friends in the early sixties herm was cited for his outstanding work in raisizig funds for worthy projets in the south cental pennsylvania area i paraphrase from newspaper accounts words which hold true some 20 years later herman schneebell was serious but at the same time friendly he was deliberate but could also act quickly when the occassion demanded he was calm and unruffled but spoke his mind when necessary he had convictions but also appreciated the opinions

accusation that it hurts the poor and the needy r we have heard that accusation in this chamber we have read it in major newspapers this morning i want you to know we consider it a serious charge all

accusations and i am not here to give our bipartisan troops a rousing pep talk i think we all have gone beyond such dramatics i am here instead to remind you of certain facts in the past 10year period

percent increase or 9 4 percent a year ssi expenditures have risen from 2 3 billion to 8 billion a 250 percent increase or 25 percent a year this is the basic reason why federal spending has soared out of control and why we are facing these massive deficits the poor the needy the elderly those who need help in our society cannot and will not be helped by policies whose maj6r assumptions are

has not been heard around here for so long leadership with all that it means in terms of foresight and yes courage to do the right thing let me say one final thing about a rumor that has been floating around here it says that if the latta substitute goes down the speaker and i will rush off to some secluded rendevous and put together a compromise i do not know where that myth started but it has about as much basis in reality as the loch ness monster or big foot there is little room or little time left now for compromise do not think there is a liferaft waiting for you if the bipartisan substitute goes down we all go down not just those of us in this house but millions of americans still waiting for us to act i am not going to review the torturous process by which we arrived at this point i will let historians trace the history of the gang of 17 the endless frustrating skull sessions in rooms all over the capitol and buildings all over town for 4 long months the hand of compromise has been extended for all of that time and it has been turned aside today is what matters right now is what matters either we do it right this time or else history and the american people will neverand should neverforgive us if i have any time left i want to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to those on the democratic side who have helped us fashion our bipartisan substitute these members within the last 2 weeks sat in on our deliberations with the socalled gypsy moths and yellow jackets and its was a learning process for all those members involved there was not a one who got his way everyone had to give some and take some and on my own side where there were some marked differences of opinion and shades of philosophy represented on the various issues i want to compliment my members for their cooperative spirit and their willingness to give and take all in the interest of putting together a winning combination that is the name of the game we feel we have put

increase revenues by an estimated 2 1 billion in fiscal year 1983 since what made sense for the irs would also seem to make sense for the customs service on february 15 i asked the commissioner of customs for a report on the amount of additional revenues an additional 1 000 customs personnel would raise i have just received the agencys report an additional 1 000 personnel scattered among various functions would result in an additional 100 million in revenues largely from those who are evading and ignoring the nations trade and tariff laws this represents a return of 3 for every 1 in additional personnel from this data it appears that the presidents proposal to lay off 2 300 customs personnel will cost the lawabiding public approximately 130 million or more with this kind of misplaced judgment no wonder the reagan administration is facing a series of increasing deficits i hope the congress will recognize the foolishness of this type of budgetcutting and will prevent the

distinguished new dean carlos moorhead in having taken the time for this special order to give some recognition to some of us who have been described as the magnificent seven i guess we would have to say that really there is maybe a magnificent six with one alsoran and that is the member who is speaking now i was genuinely moved by all the remarks that have been made about our distinguished colleagues and i think the thipg that impresses me the most is the sincerity with which these presentations were made by each and every one of the members we are told that a friend is one who comes to you when all others leave that is particularly significant for all those who have gone through a number of elections and then find themselves on the losing side of an election that is in itself a test of the caliber and character of an individual i would also suggest to those who are leaving as i have tried to convey to my friends something that i believe has relevance to those of us who are departing and that is that a real happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery when he has to take a detour so i am going to be presenting my remarks concerning all the distinguished californians with whom i have served and i would like to offer a few comments about at least the three members who are here on the floor i am pleased to come to the well and pay this tribute to my fellow californian wayne grisham who will be leaving the congress at the end of his present term we can ill afford to lose members with the ability dedication and unlimited potential of my good friend wayne grisham he is leaving behind an impressive record of service to our state and this nation and in that respect he has only continued the pattern he set before coming to the nations capitol in fact wayne onisham left one highly distinguished career in the city government and business community of la mirada to start another one in washington in he wasted no time putting to work his strong background of experience in both local government and the private sector in the relatively short span of 4 years wayne has played a very active and effective legislative role in congress it has been my good fortune to have worked closely with wayne on the public works and transportation committee he has been a particularly valuable member of our aviation and water resources subcommittees having served as a fighter pilot in world war ii wayne has had a special interest in aviation his experience and expertise in this area have enabled him to make an important contribution to the cause of a safe and efficient airport and airway system wayne brought to the public works and transportation committee and to the post office and civil service committee on which he has also served a firsthand knowledge of public works transportation and other needs facing the cities and towns of america that background also served him well as a member of the suburban caucus and the travel and tourism caucus with his extensive knowledge of local transportation needs it therefore was only natural that wayne should play a key congressional role in important transportation projects such as the century freeway project which provides for the construction of a roadway through the very heart of los angeles county eventually to connect the east and west sides wayne grishams world war ii experience which included being shot down over germany and becoming a prisoner of war undoubtedly helped shape his great appreciation for and commitment to a strong national defense and he has worked tirelessly and effectively to that end throughout his service in the house wayne has also built a strong record in support of fiscal responsibility in government a balanced budget lower taxes less government intervention and a reduction in both government spending and excessive regulation he has pursued his concern for reducing government regulation as a very active member of the regulatory reform task force those of us who have had the opportunity to serve with wayne grisham have been most fortunate he has been one of our most dedicated and hardworking members and i shall miss working closely with him in committee and in this chamber i am pleased to tribute to my good fellow california colleague barry goldwater jr who will be ending his congressional service at the close of the 97th congress our state and the nation is losing a highly effective public servant in barry goldwater jr and certainly the 98th congress will miss his tremendous contributions having worked closely for the past 14 years with him on matters affecting california and the nation i know very well the void his departure will leave in this chamber bairy goldwater jr has made an enormous impact on the affairs of government since coming to congress in 1969 his california constituents wisely returned him to washington for seven consecutive terms and as a result we in this chamber have had the good fortune to enjoy barrys special talents and coriderable legislative experience he has been a valuable member of the minority leadership of both the public works and transportation and science and technology committees on the latter he serves as the ranking republican of the transportation aviation and materials subcommittee and he is a member of the energy research and pruduction subcommittee it has been a special pleasure for me to have served with barry on the public works and transportation committee he has served on both our aviation and investigations and oversight subcommittees his leadership during this congress as the ranking minority member of the investigations and oversight subcommittee has enabled that subcommittee under the able chairmanship of elliott levitas to meet its mandate to provide oversight of the important programs under our committees jurisdiction certainly in the field of aviation an area in which he and i share a common interest barry goldwater jr has had few equals his special insight into the problems needs and potential of aviation particularly general aviation and his vast legislative experience in this area have proven invaluable to the development of sound legislation to insure the growth of a healthy national airport and airway system of course barrys record of accomplishment ranges far beyond the scope of public works and transportation he has been one of our most outspoken members and particularly so in assessing the proper roles of the federal government he has led the fight to limit the growth and size of government to end unfair government competition with the private sector and to protect the rights of states against encroachment from the federal government he has also applied his expertise as a member of the energy research and production subcommittee to the vital search for workable solutions to our nations energy problems all americans can be thankful for the successful efforts of barry goldwater jr in guiding his landmark 1974 right to privacy act into public law as a result private citizens now have access to government files about them whenever barry has attacked an issue he has done so with his full energies dedication and tenacity and far more often than not he has been highly successful in his efforts his efforts have been guided always by what he considered in the best interest of his constituents and the nation his presence and his leadership will be missed in our california delegation and in the congress and i personally will miss his good counsel as a member of this body it is with a great sense of loss that i rise with my colleagues in paying tribute to my colleague and friend bon dornan who will be ending his distinguished tenure as representative of the 27th congressional district of california for these past 6 years boa has represented his constit uents with a zeal of legislative purpose and direction and he can be most proud of his record of congressional actions which includes being the only member of the minority party to have a record of 24 amendments passed and to have been appointed as chairman of the house task force on american prisoners and missing in southeast asia we have all known bob as an individual who has worked above and beyond the call of duty on issues that are consistant with the ideals for which he stood and i am proud to have had the opportunity to list bob as one of the most esteemed members of the california delegation and a special friend bob dornan will be remembered as the champion of such mutually shared concerns as returning our vietnam pow mias the prolife movement restoring the production of the b1 bomber and stopping the sale of american high technology items to the soviet bloc countries many of these causes had been a focal point of interest to bou long before the initiation of his congressional career many arericans became acquainted with bob when he was a tv news anchorman during the vietnam era as a war correspondent bob aired 14 air combat stories consequently bobs interest in the pow mia movement had been an ongoing concern for the past 17 years bob had served in the unitedstates air force for 5 years as a fighter pilot then 18 years in the air force reserve during this time he had personally flown over 17 highperformance united states and foreign fighters boas background represents a significant expertise factor which contributed to the solving of difficult legislative issues regarding our military and civilian aircraft systems and the questions of selling american technological systems to foreign governments bob is a leader who has successfully mastered the rare combination of technological competence and humanitarian concerns since the 1960s boa has been active in civil rights issues and he has achieved recognition for his work in this area by being the recipient of several awards which include the brandeis award the cardinal mindzenty award the tom dooley award the hungarian freedom fighters award and numerous community awards for work against drug abuse it was my privilege and honor to have had the opportunity to work with boa dornan these past 6 years boa has been a shining example of the high principles and standards which is the cornerstone tradition set forth by our founding fathers to which we all strive as members of this esteemed body of congress above all bob is a gentleman in the world of our great statesmen and most significantly a loyal and devoted husband to his lovely most patient and considerate wife sally and father to their beautiful family may the good lord bless and keep you and your family in the days ahead i rise to pay tribute to my dear friend and able colleague john rousselot during our many years in congress john has become known for his consistent efforts to fight excess government spending cut taxes and balance the federal budget john was one of the original supply side economic supporters very early he recognized that excessive federal taxes destroy initiative for individuals encouraging consumption rather than savings he has been honored with countless awards including the guardian of small business award watchdog of the treasury and even an emmy award for the lomaxrousselot debate on kttv television it is with sincere and profound sadness that i realize john rousselot will not be returning for the 98th congress those of us who have observed john closely realize he is a real dynamo and his attention to detail on the floor helps keep the house action honest he has extraordinary follow through if john gave you a commitment his word was his bond our colleague has a very distinguished record in the ways and means committee and the members will be deprived of his talents john has the ability to retain an inordinate amount of information pay close attention to detail and still he always finds the time for his colleagues and his constituency the congress will long remember the extraordinary legislative contributions joun has made to the american people i want to take this opportunity to express my sincere and heartfelt thanks to john his lovely wife yvonne and his three lovely children as a result of johns untiring and dedicated service he has left his footprints on this legislative body the great state of california and the united states of america as a spiritual and religious man i believe that god doesnt close one door without opening another i hope that the door s that open for john and his family will have a happy and rewarding future clan burgener has left his mark on the record of congress and most importantly in the minds of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who like myself were so privileged to serve with this outstanding legislator clair burgener began his public service on the san diego city council and the state legislature where he gained a reputation for performance and followthrough this reputation followed him to washington where he has become one of the most distinguished and respected members of congress in recent history on many an occasion i have heard people say that if there is a tough job to be done and you want the job done wellcall on clain burgener and he will see it through while i served as dean of the california republican delegation clair burgener took on a very special assignment as our representative on the allimportant committee on committees his sense of fairness and very constructive approach afforded us with results that far exceeded our expectations to say that he has earned our deepest admiration and respect is at best an understatement his position as secretary of the house republican conference is further testimony to this fact clair burgener has a richness of character that has afforded him unique access to the personalities particpating in the political process which has proved to be instrumental in his service as a key member on the house appropriations committee in that capacity clair will leave a legacy of energy and water projects such as santa margarita and the special initiatives in addressing reclamation reform which will stand forever as living monuments to the service of this very distinguished and congenial gentleman from southern california with all of these responsibilities and commitments clair burgener always made time to address our shared concerns for the handicapped and retarded which gained him recognition with a national constituency all of his qualities are based on a lifelong adherence to the christian ethicqualities which will leave a deep impression on me as i reflect back on our relationship clam and his lovely wife marvia both radiate the kind of goodness that makes them the kind of people you are very comfortable to be around while most of us have committed the golden rule to memory clair and marvia have committed it to their lives we of the california delegation and yours truly are proud to have them as special friends it gives me great pleasure yet a shared sadness in paying tribute today to one of my distinguished colleagues of the california delegation the honorable paul mcclosicey jr it is a great pleasure to recall the many years we have

such an amendment this government has been wading in a river of red ink for so long hardly anyone in this house remembers what it is like to walk on dry land there have been all kinds of attempts to balance the budget but most of those efforts were for political reasons not fiscal ones i cannot help but recall the balanced budget submitted by president carter and the impassioned plea our distinguished majority leader made on behalf of that phony document on the floor of this house that supposedly balanced budget resulted in a deficit of 60 billion but it was good politics then too i remember the law we passed requiring this congress to come up with a balanced budget by next year we all recall the balanced budget amendment efforts of our friend and colleague from california mr rousselot i think for a couple of years running his economic assumptions were closer to the mark than either the cbos or the administrations this year mr rousselot again proposed a balanced budget and i had to come to the very difficult conclusion not to vote for it only because i knew it was impossible of achievement this year that is our dismal record on deficits and balanced budget we haveset goals we have adopted rules we have passed laws and we have even passed balanced budgets but we have ony been able to actually produce one in the past 25 years the reason is simple the congresses of the past have never demonstrated the will to do what it takes to enact a balanced budget we have gone as far as we can with the balanced budget issue in this congress it is time to turn it over to the american people it is time to give them the issue it is time to say simply to the people that your congress cannot come to terms with it you decide you tell us what to do we know full well that a balanced budget is several years away we were in error last year thinking it was possible by 1984 we knew full well the depth and the breadth of a 20year spending spree it was wrong to assume we could just change the course of government overnight change attitudes policies practices and the politics of favoritism that had become so engrained in the legislative process if we have made any mistake in the last 2 years it was underestimating the damage that had been done to this countrys economy and overestimating our ability to turn it around on a dime what after pf1 is our goal it is to live within our means surely this is not a radical notion and we have the presidents words to guide us in his inaugural address he said this abot his economic program through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo make income balance outgo the presidents words are clear and unmistakable perhaps i should tell you that the president i have just quoted is not ronald reagan but franklin delano roosevelt on march 4 1933 is it not time we begin to redeem this pledge it has been almost 50 years we know now the magnitude of the problem and we know now that no ordinary course of action will suffice in solving it insuring the fiscal security of the government providing for the responsible management of american tax dollars in future years will require nothing less than a change in the basic framework of the law of our land that is what we sought to accomplish through the indexing of our tax system providing a longterm safeguard for the american taxpayer against the midnight raids on his paycheck that is what we seek to accomplish through this amendment a safeguard against future irresponsibility and a goal that we are obligated to achieve it has been said that the amendment would not work that is wrong it will the reason is that it will be founded on public mandate and public decree not political whim public mandates work when the people speak we do listen those who oppose this amendment simply do not want the people to speak they do not want to hear they do not want to obey the voice of the people

cast a difficult vote on this matter of great signifi cance the domestic content bill let me say from the outset that although i have some reservations and concerns regarding this bill i will support

and government taxation 1 am certain that most if not all members of the body remain concerned over another area of government activitythe area of government regulation i believe we are all committed to regulatory reform in those areas where reform is obviously appropriate such reform is obviously appropriate when the removal of burdensome regulation would promote competition without adversely affecting the american consumer for these reasons i take this opportunity to announce my intention to introduce in the not too distant future a bill aimed at achieving regulatory reform in the area of petroleum and petroleum product pipeline rates i hasten to add at this point that i am talking only about petroleum pipelinespipelines which are not franchised by the government and which are not in any sense of the term a legally protected monopoly in my view the government has the right if not the obligation to regulate rates of an industry when the government extends to that industry a franchise a license or any mechanism to protect it from competition with regard to petroleum pipelines however the government affords no protection from competition competition in the industry is extensive shippers have multiple options to serve their transportation needs and the consumers are the beneficiaries of the competition provided by the private sector nonetheless congress has largely through oversight in my opinion continued the rate regulation of these pipelines when we created the federal energy regulatory commission in public law 9591 we transferred to the department of energy and the ferc the authority to regulate pipelines including petroleum pipelines unfortunately the broad transfer authority included the auaiority to set and prescribe rates or petroleum pipelines back in 1906 whren rate regulation of these pipeline was first established there was sforme justification for it because shipprs had relatively few options availablf to them for transport of their petroleum commodities today however shippers enjoy a great variety of options which include intramodal intermodal and shipper exchanges the recent history of the industry reveals that these options have created competitive pressures resulting in the establishment of fair and equitable prices for shippers and for the ultimate consumers despite this healthy competition and the shipper consumer protection it provides the ferc remains saddled with the responsibility to set rates for this industry almost from its creation the ferc has been struggling with the question of how to set these rates it has yet to come up with a satisfactory answersimply because there is no satisfactory method for setting rates for a competitive industry where there is no need for regulation there is no satisfactory way to regulate i am not calling for the complete de regulation of petroleum pipelines they are common carriers and their obligations as such should continue to be regulated by the ferc the ferc should continue to enforce the legal prescriptions against possible discriminatory or preferential behavior it is only the rate regulation that is unnecessary and it is only that function that i want to extinguish for reasons that i am certain will be brought out at hearings rate regulation discourages competition it imposes an unnecessary burden upon the petroleum pipeline industry

wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the

without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i

measure determine the future course of this nation this administration contends that the american people on november 4 1980 gave ronald reagan a mandate to reduce federal spending cut taxes and slow inflation op february 18 1981 the president reacted to this socalled mandate by producing perhaps the most revolutionary budget document which this nation has ever seen the budget revealed by the presidentnow embodied in the grammlatta substituteprovides millions more for the most prosperous in our nation while pennies are taken away from the poor in the name of 1econamic recovery the budget revealed by the president would pad the pentagon with over 50 billion in new money for ships and other weapons for which we lack the skilled manpower to build and operate in the name of national security the administration budget would take away a 46cent meal from a food stamp recipient household or a ceta job from a high school dropout in the name of reducing inflation it is hard for me to understand the nature of a mandate in which a cold and callous insensitivity for the poor the disadvantaged the handicapped the elderly and the unemployed in our society is disguised as maintaining a social safety net for the truly needy to this date no one in this administration has yet defined this illusory term truly needy i do not believe that the american people mandaited the dismantlement of government by thiq means indeed ihe cbc has met the president headon by accepting his challenge to propose measures which offer a greater chance of balancing the budget reducing and eliminating inflation stimulating the creation of jobs and reducing the tax burden most importantly the cbc substitute accomplishes the economic goals which president reagan purports to address except that we do it with humaneness and compassion our substitute offers a greater chance for addressing the economic ills of this nation time and time again we have heard administration officials members of congress and bureaucrats recite how federal deficit spending causes inflation yet the administration budget or grammlatta substitute provides for a huge 50 billion deficit while the congressional black caucus does not subscribe to the tenet that a deficit creates inflation the cbc substitute amendment provides for a 7 85 billion surplus in fiscal year 1982 in a fiscally sound manner the cbc substitute offers the taxpayers a greater chance by rejecting the reagan administration tax cuts under the reagan plan 19 percent of the taxpayers with iincomes of 30 000 and above receive 61 percent of the tax relief while the 63 percent of the taxpayers with incomes below 20 000 receive only 18 percent of the tax relief the cbc rejects this economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich our substitute takes bold new steps toward innovative and comprehensive tax reforms our substitute offers the largest and fairest tax cut for the working poor and the middle class by increasing the standard deductiontaken by 60 percent of american taxpayersby indexing the tax code to control bracket creep and by increasing the earned income tax credit our substitute provides for a different approach to business incentives to stimulate capital formation and productivity by adopting a firstyear capital cost recovery system for business which has been endorsed by fortune magazine the new york times and the public interest tax research group our substitute generates ovvr 44 billion in additional revenue by ending wasteful and unproductive tax subsidies andl loopholes which only add to the federal deficit the cbc substitute offers the nation a greater chance by reflecting compassion and concern for our most precious resourcethe american people somewhere

streets and see the multitude of our young people who are out of work contrary to some myths this is not because they do not want to work but rather because they lack the training and the opportunities to gain meaningful employment the caucus substitute may mean the difference between thousands of young people wasting their lives away or a cadre of young people who will have the basic

some kind of chronic ailment 10 suffer from impaired vision and 17 have hearing impairment sixteen of every one hundred persons age 65 and older are hospitalized one or more times annually the elderly require three times as many days of hospital care every year as persons under the age of 65 for most of our senior citizens illness strikes most often and with greatest severity at the time in life when incomes are most limited millions of our older citizens cannot afford the health care that they need it is a sad commentary on our society when many of our aged are forced to choose between seeing a doctor or getting a prescription filled or whether they will spend the money for food or warmth the cbc substitute protects funding for medicare since the enactment of medicaid in 1965 life expectancy of all races and sexes has increased and infant mortality rates have decreased clearly the medicaid program has helped nevertheless 23 million black americans still endure poorer health care higher death rates lower life expectancy and a reduced sense of wellbeing than the white population the shocking fact is that only half of the poor people in this country are eligible for medicaid benefits thirteen million children are supposed to receive physical checkups medical and dental care under medicaid yet 1 out of 3 american children has never seen a dentist one in seven has no access to regular health care the caucus substitute protects medicaid benefits for the poor andsick in our society under the grammlatta substitute which incorporates a cap on medicaid spending many states if not most would have to slash medicaid eligibility and benefits in fact many states are already doing so our nation leads the world in terms of biomedical research in fiscal year 1981 we will spend over 3 billion for this purpose yet we still do not have adequate treatment for cancer we have not found a way to cure diabetes we do not know how to prevent a myriad of diseases which cripple

3 percent of lhe nations physicians and dentists and pharmacists less than 4 percent of podiatrists less than 1 percent of veterinarians and optometrists the cbc substitute provides funding for the

education employment income security science and technologybetter than any other proposal before you the caucus substitute offers proof that the budget can be balanced goveminent spending decreased

essential element of our own longterm strategic goals cozy relations with repressive foreign governments can ultimately hurt more than help recent experience demonstrates that victims of repressive governments are not quick to forget unitedstates identification with their former leaders for example our uncritical support pf the authoritarian regime of iranian shah mohammed reza pahlavi alienated

regime is illusory as former secretary of state edmund s muskie said the heavy silence of repression is not stability it is too often the ominous calm before the storm the lesson which this

hope someday this day is forgotten too let me give the members a little history of the process that has gone on around here back about 1971 or 1972 there were a tremendous number of concerned people in americacongressional watchers editorial writers historianswho felt that the thoughts and the ideas of the founding fathers were being violated the founding fathers 200 years ago wrote a constitution in which there would be the equality of a tripartite system the presidency the congress of the united statesthe house and the senateand the judiciary free equal and distinct and they gave to them certain powers the power to declare war was given to the congress of the united states the power over the purse strings was given to the congress of the united states and the power to tax was given to the congress of the united states they were wise in their judgment there were to be two bodies one of which would report home every 2 years with the advent of roosevelt and a rubberstamp congress and the passage of years along the line the power of the congress eroded there was a time when you and i would authorize and appropriate and the president would sign and if he felt like spending the money he spent the money if he did not feel like spending the money he did not there were those who were concerned congressional prerogatives had eroded congress had lost its power and one of those powers related to war we went to vietnam and we lost 50 000 of our finest 150 000 were wounded and we were paying out billions of dollars we were in a war an undeclared war so we put the war powers act through this congress the president may put troops in a country for a period of 30 days but unless there is actic n by this congress those troops must be withdrawn that was in line with the thoughts of the founding fathers on impoundment we put an impoundment control bill through so the president could not just impound now he can rescind or defer subject to the restrictions we are all aware of those laws we have even gone to a onehouse veto in some situations because we thought there was too much regulation when i came here 30 years ago foreign affairs was in the hands of the administration whether or not the founding fathers had intended it we had a bipartisan policy whether it was an eisenhower or a kennedy we followed it but we have drifted away from that because we thought too much power was concentrated in the hands of the president and the powers of the congress were eroding let me tell the members what has developed in the last 4 days i received a telephone call on friday morning from the president of the united states no man living has more respect for that title than i do regardless of who the president is the president said to me i would like to have you go along with the amendments that i am sending over in the package he said the rules committee has been asked by the budget committee to have a closed rule well i said can you be specific well he said there was a meeting last night of jimmy jones and leon panetta with stockman and they were given a sheet of paper on which the amendments were written where we dont think you have gone far enough i think its unfair he said to the republicans for the democratic rules committee to have a closell rule i said mr president i will talk it over with my leadership i called the leadership i called dick bolling in we talked it over truthfully i felt the closed rule was unfair i have been opposed to a closed rule all along even though 80 percent of my party was for a closed rule and now they handed us a package of amendments in my conversation with the president i said mr president you have to be more specific can you outline for me what you have in mind he could not but he said i will send it up he said who shall i send it to i said send it to the rules committee send it to dick bolling about an hour and a half later it came up here we had this sheet of paper on the cuts he wanted because our cuts did not go deep enough i felt as though he wanted those because he truly felt that ours did not go deep enough but to myself i thought he has entertained 66 democrats down there at the white house when he was asked by one member he was told i have more senior citizens and more golden agers and more people on social security than any other section of the country mr president i think your plan goes too far the presidents response to that was do you think that i would hurt the senior citizens of america this is merely a target this is a target and you are going to have your opportunity to vote on the matter now that was said by the pres ent of the united states when he was asked about student aid by another member of the group that was there he said this is merely a target you are going to have your opportunity you know i myself was opposed to the jones bill as it care out it destroys the things that i have been interested in the bills that i really believe in is there a safety net yes i think there is a safety net what is happening to the american public under the democratic bill is that we cut them off at the knees instead of cutting them off at the hip that is about the difference in these bills so i think we were acting in good faith i think this is wrong this process is wrong then what happened that morning we called in bob michel for whom i have had the greatest affection i think he is a great republican leader he had not seen the piece of paper and the amendments that stockman had given to jones and panetta the night before he had not seen it later the white house put into mr bolings hands a threepage document and mr michel had not seen it what i am saying is this bob michel is your elected leader yet he had no knowledge of the package that was being put together he was shown it in the speakers office for the first time now that is the way the administration plays i said to bo bob when the president has remarked that i havent heard back from tip oneill i said no he hasnt heard back from me you are the republican leader and that is the man i will work through when we had formulated the rule i called him in and told him what i had in my mind and what the rules committee had in its mind and what the consensus of members on our side was why do i do that because that is the way the system works i have never seen anything like this in my life to be perfectly truthful what is the authority for this does this mean that any time the president of the united states is interested in a piece of legislation he merely sends it over you do not have any regard for the process for open hearings discussion as to who it affects or what it does to the economy but because a man who does not understand or know our proc ess sends it over are we to take

part of the cleanup activities at the three mile island nuclear powerplant in his announcement the secretary indicted that the administration would request a total of 123 million over the next 3 to 4 years to fund various research and development activities at the damaged generating station this funding would be used to provide technical assistance in the cleanup of the water in the building basement remove and dispose of abnormal wastes riot disposable at commercial sites remove and evaluate the damaged reactor core and develop special tooling needed for early access for several reasons i believe it would be unwise and inappropriate to support this program at this time along with my fellow members of the committee on science and technology i have always strongly supported our nations efforts to become energy independent our inability and unwillingness to face our energy problems in the last 7 years has had many serious repercussions the energy crisis has drained the financial strength of our country and seriously threatens our national security events make it imperative that we press forward with the development of our domestic epergy resources we must now take advantage of the potential billions of barrels of oil shale tar sands and heavy oil deposits and the vast abundance of coal reserves which lie in our country the science committee has heard a great deal of encouraging testimony of the unlimited potential of these and other inexhaustible energy resources such as solar and fusion energy it is certainly i our nations best interests to continue to pursue the development of these various energy resources however regardless of what role nuclear fission should play in our future energy mix there are several compelling reasons why the federal government should not support the cleanup of the damaged three mile island tmi reactor unit first and foremost funding a tmi research and development program would be incompatible with the administrations energy philosophy this philosophy rests on the basic premise that the federal government should only support longrange highrisk research and development activities the administration believes that the federal government should not compete with industry in the development and commercialization of energy technologies which have already proven to be viable and are either in the marketplace or near commercialization this cleanup program would particularly be at odds with this philosophy it seems clear that the 70 or more nuclear plants in commercial operation today make nuclear power a commercial technology the record of commercial nuclear power is well known given the specific circumstances surrounding the tmi accident it is even more clear that the financial responsibility for this mishap must rest with those who produced and used the electric power this has been the case in other circumstances such as the nuclear regulatory commission levying a fine on a nuclear utility for an infraction of its regulations according to the report of the presidents commission on the accident at three mile island the kemeny report the opu service corporation qpusc has final responsibility for the design of the plant however by its own account it lacked the staff or expertise in certain areas to discharge that responsibility once construction was complete gpusc turned the plant over to met ed metropolitan edison company the operator and part owner of the three mile island nuclear powerplant to run but met ed did not have sufficient knowledge expertise and personnel to operate the plant or maintain it adequately the kemeny report goes on further to f ind thatin conclusion while the major factor that turned this incident into a serious accident was inappropriate operator action many factors contributed to the action of the operators such as deficiencies in their training lack of clarity in their operating procedures failure of organizations to learn the proper lessons from previous incidents and deficiencies in the design of the control room these shortcomings are attributable to the utility to suppliers of equipment and ito the federal commission that regulates nuclear power thereforegiven ail the above deficiencies we are convinced that an accident like three mile island was eventually inevitable based upon this report the utility certainly had responsibility for this most unfortunate accident and i believe they should be held strictly accountable my second concern with this research and development program is with the funding implications that would result budgetary pressures have presented the congress this fiscal year with many hard choices especially in the energy area the recent increases in inflation and our overall economic situation have made it painfully clear to us that our nation is in the midst of severe and deep economic troubles while recognizing that an effective energy research and development program is in our best national interests i believe that it is obvious that drastic action is necessary to get the economy back under control this action must include reductions in federal spending and every agency and every program will have to take its fair share of cuts no matter how attractive the individual activities sound on their own merits in light of these concerns i have supported the energy program approved by the science committee that calls for an aggressive effort in all of our nations energy research and development programs overall the committee authorized over 1 56 billion for nuclear energy r d compared to 1 02 billion for fossil solar geothermal lowhead hydrotpower and conservation research and development programs we also authorized funding for many other important energy programs including 376 million for the state and local conservation grant programs and other conservation activities our energy programs will certainly face close scrutiny in the years ahead and many more tough funding decisions will have to be made it would be a mistake to tip this balance toward one energy form or another taking into account our severe budget constraints i do not believe that we can afford to commit ourselves to this new nuclear program and still be able to maintain a wellbalanced energy program that will allow us to fully take advantage of all of our domestic energy resources while it is apparent that the federal government cannot and should not directly support the cleanup of this tragic accident all would agree that there is still an urgent need to proceed with the cleanup of this accident in the most expeditious manner possible public health and safety are in jeopardy as long as this plant remains contaminated in this regard i believe that there are several other viable options available to help us proceed with this task one possible option that has been suggested would be the establishment of a national insurance program for nuclear powerplant property this option would help us avoid any government bailout for the cleanup of nuclear accidents and apportion the costs of any such accident on an equitable basis to those who really benefit from this activity i would encourage my colleagues to consider this possibility as well as other alternative solutions as we face this important nuclear issue in the months ahead our budget

we are committed to a balanced budget and we passed a law to that extent what i have been doing day after day over some weeks on the house floor is pointing out hopefully to members of congress that we are indeed responsible for that law that we passed if we do not like the law then i would say to the members who want to vote against that law come out and repeal it but i think it is disgusting

debate will not degenerate to one of semantics if we are to see the goal of improved acquisition processes then the department of defense must have maximum flexibility consistent with sound business practices this does not mean that we should shirk or even lessen our oversight responsibilities under secretary carlucci has made improvements in the acquisition process a top priority at the department of defense as a former businessman i can tell you that i am impressed with the businesslike approach he and his associates are taking multiyear procurement is not the beall and endall of defense contracting it is a tool and our committee thinks a useful one for solving some special problems what are these problems first and foremost there is instability in the procurement process no company is going to bid on government contracts when it does not know from one year to the next whether the contract will continue or at what level far better from a companys standpoint to seek out and compete for commerical contracts where price competitiveness is the only consideration where it will not be plagued by paperwork second there are problems with longleadtime elements these can be stockedbought at the best price and worked into production as needed this is no small consideration either to the contractor the agency or the taxpayer leadtimes for components made from strategic minerals grow progessively worse for titanium sheet and plate it is 88 weeks for aluminum forgings it is some 118 weeks for every strategic metal or mineral you can name there is an accompanying horror story then there is the lack of skilled personnel in many crafts there is or will be shortages with or without increased defense production stable orders can provide the incentive to train the people who will be needed not just for the defense industry but for the entire economy and finally there is the shrinking industrial base multiyear contracting can improve competition a stable contract encompassing several years will beyond question serve to lure potential suppliers to bid on contracts and especially subcontracts it has been reporled to the panel which examined our defense industrial base last year that in just one construction program the prior pool of 6 000 contractors shrunk to 1 500 in 1 year did these 4 500 companies just go out of business it is not likely what is likely is that they simply did not bid on defense business multiyear contracting will not get us weapons systems at fire sale prices but it can help to get us weapons systems in a timely manner at a price the taxpayer can and will support the committee has limited the authority to enter into multiyear contracts as authorized in section 909 of the bill to cases where funds are otherwise available for obligation the committee adopted this laniguage to make clear that section 909 does not by itself provide contract authority rather the authority to enter into contracts is provided subject to funds being available for obligation through other actions of the congress or other provisions of law in adopting this language the committee did not intend to restrict the authority to enter into multiyear contracts solely to those cases where funds are appropriated for that purpose on the contrary the committee envisions that funds could be available for obligation for a multiyear contract from for example annually made appropriations including funds made available through reprograrning or transfer proceeds from sales of goods and services which under current provision of law would be available for obligation and funds available for obligation in connection with foreign military sales the committee in recommending section 909 does not believe that funding for the entire term of a multiyear contract is necessary under the defense acquisition procedures that have been in effect for many years the department of defense does not fund items being purchased during all the program years covered by the multiyear contract rather dod obligates funds under a contract for items being purchased during the first program year when the contract is entered into and subsequently funds items being purchased under the contract for each subsequent program year of procurement when those funds have been appropriated for that year the government is not obligated to pay the contractor for subsequent program years nor is the contractor obligated to proceed for subsequent program years until the funds have been appropriated and the contractor has been advised that those funds are available for contract performance under section 909 that practice could continue the committee expects that section 909 in conjunction with other applicable provisions of law would allow the department of defense to enter into a contract which provides for the initial program year and for up to 5 program years with funds available for obligation in an amount sufficient only for the first year plus any termination liability provided for under the contract the contract may include a cancellation ceiling which would set a ceiling on those amounts that the government would owe the

title v were further heartened by the actions taken by our colleagues in the senate on july 1 on a similar resolution senate resolution 340 by a resounding 89 to 6 vote the senate voted to oppose any actions which would terminate or otherwise weaken the program the title v program has proven its worth many times over for it keeps older workers as taxpaying citizens rather than forcing them into dependency it has promoted selfsufficiency for its participants as well as ageintegrated services to the communities where it operates this program has also shattered the antiquated myth that older

conference report and urge its passage this bill has passed the house overwhelmingly on two occasions i am pleased to speak now on the successful conclusion of a very confused and unusual legislative course much of the departure from the normal process has been over a nongermane amendment about the public health service commission corps added to this bill by the other body after two meetings between the house and the senate conferees on this particular item it became clear that the amendment added in the other body was so flawed in its language that its legal effects were limited to persons already members of the corps and did not reach persons not already in the corps the cash discount act h r 31 originated in the house banking committee it passed the house on february 24 1981 it was amended on the senate floor with a nongermane amendment to the public health service act which is within the jurisdiction of the committee on energy and commerce when returned to the house the speaker referred the nongermane amendment to our committee until april 8 the health subcommittee held a hearing but the deputy assistant secretary of health and human services whose responsibilities include the service refused to testify this committee took no further action within the time allotted on april 8 the house asked for a conference on h r 31 and appointed conferees the senate appointed conferees on april 29 the senates amendment to the health act makes two related but permanent changes in law the first amends section 204 to authorize appointment of a person as surgeon general who is 64 or older the second waives the mandatory retirement provision of the act for the surgeon general only i wish to point out that last february the departments assistant general counsel was asked whether it would be permissible to make an original appointment in the regular corps of a person over age 64 in a memorandum opinion dated february 9 1981 the answer was an unequivocal no the general counsel said that section 207 a 3 of the actprohibits appointment in the regular corps or call to active duty in the reserve corps of a person age 44 or over unless he has had the number of years of prior service by which his age exceeds 44 or the secretary determines that he possesses exceptional qualifications not readily available in the corps for the performance of special duties with the service also he pointed out that section 211 a requires mandatory retirement of commissioned officers at age 64 the general counsel concluded even though the appointment limitation may be waived in an appropriate case there is no authority to waive the mandatory retirement provision the only provision for active duty after age 64 is the provision in section 211 c for recall to active duty in a retired status to appoint an individual who is subject to immediate retirement on the theory that he could then be recalled under section 211 c would be an obvious attempt to circumvent the requirement of the statute and would frustrate the intent of congress in imposing maximum retirement and appointment ages as you kiow there are comparable provisions in the other uniformed services as well as in the civil service and we are unaware of successful challenge to those provisions another provision of law requires an examination for persons appointed to the corps above the grade of junior assistant the president however may waive this to appoint with consent of the senate a limited number of persons between the grades of senior assistant and director dr julius richmond the former surgeon general received such an appointment however he was under the retirement age i agree withthe departments general counsel i also observe that 31 unitedstatesc 82c provides that a certifying officer is held accountable for and required to make good to the united states the amount of any illegal payment prohibited by law payment of anysalary to a person who does not meet the requirements of law if he were to be appointed surgeon general with the enactment of h r 31 only would be prohibited by law senate confirmation could not correct this because of the house instructions referred to in the conference report the conferees could make these other changes needed to appoint dr koop because as congressman madigan observed at the time of the house instruction they exceed the scope of conference and violate house rules therefore even though we were instructed by the house to agree in conference to the senate language and in fact did agree to the senate language in this conference report i want to inform the members of this house that the senate language did not accomplish what the authors of that proposal sought to accomplish it is my intention as chairman of the subcommittee on health and the environment which has jurisdiction over this matter to schedule hearings before our subcommittee on additional legislation that has been proposed by our colleague from illinois mr hyde on this subject soon after we return from the july 4 recess so we can consider further the issues involved i want to take this opportunity to compliment our colleague from illinois"],

a cftc some 8 years ago there were only 17 people down in what was called the cea in the department of agriculture the industry was just about to explode the administration at that time did not think there was any need at all to get concerned they did not see this explosion coming on but in fact there has been an explosion even beyond what those of us who saw it coming had anticipated it has now become an important financial tool to the united states of america and this is a very important bill i thank the gentleman from texas and the others on the committee for having proceeded diligently with this bill this year i hope that the gentleman will accept the amendment the amendment provides that an insider cannot trade futures on his own account the sec does not permit insiders to do so but it is not a violation of commodities law an insider is defined in one paragraph and the other paragraph says those insiders cannot trade it would prohibit the officers of corporations that have access to their companys future trading information from trading on their own account some companies prohibit that it is really a conflict of interest to do it but some companies do not prohibit it it also prohibits those brokers that handle those kinds of trades from trading on their own we had a study in the small business committee and found out that out of 1 027 big traders there were 80 insiders the 80 insiders made 100 million of the 155 million that was on the profit side during a 16month period when 80 out of 1 027 make twothirds of the profits on the profit side during that period it raises questions especially when they have information about big traders positions they have an advantage insiders just should not be in the market at all some companies prohibit their officers from trading on their own in commodities the company is trading in i think they all should so what the amendment would do here is just say that like with the sec insiders should not be trading in futures at all"]]}
