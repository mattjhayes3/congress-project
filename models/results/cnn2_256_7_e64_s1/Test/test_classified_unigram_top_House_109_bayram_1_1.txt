express my deep concerns and ask for a colloquy with the chairman we are not paying enough attention to the northern border of the united states unless they represent the border states like minnesota some members may not realize that the unitedstates canada border is over 4 000 miles long and consists of over 430 official and unofficial ports of entry however even with recent staffing moves moves that i commend the customs and border patrol has only 1 000 agents along the northern border that compares to over 10 000 agents on the border which is half the length of the unitedstates canada border this staffing shortage along the northern border poses a real security threat in fact due to the shortage the department of homeland security has looked for new ways to monitor the canadian border such as a new proposed requirement for passports to get back and forth across the border unfortunately anyone who has spent time up north knows this will not accomplish much to deter or prevent illegal activities or to secure the border simply put the canadian border is just too vast for such an approach to work with many unmanned check points in remote areas i know from personal stories that at some of these unmanned crossings people have to wait an hour or more before a border patrol agent can come to lift up the gate so they can cross we do not expect al qaeda and narcotics traffickers to wait an hour for the border patrol to show up at the check point we have already recognized in numerous laws that hightech border surveillance must be integrated into the manpower and resources we have up there to get real control over our borders in the prior years defense authorization act in the prior years homeland security appropriations act and in this years intelligence reform act congress recognized the need to develop hightech border surveillance however what little progress the department of homeland security has made on this front has been entirely confined to the southern border even with the 10 million appropriated in this bill last year this is unacceptable we simply are not paying enough attention to the northern border some think the southern border is more dangerous but i remind my colleagues that terrorists will attack us through the path of least resistance i believe it is critical that the funds allocated to the custon and border patrol accounts used to pay muchneeded research and survey technology including unmanned aerial vehicles be not solely devoted to the southern border but also to the northern border to stretch the resources our custom and border patrol manpower has i ask that the gentleman from kentucky work with me to ensure that there is sufficient resources in the bill and in the conference report to address these issues and that it be applied not just to the southern border but to the northern border as well"], [0.0023461580276489258, 0.5023461580276489, 1, "thank you and a very special thankyou to my very good friehd from california tom lantos for his leadership on this issue i rest better at night knowing that he is our leader and i am very proud of him and very delighted to be here today i i am not going to take all of the time which is uncharacteristic for me i just couldnt have a resolution of this magnitude on the floor of the house without coming here and lending support two minutes could never be enough for me to speak on this issue and i am afraid even 2 hours might not be long enough for me to express my feelings and my views i grew up in a family where the very existence of israel changed our lives i was born in my grandmothers apartment on the lower east side of new york and grew up hearing stories of what their lives were like in europe before they came to this country and how important israel was to the survival of the jewish people and while the jewish people were people of the diaspora and had managed to survive without a nation for 5 000 years the very existence of israel gave each of us a tremendous sense of confidence and wellbeing knowing that we had a homeland of our own i was not alive in the 1948 war or the 1956 when israel was attacked again by its arab neighbors 1967 i was more aware and 1973 of course what i find incomprehensible and something i simply cannot understand that here we are so many years after the creation of israel after the aftermath of the holocaust and the very reasons that israel was established and we are still debating throughout the world whether israel has a right to exist i am so proud of my colleagues for introducing this resolution i think it strikes the exact right note at the exact right time in our worlds history we cannot allow this to continue israel has a right to exist have secure borders and lead a life for its citizens and i think the time has come for the world body led by the united states of america to step up to the plate and say enough is enough and this resolution is a remarkably good start i thank everybody for supporting it i am very proud of the speeches tlfat my colleagues have made and i look forward to voting for this and i urge all of my colleagues to do the same i rise in strong support for the resolution the current crisis in the middle east was caused by an unnecessary ill advised and unprovoked attack on israel by hamas and hezbollah by terrorist organizations who have called for the elimination of israel there are victims of these terrorist attacks innocent israeli soldiers and citizens and there are perpetrators of these terrorist attackshamas and hezbollah there is no moral equivalency in this struggle to those who incomprehensibly condemn israel or who attempt to find some equivalency let me state the obvious every sovereign nation has a right and responsibility to protect and defend its people for those who think that israel overreactedif i was the mother of a 19yearold soldier peacefully guarding my countrys border and my son was kidnapped by a terrorist organization i would expect my govemment to do everything in its power to bring my boy home an israeli mother should expect and get no less if i was living on the border of my country and a terrorist group was continuously lobbing rockets into my town where i live where my children play i would demand that my country do whatever they had to to eliminate the threatisrael should there should be no mistake about who is behind this crisis iran and syria irans president pledged to wipe israel off the map and he refers to israel as an illegitimate nation syrias troops occupied southern lebanon illegally until 2005 this is a strictly defensive action on the part of israel there is an internationally recognized border with lebanon israel unilaterally completed its withdrawal from lebanon over 6 years ago for 6 years the lebanese government has done nothing to stepin and establish control over part of its country they did nothing and left a power vacuum filled by hezbollah in the southern third of lebanon hezbollah uses southern lebanon to lob katusha rockets into israel with the hope of killing someone killing anyone they are not there to build a nation protecting a people laying a foundation for a better lebanonthey are there to kill israelis israel did everything it could possibly do to avoid a conflict in lebanonasking time and again that the government of lebanon take control and police their territory unfortunately these requests went unanswered and the terrorism continued to grow on its border with gaza israel also faces unrelenting terrorist attacks after years of waiting and praying and hoping for a peace partner israel chose to unilaterally withdraw from gaza it uprooted families who created beautiful settlements these families built homes from nothing farms from dirt three generations were removed some focibly from the only homes they had ever known i know i was there i saw israeli soldiers carrying jewish settlers in their arms across the border out of gaza there were tears in the eyes of the settlers and there were tears in the eyes of the soldiers one would have thought that the palestinians would have used this opportunity to demonstrate to the world that they were capable of selfgovernance instead of building homes schools and infrastructure they have used gaza to launch thousands of kassam rockets at innocent israelis the international community must ensure that hamas and hezbollah are disarmed the international community must ensure that iran and syria end their support for hezbollahs and hamass terrorism hamas must renounce its charter that calls for the destruction of the state of israel or be cut off from the rest of the world syria and iran must be punished for their support of hezbollah the 3 israeli soldiers must be returnedalive and unharmed congress must pass this resolution condemning the attacks on israelthey are indefensible and unacceptableand supporting its unconditional right to defend

small businesses and associations to band together to purchase health insurance coverage for their workers and their families the small business health fairness act can directly benefit the over 2 300 small businesses and associations in my congressional district and their employees h r 525 would allow ahps and small businesses to be certified under one fedelal law instead of 50 different state regulations like large employers and labor unions that offer health insurance to their employees and members ahps would be regulated by the unitedstates department of labor many opponents of the small business health fairness act claim that ahps will cherry pick and therefore only benefit healthy people this is not true all ahps must comply with the health insurance portability and accountability act which prohibits group plans from excluding highrisk individuals that have required repeated health insurance claims h r 525 also guarantees that only bona fide professional and trade associations can sponsor an ahp this measure ensures that ahps will undergo a strict new certification process before they will be allowed to offer health benefits to employers this new certification process includes stronger solvency standards including stoploss and indemnification insurance studies have shown that ahps would save the typical small business owner between 15 percent and 30 percent on health insurance currently there are 45 million americans who are uninsured even more troubling is the fact that 60 percent of uninsured americans work for small businesses that lack the resources to provide health care benefits to their workers in fact 65 percent of smallbusiness owners indicate high cost as the main reason why they do not offer health insurance small employers are facing 50 percent premium hikes even as many insurers are leaving the small group market because it is not profitable enough the time to offer small businesses and associations the ability to band together to offer health insurance to their employees is now the small business health fairness act represents a first step in helping to lower the number of uninsured americans many of whom work for small

at every single step and that increases prices at the street corner my amendment is very straightforward it directs the comptroller general to study the effects of consolidation on prices on market economics and small business ownership most people who live in a community for a long time are accustomed to talking about their local service station where they know their mechanic and their owner where they know the prices but those days are in the past now their local facility is controlled by a giant corporation which has gobbled up their local facility and lower prices on the street corner have also become a thing of the past in 2002 the senate committee on government reform permanent subcommittee on investigations studied consolidation of fuel refineries the subcommittees findings are now over 3 years old and are alarming in their prescience as the report indicated corporate interests are dominating pricing controlling the market and pricing out privately owned retail outlets corporations are earning windfall profits while privately owned stations are struggling to keep afloat the subcommittee did not focus on wholesale and retail consolidation this amendment would achieve

i think that we need to set the record straight as exactly what this house has done regarding that issue because the issue has been around some time before we went on our district work period in august the week before we left at the end of july this house did pass did pass and sent over to the senate an increase in the minimum wage yes it was attached to other bills or other issues that is not anything that is unusual in this body that goes on all of the time but what were those other issues those other issues provided tax relief for certain americans one of that was sales tax deductibility for example for states that do not have an income tax my state happens to be one of those broad support in both houses of the congress the other was the not the elimination but capping of the death tax that has support in both houses it unfortunately does not have the required filibusterproof support in the other body but that was part of that tax bill there is also a provision for research and development tax credits to keep our economy moving that has broad support in both houses that was part of that tax bill and then there were some other provisions in that also attached to that yes was the minimum wage i voted for that i have to say i am not one that is generally in favor of the minimum wage but i felt coupling that together with these other important measures have failed for example to enact riskto keep our economy going to take based first responder funding as a recare of those taxpayers in states that sult washington and new york areas do not enjoy broad parity with other we know the terrorists still want to atstates i thought it was important tack will still be vulnerable so if the issue then is to pass a min congress has done even worse on imum wage
