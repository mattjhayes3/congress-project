entitled to sit here even though the house later turned them out however we should remember those days and the people who were heavily involved especially the africanamericans of mississippi and

women have meant to other women who are struggling even now for their full place in our society and when the gentlewoman invited us to design our remarks around a role model i did not have to think long immediately there came into my mind a woman who i regard as one of my mentors her name is fannie lou hamer fannie lou hamer had 6 years of education i have a law degree and masters degree and yet it is fannie lou hamer who taught me and mentored me evei though i do not believe that she understood or particularly believed that she was a mentor it was not a word in fannie lou hamers vocabulary i met fannie lou hamer as a law student when i was part of the student nonviolent coordinating committee in the deep south who is fannie lou hamer why should she mean anything to women or to anyone in this chamber fannie lou hamer is dead now she died of cancer in the 1980s she was the youngest of 20 children born in the mississippi delta loved it to her dying day one of the great stories of the civil rights movement of any race of any gender i say to my colleagues if you were to remember her for her stated accomplishments you would have to remember that she helped form the delta ministry the community development program in the delta of mississippi but she would probably be most remembered for cofounding the mississippi freedom democratic party i ultimately became associated with that party that simply wanted to be a part of the democratic party i helped write the brief and fannie lou hamer and others from mississippi came to atlantic city in 1964 to say to their party open the party to everybody we are democrats we want to be democrats ultimately a compromise was reached to allow two members of the delegation to sit the challenge was to the mississippi delegation itself what was won however was a pledge from the national democratic party to seek delegations that included black delegates and that i might add has become a bipartisan pledge because as a result of the work of the mississippi freedom democratic party and fannie lou hamer no political party in the united states will ever exclude people based on race again indeed fannie lou hamer came as a delegate 4 years later in 1968 to the democratic national convention in chicago fannie lou hamer was in my estimation the mother of all role models the best role models are those who do not try to become or pretend to be or hold themselves out to be i first met her in 1963 when i was sent to fetch her from a jail in winona ms having just arrived fresh bushytailed and wideeyed from law school in the delta at a time when to say the least it was one of the closed parts of american society fannie lou hamer had come home from a conference gone into a bus station to use the facilities and promptly had been arrested they then proceeded to beat mrs hamer as was the custom in the mississippi of the day lawrence guyot who now lives here in the district of columbia and was then a sncc member went the 9 miles to get her and they put him in jail and began to beat him too here comes eleanor holmes norton then eleanor catherine holmes from washington dc sent down to try out a version of the freedom schools for which the summer of 1964 was to become known in history this of course was 1963 law student that i was i inquired before i went over of the nearby police chief of the matter and indicated to him that i had phoned everybody in the north they knew i was going and i did not intend to be jailed i asked him to call over to winona to tell him i was coming the long and short of that was unlike fannie lou hamer i was not beaten and we got her out of jail she became a legend and is in the class of harriet tubman sojourner truth and of mary mcleod bethune she is at one with jane adams margaret sanger and eleanor roosevelt as an inspirational speaker she was in a class with martin luther king jr himself she worked in the cotton fields for 18 years until sncc came into mississippi she was old enough to be our mother but she decided she wanted to go to vote too particularly since the literacy test was the reason that blacks could not vote in the delta as a matter of fact the plantation owner where fannie lou hamer had begun working before she was 6 years old recognized by the time she was 6 that she could read and she became a timekeeper on the plantation so fannie lou hamer knew she could read and went to register when she registered the man who owned the plantation where she was a sharecropper said to her that she must either withdraw her registration or leave the plantation that was no hobsons choice for fannie lou hamer after 18 years knowing how to do nothing but pick cotton or so she thought she left the plantation she and her husband what they endured for the years following was nothing short of terrorism on and off sometimes in the day sometimes in the night this woman of little schooling was a lady of very great talent analytical oratorical talent with the ability to somehow make us understand where we must go she was a woman of great love however always profoundly black always reaching out to the poor whites in her native sunflower county indeed the ultimate vindication of fannie lou hamers life is the cooperative farm where she started to raise animals and vegetables for the poor blacks and poor whites in sunflower county fannie lou hamer lived to see what i thought i would never see and that is that her native town ruleville ms actually declared a fannie lou hamer day blacks and whites in the mississippi delta who had lived together and lived apart all of their days gathered round this extraordinary woman that she lived to see it is what is most important she stood for strength and humor and love and the most determined honesty she is remembered for her extraordinary speech on the floor of the 1964 convention declaring that she was sick and tired of being sick and tired so all over america today people are heard to say they are sick and tired of being sick and tired not all of them however come in the spirit of fannie lou hamer who paraphrased the words of john f kennedy one day and said ask not what your movement can do for you ask what you can do for your movement so for those who did not have the great and enormous pleasuriof seeing or knowing fannie lou hamer understand how she would have approached the predicament of women and of people of color today not in hatred ever she was a woman of profound love not with finger pointing but with that extraordinary skill that somehow brings your adversary to you would that there were more fannie lou hamers in the america divided by race that seems to have lost that magic moment in the 1960s when we all believed it could be one people one nation we have got to get back to that even without fannie lou hamer with only her indomitable spirit and memory fannie lou hamer will be remembered as long as the civil rights cataclysm of the 1960s is remembered she will be remembered for running to sit in this house of representatives as an active protest she was not even allowed on the ballot she will be remembered for sitting in that balcony when she challenged the delegation from the state of mississippi that delegation now more than most in this country reflects finally begins to reflect what fannie lou hamer stood for the mississippi democratic party that excluded her is now the most integrated democratic party in the united states of america mississippi has sent a black man here who served on the same committee with the dean of the delegation mr wmtten i am sorry that fannie lou hamer did not live to see that for that indeed was her goal even as she challenged the mississippi delegation in this house march 16 1993 so much that mrs hamer stood for has indeed come to pass when we are demoralized and believe that somehow the progress that we knew in the 1960s and 1970s cannot return much less be improved we ought to remember where we started and particularly where women like fannie lou hamer startednowhere with nothing fannie lou hamer will be remenibered always for a principled ideology that was never faddish always encompassing all people yet profoundly militant rooted in the necessity of struggle i shall always remember her for the song she used to lead us in in the churches of the south where we would gather every night to sing to pray to plan near the end of every night meeting the time would be reserved for mrs hamer and she would rise to somehow sum it up and pull it all together what a speech she could have made in this house of representatives at the end of these extraordinary speeches full of love full of struggle somehow with a perfect balance between the two after she had finished what she had to say after we had been brought to our feet with the inspiration that she had to give she would break out into what became her theme song fannie lou hamer we remember every time we sing it anywhere the tune is

applaud the leadership of the ranking member the gentleman from texas loth preceding speakers mentioned bob woodwards recent book in that book mr woodward says that president clinton called his own tax plan a turkey well the president apparently knows a turkey when he sees one and that bird has now come home to roost the presidents hightax highregulation policies are an albatross around our struggling economy i think the anniversary of the presidents tax plan that we are marking today provides an excellent occasion to show through a frank and honest discussion of the results of this tax hike the largest tax hike in the history of our country that hightax policies do not promote sustained economic growth in fact theycannot promote sustained economic growth the president as has been explained has been the beneficiary of a normal business cycle recovery i think we all agree on that the recovery albeit it a weak one was well nderway before president clinton assumed office and it is interesting to note that economic growth has actually slowed since his inauguration let me explain the last recession the bush recession officially ended in march 1991 substantial growth then began in 1992 in 1993 after president linton was inaugurated we aw growth slow abruptly in the first half of the year and then surge at the end of the year but despite strong fourthquarter growth in 1993 annual growth in 1992 outpaced that of 1993 so it is disingenuous at best for the clinton administration to claim credit for an upswing in the business cycle that was clearly in place before mr clinton became president we all remember how our friends on the other side of the aisle claimed at least some of them that this largest tax increase in history would send a szinal that washington was serious about deficit reduction we remember how they said this would result in a steep drop in interest rates let us look at what has happened bond yields began rising shortly after the tax bill was signed tenyear treasury bonds rose from 5 3 percent in september 1993 to 7 3 percent this past july yet even with these increased rates the dollar continues to fall the continuing fall of the dollar in world markets shows that the recent increase in interest rates both by the federal revenue and the markets have not restored confidence 4n the stability of the dollar all of us should be concerned that this freefall further damages longterm economic prosperity for all americans we look back to president carters economic policies because they clearly illustrated the presumed tradeoff between inflation and unemployment that that tradeoff is nonexistent both of these harmful economic results can and will unfortunately coexist with inflation now as the gentleman from texas explained so well in clear view we face the real possibility of returning to the glory days socalled facetiously of jimmy carter we all remember the phrases malaise the misery index readings and stagflation i am afraid we are headed that way again if we do not change the economic policy of this country economists agree our economy should grow and this is a consensus among leading economists from both political parties and of all ideologica3 stripes leading economists agree our economy should grow at 4 percent a year on average in real terms with price stability while the economy has been growing at an annual rate of about 4 percent for the three quarters that growth has been atificially stimulated by an easy money ypolicy that will launch us right back into carter style economics even the president is skeptical of longterm economic growth the q mbs midsession review of the budget forecasts growth at below 2 7 percent in 1995 and next year and beyond 1995 1996 and 1997 as well omb forecasts in fact project average annual real economic growth at only 2 6 percent between 1994 and 1999 a 5year period of growth and teal economic growth 2 6 percent that should concern all of us the american people cannot afford or do they deserve this kind of stagnation this kind of slow growth we all know that the vaunted clinton recovery is the weakest in the last 50 years the weakest of any of the seven postworld war ii recoveries in fact since world war ie the unitedstates economy has traditionally averaged 5 3 percent annual growth for the 3 years following the end of a recession the current recovery though has only averaged 2 9 percent in the last 2 years which is far below the average of the previous seven world war ii recoveries in fact growth during the expansion has not even reached the average of 3 1 percent for all years since world war i1 that is including the recession years economist lawrence kudlow recently estimated that our gross domestic product would have grown by an additional l1 trillion and over 5 5 million new jobs would have been created if the economy had simply grown at the postwar average mr speaker we must look seriously at the reasons why our economy cannot shake off its doldrums it seems to most of us on this side of the aisle that the clear reason is the clinton high tax high regulation high spending policies are a heavy anchor on the economy and it is time to cut this anchor loose economist larry kudlow calls the difference between the weak economic growth we are now experiencing and the economic vigor seen in past recoveries the performance gap clearly the clinton tax increases have made a significant contribution to the performance gap they have taken money out of the productive capitalinvesting sector of our economy and given it to the inefficient bureaucrats here in washington but the real problem is the absence of the progrowth reforms our economy so badly needs we need a capital gains tax cut to stimulate investment and job creation we need to look no further back than president kennedys era and look at what president kennedy said and did in terms of cutting capital gains and look at the job creation and the economic growth that was resultant from that capital gains cut we also need to lower burdensome regulations which are increasingat the highest rate since the carter years regulations are killing our small business sector which creates 85 percent of the jobs for the american working people we must review and reduce the burdensome regulationson the entrepreneurs of this country and above all we need a rational tax policy that quits penalizing the productive and rewarding the parasites working with those of us who understand that economic growth comes from the private sector nor from expanding government this administration can close that performance gap congress and the president now need to work together to get the real economic growth the real job growth that this country

other peaceful demonstration protected by the first amendment it says so explicitly in the act comparisons to the civil rights movement are in the words of usa today grotesque rhetorical gargle and outrageous this bill is also not about the first amendment nor about political correctness it is about fighting domestic terrorism shootings arson vandalism firebombings and chemical attacks are not the tools of civil opposition nor even civil disobedience state and local governments have not been able to protect our citizens and if our citizens cannot live without fear of bodily harm without fear of violence and intimidation while they exercise their rights whether in earning a legal living or in exercising their right to choose then federal action becomes necessary earlier this year i

hurt the middleclass american and ruin small businesses or that this is the only time in unitedstates history that tax increases have been effective retroactively all of these assertions are demonstrably false the 1982 tax increase was actually larger in real dollar terms no american who eams less than 180 000 a year will have their income taxes raised and only 4 percent of small businesses will be affected by the income tax increase when we shine the light of day on the spectres raised by the opponents of this package they vanish into thin air the true facts regarding the conference report on h r 2264 are that it is a serious attempt at deficit reduction with realistic plans based on a balance between real spending cuts and targeted revenue increases many members who have risen to voice their opposition to this package were here during the last 12 years or continually and rapidly escalating budget deficits many of these members have paid lip service to the cause

afternoon on the elementary and secondary education act one of the issues in which the house spoke loudly and clearly during our earlier consideration was the right of school children to participate in what is called constitutionally permitted school prayer the distinguished gentlemen from texas offered an amendment at that time that if members recall i was one of those who spoke in favor of the amendment at that time because i though it was important that we understand exactly what we mean by constitutionally permitted school prayer everyone has assumed that somehow under the establishment clause of the constitution that school prayer is not constitutionally permitted however the american law division has made it very clear that constitutionally permitted school prayer would include first and foremost a moment of silence which students can use for that purpose and second such activities as graduation ceremony prayers if offered by a member of the student body i would hope that there is none among us who believe that that is in any way shape or form coercion but rather would recognize that as the legitimate rights of students in our society as the american law division wrote in their ruling they said the students of this country do not shed their first amendment rights to free speech at the schoolhouse door what we would like to do is make sure that no funds are in any way shape or form used to prohibit the rights of schools to have school prayer and go on beyond that to say that we are not going to allow any kind of funds from the federal government to schools that have policies which specifically prohibit school prayer this is where the importance of this motion to instruct comes in because the senate has language which in all due respect to my colleagues in the senate makes it impossible to ever enforce the right of constitutionally permitted school prayer the senate language says that any state or local agency local school that is adjudged by a federal court to have willfully violated a federal court order mandating such constitutionally permitted school prayer would be denied funds the facts are ladies and gentlemen to go through that kind of a not one but double legal hurdle guarantees that in effect we would never enforce the provision allowing constitutionally permitted school prayer i call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reaffirm what was a strong vote on this issue earlier in our consideration so that as we go to conference this is an issue we may bring back ta members in its proper form"], [0.8860946968197823,

involved in that people will go to great lengths to demonstrate their involvement and their commitment to among them is the prolife cause prolife people believe in the very fiber of their being that what is going on in an abortion clinic is the same thing that went on at buchenwald dachau auschwitz innocent human lives are being destroyed they feel so strongly about that that they are willing to put their own physical bodies on the line stand in front of pickets and pray and protest and hand out leaflets and pamphlets and some of them go so far as to sit in physically now i do not condone

what the ways and means committee offered as a member of the ways and means committee and as a new member it was an enlightening process for me because it was a very important tax bill to comes before the american people first i would like to talk about the question of fairness and the openness of the process by which we bring this matter before the full house hopefully this thursday to begin with people have been debating taxes and the federal deficit throughout the campaigns of 1992 and obviously into this legislative session so it is not a new issue that comes before the house in addition specifically on this bill members have debated among themselves in committee on the various positions of deficit reduction and funding the budget package in addition it is a bit ironic to hear members talk about the fact that we may have only 1 day of debate on this piece of legislation as they debate the legislation here before the house in the procedure we know as special orders any member can come before the house of course and ask for time and generally receive the time that they wish in order to make public their views on this very important issue of deficit reduction and economic stimulus for this nation so americans should keep in mind this process that it is with a bit of tongueincheek that members come before the house and criticize the majority for not giving them time to debate this tax program while they are debating and criticizing and critiquing the tax program there seems to be a great inconsistency in that logic as they present their case the fact is they are using the house time to debate the package and it is not limited to 1 day but i am sure we are going to hear many speeches not just in special orders but in the time we call 1 minutes at the start of our legislative business as well next i would also like to address the issue of fairness in the ways and means committee process the committees did take many hours of public testimony from a whole host and variety of groups a lot of the debate of course has been focused on the energy tax the btu tax at first people jokingly said oh we finally figured out we are going to tax the british to resolve the deficit and of course as we got down to seriously studying the impact of the energy tax on this country different proposals and refinements were suggested to make the presidents proposal much better so the committee did deliberate in public received tremendous testimony from every region of the country from a variety of interest groups paid lobbyists and not consumer groups as well who came in and gave their opinions on the deficit reduction package on the earned income tax credit for the working poor in our nation to the energy tax to the effect of the corporate taxes as well so the process was open then it was time for the committee to get down to work in what we call a markup a work session on the bill where we considered the various amendments we considered privately dozens of amendments and in public many amendments were offered before the committee most were rejected it came to the point where the chairman tells us that it was necessary to expedite the process so that we would not be stuck here all summer long trying to craft a tax bill and the two caucuses went into private session yes we did emerge with a democratic proposal there was a lot of debate inside the room if you will with no lobbyists no tv cameras there great progress was made and we did reach a consensus on the democratic side and i believe as well on the republican side in terms of their position as well refinements were made changes were made arguments were made with the white house some of us won some of our arguments and lost others i can tell you that the president was heavily involved directly as was his executive level staff in trying to bring this issue to a close so yes sometimes you do close the doors and you do shut out the tv cameras and the newspaper reporters and all the lobbyists on this capitol hill and you roll up your sleeves and craft a compromise that truly reflects the needs and concerns of a variety of regions of the country so many times it seemed to me that it was not a specific member talking it was a member from the northeast talking to a member from the northwest and arguing with the oil production states about the effect of one kind of energy tax over another it did occur we went back into public session of course amendments were offered again in public were voted on in public the bill was sent to the budget committee which is our process and to the rules committee and to the house floor in a public vote there is a bit of smoke out there in terms of how open the process was i think clearly public testimony was listened to adhered to in many instances good ideas were suggested to make this fair and to make this a good piece of legislation that does not mean it is going to be an easy piece of legislation that lead me to the president and what he has talked about for the past year as a candidate as an individual citizen as a governor and now as our president he said that we should have tax fairness in this country that those who made a lot of money in the 1980s ought to be called upon to help reduce the deficit and to meet some of the social needs that remain in this nation during the 1990s to take us into a very competitive situation in the year 2000 when you increase the deficit by 3 trillion as we have done over the past 12 years and both congress and the administration can find fault and take blame for that you do not erase that 3 trillion deficit in just 120 days of a new administration it is going to take time it is going to take patience but most of all as the president has said it takes fairness it takes fairness and sacrifice the premier part of this piece of legislation which many colleagues on the other side of the aisle fail to address is that we are asking the millionaires in this country to pay a surtax on their incomes we are asking the millionaires to help pay for this reduction in deficits we are also asking some corporations some corporations not all corporations in this country but some to pay a little bit more of their corporate earnings of their profits to help rebuild america by reducing the deficit and providing some other tax incentives which i will go into we are asking those corporations who earn more than 10 million a year toinstead of paying a top rate bf 34 percent to pay a top rate of 35 percent how many corporations are in that category twentyseven hundred we are asking the 2 700 most wealthy corporations in america to pay a little bit more 1 percent just 1 percent for america that is all we are asking the president proposed a 2percent increase to increase it from 34 to 36 because of the public testimony we received we argued successfully with the president to drop the income tax credit that he proposed as part of his package we did not take the savings that would be left over from that credit and spend it on a social program no we said you therefore do not need to raise the corporate tax rate that extra 1 percent and that is what the democratic proposal argued successfully and that is what we are arguing in this package come we hope thursday or later this week so we have to focus on the good of this bill that it is fair and that what the american people and the people back home in my district in oregon have passed and demanded of us is deficit reduction there is no magic to deficit reduction they have asked for spending cuts we have passed the budget bill earlier this spring in march or early april and there are real spending cuts there they are there there are 3 in spending cuts for every new dollar in new investments in other words for every dollar of new investment that goes to things like new police officers in our communities which is part of this budget reconciliation bill to national service to child immunization programs which saves us health care dollars in the long run and is only fair and humane to the little child in america to defense onversion to take all those defense workers whether in southern california or the state of missouri and other places in this country and help them from the transition of a very good defenserelated job which is as we know deadend economics into a much more productive job that they are trained to do whether it isbuilding mass transitbuses whether it is rebuilding the infrastructure in america these are good americans with a great american work ethic and the only thing they know how to do is not not build a bomb is to not build an mx missile that showing a limitation of their educational ability they are able to put those work ethics and that knowledge into skill into something that is productive for the world and our society that has potential for this country and for our society there are over 200 cuts in spending programs 250 billion in deficit reduction through spending cuts the cuts are there there is no magic to this it also takes tax increases it is hard to say it is hard to say and we on the committee targetted those tax increases to where it could be fairly applied we ask the top 2 700 corporations in this country who make over 10 billion a year in profits to pay a little bit more for america we ask the millionaires in this country the millionaires who do not have to worry about paying their rent buying their food to pay a little bit more to reduce the deficit in america and why is that so important president clinton talked about that for this past year he has talked about it for the last 120 days it does not get enough attention all one has to do is watch the stock market reports and look at the interest rates interest rates continue to remain low the reports are they will continue to be low and may even drop further if if congress does its job the president has done his it is our responsibility to keep those to keep those interest rates low and why why are they being lowered because the market is responding to the leadership of bill clinton who says yes im going to cut the deficit in half now if we do not follow through i am afraid those interest rates are going to skyrocket and what does that mean in terms of dollars and cents to the american taxpayers pocket let us take housing a number of individuals in my state and throughout the country have refinanced their homes or they have gotten the long term the long term mortgage that they were afraid they would never be able to pay because that balloon paymerit was right around the corner and instead of paying 10 or 12 percent home mortgage interest they are now paying 7 or 71 4 percent interest and the bank said put on new employees to keep up with the demand of this refinancing program that means more money for every homeowner in america and look at a state like mine that is so dependent on the wood products and forest products industry and at that firsttime home buyer they can now buy that great american dream their own home because they have not in their lifetimes i am certain they have never seen interest rates this low and this is the time for them to buy but those days will be limited if congress does not respond to the presidents challenge and keep the interest rates low by halving the deficit that is our mission this week how else does this help the american taxpayer directly i say to my colleagues you go to your local public school or your local government and theyre going to go out into the bond market to build that new school building because the one is outdated or it got hit by an earthquake as truly happened in my district or the numbers of students have grown and they need a new elementary school and theyre going to finance by going to the bond market to finance that these interest rates have a direct influence on that bond market as well because if those bond interest rates are lower that means that the local property tax payer as it is in my home state is going to pay less for those bonds to build that new school and it is the same with local government financing whether it is some sort of very expensive infrastructure a sewage treatment plant that is needed to bring in that new industry it is cheaper it is cheaper for those taxpayers if we keep those interest rates low my colleagues on the other wide of the aisle failed to explain the positives about this piece of legislation they have centered only on it seems the btu tax they are not talking about this but imagine if your local government is finally able to go build that water treatment facility or build that school that is what we are talking about specifically for americans to truly understand the unity tax is a difficult piece of legislation i am from the northwest water runs downhill and that is how we make electricity in the northwest it is cheap it is energy efficient to the tune of 85 percent it is cost effective yes it hurts the fish runs in my region my region has spent a billion dollars over the last 10 years to fix those fish runs and we will do it and we will spend millions 4nd hundreds of millions of dollars more but we have the luxury of lower compared to other regions of the country lower cost energy no doubt about it we get a benefit from that we get energy intensive industry coming out to the northwest we have forests that are there and it is no accident therefore that we have the papermanufacturing businesses in the northwest because we have the resources that is the trees and we also have the lower cost energy which makes us competitive on a world market so when they come to me and saythe president comes to say we all should pay a little bit more energy tax i wince i go back home to my district and i talk to people the aluminum industry said yes well pay more of an energy tax to run our plants but in terms of the chemical process we want a break i say justify that they give me the science the presidents tax billit is called the feedstock i learned more about feedstock than i ever thought i would when i was in a sixth grade class but the president allowed oil as a feedstock exemption they allowed coal as a feedstock exemption i argued that electricity as a feedstock ought to be exempted as well he gave me 50 percent he met me halfway that was good enough for me for now we will see what our friends on the senate might do to refine this but it is a good bill and my aluminum industries in the northwest are supported because they understand the moral of reducing the deficit that they will save their money too when they go to the financing institutions and ask for a business expansion loan they know they are going to get a better interest rate for that reference was made to the border adjustment bureau that will have to be set up yes and that was compromised that came from the committeenot from the president but from the committee said look if were going to impose this energy tax yes aluminum for example is a worldwide competitive market we have some energy intensive industries as the paper industry as other manufacturing concerns who use a lot of energy but its not part of a chemical process what are we going to do to make sure that the playing field is as level as possible because we are in an international economy and what the congressman from maryland came up with was a border adjustment tax so that when there are energy intensive imports into this country that they pay a like tax as that similar industry in america so that we are levelling the playing field and we are taxing energy in this country and on those competitive products that are international in scope is that good policy you bet it is going to force industries into reexamining the energy wastes in their products you bet is that good for energy policy in this country and throughout the world you bet you bet it is and we can take this home and proudly say we are finally taxing energy in this country at a rate that will encourage energy conservation and make these industries much more efficient in the production and use of energy because the fact is businesses will do this because they know it is a direct way they can cut costs at the same time at the same time they know that if they are energy efficient they will be helping to reduce further our federal deficit it is phased in does not go into effect until the summer of 1994 so businesses can adjust the american consumer can adjust perhaps they can insulate their home a little bit more save money over the long term anyway they ought to do it is this good energy policy for the american consumer you bet it is the btu tax the energy tax is going to be phased in as i say beginning in the summer of 1994 and phased in in three equal stages over a 3year period a family making 40 000 household income a year will pay 1 a month more twelve bucks a year folks that is what we are asking for your contribution to reduce the deficit and to think energy conservation at home in 1995 it will be 7 and then only 17 a month when it is fully phased in according to both the treasury department and the congressional budget office so 4 years from now you will be paying 17 more a month if you have a household income of 40 000 we have established a deficitreduction trust fund we have a credibility problem in the congress and the administration about deficit reduction there is no problem about it so the gentleman from new york has come up with this idea agreed to by the president that we will take the deficit money and put it in this trust fund to show that we truly are halving the deficit by about 246 billion let me talk about this deficit reduction our colleagues on the other side in the minority party point out the number what happens when this plan comes into effect and how much the debt will be the true question is if we do nothing how great will the deficit be it will grow by another 246 billion if we do nothing the president is asking to cut the proposed deficit in half that is what we are talking about spending cuts that is why we are talking about revenue increases fairly applied to millionaires in this country and the richest corporations let me also talk about one other provision in this bill called the earned income tax credit the eitc this is probably one of the best social policy programs that this congress has adopted in the past 6 or 8 years it has great partisan support because it gives a tax credit to those that work the president has long talked about the concept of making work pay in this country what he has done is has asked this country to ensure that anybody in this nation who is working full time that they should not be living in poverty that is what the earned income tax credit is all about he has proposed an expansion which we on the committee on ways and means fully endorsed so that we finally get to that level of coverage for the tax credit so that anybody who is working full time in america whether they have children or not will not be living below the poverty level it is very simple it costs a little bit of money yes and i explained where we are getting the revenue to pay that we are going to ask the millionaires to help fund this earned income tax credit and they will so if you are making up to 26 000 a year and depending upon the number of children you have the numbers will work out that you apply for this credit you will receive it and the credit will be such that you will not be living below the poverty line in america we are making work pay through the presidents leadership he is saying we should take away the incentive to stay on welfare you should not be able to have more household income if you are on welfare than if you are working even if it is a minimum wage job there are so many benefits to work to having a job in this country such as the role model that you provide for your children and your own selfesteem the president is saying you should not be penalized for taking that minimum wage job and that is why we are offering this great expansion of this earned tax credit i think that this is very significant to the american people it is the first major step in welfare reform that the president is going to be presenting to the congress later this year it is almost as important as the deficitreduction issue yet people on the other side of the aisle are not talking about this earned income tax credit and suggesting that maybe it is a very difficult vote they are making it sound like it is very easy we are proposing an energy tax and therefore it is a bad bill and we should vote no if this was all there was to this bill i would vote no myself but we are spending the money on deficit reduction from the energy tax we are spending the money on making work pay in this country that is what we are doing in this piece of legislation as i mentioned before we talked about the investment tax credit it got so complicated that the only full employment program would be for the accountants and the tax lawyers in this country and we shelved it we said what can we do that is very simple for the small business people in this country that would help stimulate the economy right now what we did was say ok right now they get in their business expenses they get automatic business expense under current law 10 000 the president said if you are going to take away the itc i want you to raise the expensing level to 25 000 we said mr president why dont you just double it 20 000 that ought to be enough he said no 2 000 or nothing keep current law he was tough and he is right and i ran into lois kenagy a farmer a wonderful woman out in my district very much involved in the peace movement she came in to talk to me about the nuclear disarmament issue she said explain to me this expensing thing again i explained it to her she said ok great i can finally buy that diesel tractor that i have been needing for my farm she is going to go out if we do our job and buy that diesel tractor that is jobs for america right away it is simple lois kenagy who does not have an accounting degree or tax degree but is a smart business person knows what it means to her and is going to take advantage of it i would say to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle we are talking about this great issue for our small businesses in this country which we know create most of the jobs in this country so we are talking about tax fairness it is tough we are talking about real spending cuts they will be tough as well because we will hear from our local governments who all of a sudden will say why are you cutting back we will say because we do not have a balanced budget and you do or a constituent will come and say why arent you helping us in that spending program any longer i am saying because we have got to get our economic house in order we have got to cut the deficit and we have got to get to the day when we have a balanced budget we are making work pay we have the earned income tax credit that will be fully expanded so work will pay in this country that somebody going to work will not be living under the poverty level in the richest most powerful nation on earth and yes we will have an energy policy and energy tax in this country that will encourage evdry individual in this country to conserve energy to wrap that material around their hot water tank and make sure their hot water pipes are wrapped and that they put good insulation in those buildings that is what we are talking about we are talking about efficiency in business so this is a good economic program for america it is tough but it is fair i hope on

made in order by the rule i am strongly opposed to the bryant amendment which requires unitedstates allies to pay 100 percent of our overseas costs or else all unitedstates troops must be withdrawn this amendment fails to recognize that the united states maintains forward deployed forces in order to promote democracy enhance stability and deter would be aggressors in regions where the united states has critical economic political and security interests therefore i strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on the bryant amendment i am also strongly opposed to the frank amendment which would reduce dod fiscal year 1994 funds for military activities in europe by 1 billion deep cuts in the budget for overseas defense activities as required by the frank amendment would result in a considerable loss in the readiness of unitedstates forces stationed in europe and or deeper reductions in the number of unitedstates forces stationed there as such the practical effect of this amendment could be to force a return to the hollow forces of the 1970s in a region where the united states maintains critical economic political and security interests i should remind my colleagues that united states forces based in europe are responsible for promoting and defending americas interests across some 82 nations in an area of responsibility that encompasses not just europe but also parts of the near east north africa and subsaharan africa in the past year alone these forces have been called upon to perform a wide variety of challenging missions for example emergency evacuations of unitedstates citizens humanitarian relief monitoring and enforcing u n resolutions and providing surveillance of suspected drug traffickers my colleagues should also be aware that defense overseas funding has already been cut by approximately 30 percent since fiscal year 1992 it may surprise some of my colleagues to know that contrary to the grossly inaccurate conventional wisdom less than 10 percent of the annual unitedstates defense budget is actually allocated for overseas defense actmties of unitedstates troops in addition the basing infrastructure in europe has already been significanfly reduced to date the united states has announced the closure or realignment of over 50 percent of the installations we occupled at the stad of the drawdown in january it is vital that the united states sustain a credible force presence in europe as gen john shalikashvill our next jcs chairman has observed our military contribution to nato is significant compared to those of other member nations so is our influence nothing can be more favorable for unitedstates interests in europe than to retain that degree of influence yet the approach recommended by mr frank if adopted could result in a dramatic decline in americas ability to influence events in europe and throughout parts of africa and asia furthermore it could result in a regional military force that is increasingly hollow and unable to perform the missions it will inevitably be called upon to conduct for these reasons i strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on the frank amendment likewise i oppose the schroeder amendment which would require the 1995 defense base realignment and closure commission to include foreign bases along with domestic bases in its closure recommendations and require that at least 25 percent of the bases recommended for closure be overseas facilites if enacted the schroeder amendment would slow the process of closing or realigning overseas military bases considerably the united states is reducing overseas bases far more rapidly than here at home the number of defense sites or installations overseas where operations have ended or been reduced now stands at 840 in light of president clintons stated intention to drawdown to 100 000 troops in europe by september 1996 additional overseas base closure announcements will be forthcming the dod plan s to reduce the overseas base structure by appo dmately 40 percent from cold war levels consistent with planned reductions in personnel stationed overseas in addition the schroeder amendment would greatly complicate unitedstates foreign pocy by involving civilian base closure commissioners in complex treaty and statusofforces agreement negotiations with foreign nations regarding te residual value of base properties etc such an approach is both undesirable unrealistic and untenable therefore i urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by my colleague mrs schroeder on the other hand i support the uoydsisisky amendment which takes into account the progress in burdensharing negotiations with our allies that has occurred over the past several years many of these developments were noted in a may 1993 department of defense report to congress entitled allied contributions to the common defense let me briefly remind my colleagues of some of these positive developments first japan currently funds virtually all dod incountry construction costs and provides at no charge land and facilities used by united states forces these contributions represent roughly 3 billion a year in direct outlays foregone receipts and opportunity costs in addtion under the costsharing arrangement concluded in 1991 japan is assuming all labor and utilities costs such that by 1995 japan will bear virtually all costs of united states forces stationed on its soil second the republic of korea provides land and facilities for united states use logistics support including ammunition storage and equipment maintenance and manpower augmentees to united states army units these contributions represent roughly 2 billion a year in addition korea has agreed to assume by 1995 a costsharing contribution equal to roughly onethird of wonbased stationing costs e g labor construction and operations and maintenance korea is also assuming the lead role in our defense alliance for example on december 1 1992 a korean general assumed command over combined united states and south korean ground forces third our allies provide significant levels of economic assistance to developing nations worldwide in addition to contributing aid to the nations of eastern europe and to the newly independent states of the former soviet union this percentage is likely to increase as the congress requires further reductions in unitedstates foreign assistance programs fourth a year ago nato agreed in response to a unitedstates requestto an important change in the infrastructure program extending eligibility for common funding to operations and maintenance costs specifically those o m costs bome by the united states to operate reinforcement facilities the united states annually pays about 275 million in such costs this is not to suggest that we should end our efforts to achieve more equitable burdensharing arrangements with our allies indeed the unitedstates government is presently exploring with our allies a variety of ways to reduce our stationing costs such as seeking additional inkind support educing local national employment costs waiving or reducing fees and taxes and increasing cooperative programs it does suggest however that in designing burdensharing strategies for nato and our pacific allies we should eschew a oneformulafitsall approach to the issue instead it is critical to tailor our objectives to strategic and political characteristics of each alliance as well as to the military political and economic circumstances of each ally of the four burdensharing amendments before us today only the lloydsisisky amendment takes such developments into account finally my colleagues should be aware that the administration strongly opposes the bryant schroeder and frank amendments in a september 7 1993 letter from secretary of state warren christopher and secretary of defense les aspin they state these amendments would jeopardize our countrys ability to sustain its strategic interests abroad if enacted into law these amendments would force the withdrawal of unitedstates troops from europe and with them would go our leadership position in european affairs and our ability to promote and protect our vital national interests there these proposed amendments run contrary to unitedstates interests and would portend disastrous consequences certainly a diminution of american prestige and leadership unitedstates european presence and regional and world influence what the united states has achieved in europe over the past half century would be in jeopardy for these reasons

distinguished gentleman from new mexico the ranking member of the subcommittee and to all the members of the subcommittee for their exceptional work in bringing this bill to the floor this measure includes 750 million in loan authority for the farmers home section 502 middle income loan guarantee program this member originally proposed this housing program and ultimately steered it through the house banking committee after a very successful 20state demonstration program in 1991 the 502 unsubsidized loan guarantee program was expanded to all 50 states in 1992 once the program was in place this member successfully pushed in the authorizing committee for the income limits of the program to be expanded from a top limit of 100 percent of median area income to a top income of 115 percent of median area income to match existing hud programs for urban areas the 329 5 million in loan authority appropriated in fiscal 1993 was completely allocated in the first 6 months of thisfiscal year congress recently passed a supplemental bill to provide another 250 million in loan authority for the program this member is as you might expect very supportive of additional appropriations for this program the clinton administration is equally supportive requesting 681 768 million in loan authority for fiscal 1994 the committee members are to be commended for recognizing the value of this unsubsidized program and providing funding levels which are more in line with the demand for the program from lenders borrowers and future lowmiddle and middleincome homeowners i want to reiterate my compliments to the distinguished gentleman from illinois chairman of the subcommittee and the distinguished ranking member the gentleman from new mexico and all of the members of the subcommittee for the outstanding effort they have made in analyzing the variety of programs in this appropriation measure i have already commented favorably on the subcommittees recognition of the need for additional

development administration and returning those responsibilities to the farmers home administrationhopefully for the most part to the state directors of fmha second this member appreciates the restoration of 10 million to the cooperators program third this member thinks it is the appropriate step to appropriate at current levels for the market promotion program however i would say i have great reservations and concerns about the way the subcommittee is proposing legislative language in the area of federal crop insurance programs but i realize that the federal crop insurance program is a program crying out for reform and richly deserving such reform let me conclude by saying that my state generally ranked fourth in agricultural production with a preeminent land grant institution the university of nebraskalincoln had important research projects requests advanced by this member before the subcommittee that were not included in this legislation i regret that fact i suspect that the subcommittee is looking ahead to the good efforts of the junior senator from nebraska a member on the appropriations committee in the other body to advance the unl proposals but i would say that the chinch bug research conducted by kansas state university and the university of nebraskalincoln which this member requested for continuation is a unique problem in parts of kansas and nebraska a solution is extraordinarily important to our states i hope it continues to be funded by the other body and sustained in the conference the variety of programs related to a food processing center a research program emphasizing nonfarm industrial user for agricultural products and continued research in the area of sustainable agriculture at unl are very important to the agricultural industry in my state and to farmer and agricultural processing around our nation yet these applied research projects were not recommended by the sub committee i regret that fact and ask the house conferees to support initiatives from the other body on these specific proposals or programs finally i would make a point which i believe would be appreciated by all members of the agriculture and the appropriations subcommittee if you take a look at the total appropriation considered here it is approximately 70 6 billion our urban colleagues and rural colleagues should remember that incredibly nearly foursevenths of this total budget goes for the domestic and food programs at 39 4 billion on the other hand if you take a look at those appropriations directly related to agriculture instead of 39 4 billion we are talking about a total of 22 4 billion so the agricultural processing production and marketing programs today at 22 4 billion of the total 570 6 billion is a minority part of the dollars spent by usda this is a point of concern which is frequently advanced at the town hall meetings i hold farmers and agricultural processors want the critiques of usda expenditures and all americans to know that only a small part goes for what are directly considered to be the farm programs while about four sevenths of 39 4 billion of the total 70 6 appropriated in this bill goes to the

heard from the head of the steel workers union and representatives of the american iron and steel institute the specialty steel industry the steel service center institute the steel manufacturers association and the committee on pipe and tube imports the good news is that during the period of the voluntary restraint agreements the unitedstates steel industry invested more than 35 billion in modernizing their plants and becoming the most productive steel producers in the world the bad news is that the dumping of foreign steel into this country in the late 1970s and early 1980s before the vras were put on so devastated the industrythat over the last decadeemployment in steel production dropped from 500 000 to 180 000 the notion that the steel industry needed protection from the dumping of subsidized foreign steel by the use of vras bitterly was fought by the proponents of free tradethe followers of adam smith but the proof of the pudding is in the eating and the month that the vras ran out rampunt dumping of foreign subsidized steel began again the preliminary determinations by the department of commerce last monththat 21 foreign nations have systematically dumped steel into our markets should give all of us hope that the next step before the international trade commission to assess the amount of damage to our companies will be equally positive and supportive of the industry it is about time that the law of the congress the intent of the most representative branch of government is recognized by the eecutive branch and we hope will be respected by the judicial branch when damages are assessed by the itc as you are all aware in the past trade laws have not been allowed to proceed to conclusion for the steel industry settlements have been negotiated with foreign governments in aotions which have been invariably detrimental to the domestic industry already the european community once again seems to be moving in that direction with the announcement that the multilateral steel agreement meetings reconvened in geneva february 2426 these are the negotiations on which the europeans walked out refusing to give up subsidies to their companies now they respond to the commerce decision as though it was done purely to get them back to negotiating wrong i am led to believe by all of my sources that this time the american steel industry will hold the coursewin lose or draw on the itc decision i applaud their position it is a good sign a heartening sign i am impressed that the new trade representative mr kantor has announced that the united states will retaliate against government procurement rules adopted by the ec that favor ec telecommunications and electrical equipment manufacturers the washington post reported february 2 the first of the

states break the old marshall plan mindset that europe and japan damaged by world war ii needed and in some way deserved special treatment by the rich victorious united states we not only encouraged this dependence to keep them from slipping into the hands of the communist but over the last 40 years as those countries socialist all accepted this privileged position they began to reach for more to the point that now any resistance on our part brings charges that we are starting trade wars while the marshall plan proved to be a brilliant political tool against the spread of communism and was certainly an incredibly humane concept on the part of a victorious nation over the vanquishedthe need for such treatment is long past to the contrary among the industrial nations that we helped rebuild we are the only ones suffering la trade deficit of monumental proportions the only net debtor nation of the lot and we have the largest domestic debt this burden has been borne disproportionately by the manufacturing base of this country over the years that steel has invested tens of billions of dollars in modernization the greatest competitor for borrowing money has been the treasury of the united states ever pushing up the interest rates and when those rates broke on the back of a recession in a national election year the steel industry and its customers had credit lines closed sources of borrowing dried up in the face of the banks moving in to buy treasury notes rather than lending money on the streets so the business expansion needed was nipped in the bud by

can hope thatat leastour domestic steel producers will not have to continue to compete unfairly with nations which underwrite their industries losses their industries compliance with environmental laws steel has a good story to tell in the past few years the steel industry has accomplished miracles since 1981 despite scarce high capital in the country the industry has raised and increased investment in steel by billions of dollars production in raw steel continuously cast has gone from 21 6 million in 1981 to 66 6 million in 1990 with a smaller work force i am proud that in manhours per ton of steel we are lower than japan germany the united kingdom and france employment costs which includes percentage of operating cost and hourly compensation are lower than the united kingdom canada korea mexico brazil and taiwan according to world steel intelligence from 1979 to 1985 hourly output in factories increased 2 8 percent annually from 1985 to 1990 output in factories rose 3 5 percent compensation for americans as a whole changed radically in 5 years in 1985 it averaged 13 01 for production workers but by 1990 france canada norway and germany were surpassing american pay levels obviously what we have been talking about in modernization equates to fewer jobs so what we need is greater sales to translate these investments into profits and more jobs for that reason i believe it is important to watch the procurement actions of government i know that under gatt pressure the unitedstates governors have decided to abolish buy america but the recent actions by the ec to protect their own telecommunications industry may make the states rethink this position hi043 in 1990 there were 12 169 procurement actions which resulted in an award of 5 1 billion to foreign firms without reviewing each job it is difficult to tell about the price but i can tell you one thing most of the foreign firms probably were subsidized and of equal importance supported by their government in the bidding procedure something that does not happen with american business with the numbers of new unemployed 50 000 at sears 20 000 at boeing 2 000 at kodak 6 000 at united technologies plus the earlier layoffs at gm and ibmthe trade agreements now being negotiatednafta and gattmust be crafted very carefully to make sure that there is a reciprocity built infor our industriesto balance the positive effect of the value added tax on both european exports and imports the vat added to every import serves as an average 19 percent taxiffthe vat rebated to the manufacturerexporter serves as an average 19 percent export bonus in mentioning the accomplishments of the steel industry i want to point out that american manufacturers in general are doing a much more competent job than the media credits as these figures testify for whatever reasons over this last decade the popular image of unitedstates industry presented on tv and in the movies has been of polluters malevolent employers who deliberately expose employees to toxic substancesheartless big businessimages reinforced by the explosion of investigative tv news shows that make their ratings exposing the rogue the scoundrel long gone is the image of the employerbenefactor made popular by the celluloid jimmy stewarts the spencer traceys the robert youngs front page reports on the real characters of the 1980s the milkins the keatings the altmans of bcci fameemployers who seemingly chose to benefit themselves rather than benefit their shareholders their workers have changed the perception of the average american about american business we know certainly i dodealing with the greater baltimore business community that milkin and keating are stereotypical bad guys and jimmy stewart stereotypical of the alltime favorite good guy and in my long experience in my business community ive never really dealt with either one of those extreme types however if the movies are going to give us films such as wall street with its milkintype hero saying greed is good then it is only fair that they season the public perception with a major movie on the struggle of a small companythe only industry left in a small townto overcome the increased costs estimated since 1989 to have grown by a whopping 34 percentto implement the growing numbers of government laws and regulations laid on american businesses i would hope they would put a human face on the countless numbers of men and women who have invested the work and savings of a lifetime in creating a business and jobssome of them discovering 10 to 15 years into the effortthat their industry has slipped into the nevernever land of the superfund and that suddenly a plant which was valued at 4 or 5 million is no longer an asset but a liability that the formerly friendly bank now wants their homes as equity that the business which they once thought to leave their children has now become a twilight industry a vertible albatross i can tell you theres a lot of heroism left in this country a lot of fortitude and just plain old american sticktoitism out in the business community or we would have much greater unemployment than we have now and we need to get that story out we need to have the great numbers of americans seeking jobs or hoping for better jobs young people counting on building careers in good stable companies unemployed defense workers and the increasing numbers being let out of the services all of these people need to know the problems of american industry steel has a good story to tell i have spent my career in the congress fighting for machine tools and fasteners fighting for steel and foundries fighting for buy america i have pushed for a marshall plan for america back in 1987 i introduced a resolution calling for a government commission to study a marshall plan for our own country no takers then but i find it interesting that the democrat leaders in announcing their budget plans for 1992 called for a marshall plan for america i understand that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery as the congress moves more and more in its demand that companies stand in loco parentis to employees overlaying all of the requirements of socialist nations upon a capitalist system without picking up the tab as the real socialists do it is incumbent upon those of us who know the burdens and real costs of creating jobs to tell the people what the government regulations are doing to their hopes of finding jobs in like manner the new tax proposals should be studied for the impact on jobs creation over the next 4 years in proposing an energy tax heavy manufacturing will be hit the hardestservice sector jobs impacted the least steel auto manufacturing glass foundriesevery one struggling right now just to stay afloat will be hit with higher costs some of which must be passed on in product cost making them less competitive with foreign productspushing inflation if the tax package is being sold to the country as favoring taking money away from the rich and redistributing it to the poor in the proposed business taxes it is just the opposite proposed tax credits for investment will pay off only to the companies who are making a profit wealthy corporations will pay more taxes but they also are able to take advantage of the tax credit provisions but to a whole host of companiesthe airlines basic industries construction added energy taxes could push them over the edge and there are darned few profits for them to either reinvest or take a tax credit against for whatever reason the proposals in thi new tax package pits the interest of the have corporations against the have nots and goliath wins this onesuccessful small businesses pitted against the struggling startupsanother strong win for goliath and agriculture is pitted against everyone elsenot only because of program cuts but because energy costs impact so much on the cost of not only what they do but what they purchase if dividing and conquering works this tax program should go through but it is so devisive of industry so weighted against the most fragile of our industries and small businesses ineluding our farmers that every day which passes with one more revelation of the true cost to the economy of one more of these taxes makes the chance of its passage lessen government does not create wealth government has never created a valueadded job effective government can only support an atmosphere which allows valueadded jobs and wealth to be created dividing and conquering may be good politics but i question that it is good governance"]]}
