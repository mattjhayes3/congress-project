the species of sea turtles that live in the waters off our shores and nest on gulf coast and south atlantic beaches each year an estimated 11 000 turtles drown in the nets of american shrimp boats development of the turtle excluder device or ted has made these incidental mortalities avoidable acknowledging the benefits of teds the reagan administration and my home state of south carolina have acted to require most shrimp fishermen to utilize these inexpensive devices by enacting the legislation we are now considering congress does two things it ratifies the secretary of commerces action in promulgating ted regulations it also clarifies the secretarys right to modify the regulations if he determines that it is necessary to require shrimpers to use teds in months when they are not now required to use them the only things that he cannot do is to delay the implementation of regulations beyond the dates set forth in the legislation this legislation also requires a study of many other facets of the conservation needs of our nations sea turtles i support this study and hope that the secretary can use its results in determining how best to further reduce the incidental drowning of

the last 3 days because we came back on monday the smile stretches to both earlobes because notre dame stomped stanford 52 to something i do not know 52 to 14 i forget dan drives with bobbie sometimes flies with bobbie sometimes to the notre dame games of course it is closer from here to indiana than it is when he is back home i am sure he will be there at the usc game when probably the no 2 team in the nation meets the no 4 team in the nation i predict notre dame will move up a notch he not only went to notre dame after he graduated there lie came to law school here in washington dc to one of the top schools in the country to georgetown university he interned for george murphy over in the unitedstates senate i am doing all of this from memory and i hope i do not get it mixed up here dan he worked for george murphy then in his last few years at law school worked over at the republican national committee during some rough days then under george bush when bush was the national chairman for

how the washington post goes around with its bob woodwardtype people and gets figures on successful programs but i have seen print in papers that over 650 million a year went to afghanistan that over a thousand tennessee mules have gone there that hightech stinger missiles have gone there and not one single liberal in this chamber including some who hate what we have done in afghanistan has ever

have ongoing operations in those countries and there were four stars there from 1950 that had no name after them now i believe the number is way over 45 46 names in other words in the last decade

difficult adversary in geneva where we have a firstrate professional team trying to hammer out some arms control agreements that has europe on the edge of its chair and has all of us hoping and praying something that will advance the cause of peace can be accomplished what are we doing here today well we have the defense intellectuals going to micromicromini manage arms control we are going to legislate limitations on our negotiators it is as though we stand behind them at this life or death poker game and we do not just wigwag the soviets what cards we are holding we reach in and pull the cards out of our negotiators hands we want them to play with a deck with 25 cards we have to go through three sets of negotiations the media and congress and then the soviet union why do we do this to ourselves why it is just incredible first of all let us talk about the nuclear sublimits let us talk about salt ii an unratified treaty and why was it not ratified it would not have had the votes to pass and president carter pulled it back because the soviets invaded afghanistan today we are going to ratify a part of that treaty by what is in this bill we are going to insist that our government observe numerical sublimits that are in a part of the salt treaty it is interesting why you just select that this is a treaty and it is not a treaty it is a proposed treaty that has been massively violated by the soviet union they have produced a new weapons system the ss25 that is a violation of the treaty they have encrypted the telemetry so we cannot tell what we have and what they are doing a violation of the treaty they have violated all the other treaties and so what is our response shackle the hands of our negotiators how silly and i say that with keen regret how do you ever get the soviets to comply with the treaty if you do not reserve some flexibility to our country to respond why prevent us from responding well it is nonsense and then i move to the other foolish improvident unwise silly limitation of forbidding us to test any nuclear weapons above 1 kiloton that is not arms control because it does not reduce anything it weakens our deterrence it is asymmetrical and a weakened deterrence is a threat to world peace we have had more reductions in weapons and in explosive power under testing than under any treaties as a matter of fact we have reduced the number of nuclear weapons by onethird since 1967 not due to salt i or abm or salt ii or helsinki or yalta or any of those great treaties that we make with the soviet union but due to testing we have tested and modernized made them smaller more accurate and we have reduced the number we have reduced by threequarters in the last 20 years the explosive power because of testing now i would think in an age of challenger where we lost the lives of some astronauts because there were not adequate tests that you would demand tests we are always criticizing the defense department they did not test this tank they did not test this plane they did not test this satellite but by god nuclear weapons we are not going to test we are going to watch them get old and degrade and deteriorate and say that is arms control it is nonsense as long as you rely on nuclear weapons as your deterrent ask europe folks you better have them safe you better have them reliable and you better have them effective once more this congress the majority party puts handcuffs and leg irons around the defense of this country and our negotiators at geneva why to bash reagan i think it is such nonsense how do you keep our scientists working testing when there is nothing to test we are forbidden to test we will lose them they will go into the skateboard industry or teaching somewhere but you will not keep

handicapped person or to someone who plans to allow handicapped people to reside there that sounds quite fair of course no one should discriminate against persons who are handicapped the problem is the bill in section 802 defines handicapped as a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such persons major life activities or a record of having such an impairment or being regarded as having such an impairment i unfortunately we no longer have a commonsense meaning for the word handicapped thanks to a recent supreme court decision in march the court ruled the school board of nassau county versus arline that the definiton of handiehpped included persons with contagious diseases in adoltion in two 1978 court cases the meaning of handi capped was also extended to include alcoholics and those addicted to illegal drugs this means these people are now protected by law against discrimination unless congress changes the law to protect our citizenry of course fortunately the bill was amended in full committee to exclude current drug addicts from being con idered handicapped but current alcoholics will still get tile same protection as handicapped persons unless the bill is amended today on the floor in addition persons with contagious diseases also get handicapped protection unless they pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals the problem is the burden of proving that threat falls on the landlord of tile project there is also the possibility that the supreme courts arline decision which said that persons with contagious diseases are considered handicapped would extend the extraordinary protectior s of tie fair housing bill to aids patients under the fair housing bill for example a landlord would have the

handicapped person is not a threat to the public health however in many cases a victim of aids may be under the fair housing bill a landlord would have the burden of proving that the aids patient is a

than separated diplomatic processes and military pressure and third conducted itself in such a way as to engender multilateral support from the nations in the region and institutionalized
