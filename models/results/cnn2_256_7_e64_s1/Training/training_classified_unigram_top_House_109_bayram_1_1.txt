have committed to do those of us who are in the health care field and interested as our previous speaker the gentleman from louisiana who worked in the administration prior to being elected to congress from the great state of louisiana and specifically worked within the medicare system there are a lot of people on our side of the aisle who understand the issue of health care it is disturbing to me as a physician member when i hear the other side in the social security debate as we hear some of these special orders in the evening from the other side criticizing the president criticizing the republican leadership the republican majority for wanting to make some meaningful changes to a 70yearold system that needs to be brought into the 21st century of course i am talking about social security but we are hearing from the other side and i hear this in my district a lot of times it seems like they encourage people to come to these listening sessions or town hall meetings and say why are you republicans so concerned about social security when you are not doing anything about medicare what they fail to tell these good folks in our districts usually seniors that in december of 2003 we historically passed the medicare modernization and yes prescription drug act part d of medicare and really made some significant meaningful changes to this program admittedly medicare and medicaid as well are very expensive programs and as our seniors are living longer and of course putting more of a strain on the social security system the same thing is happening in medicare but to suggest that we in the majority or this president has ignored meaningful changes modernization indeed in just this past december of 2003 trying to address that problem and for us to say that we have done nothing and to try to divert our attention away now from trying to do the same thing to bring social securityinto the 21st century i think is a paper tiger on their side of the aisle what we have done and i thank my colleague from pennsylvania for putting this special hour together tonight besides the prescription drug part which is significant and i will not spend my time talking about that but i want to talk a little bit about the modernization part of medicare in that historic 2003 bill medicare was a little later coming to us than social security social security came along in 1935 1936 and it was not until 1965 that the medicare bill as part of social security was offered to our seniors it has been a great program but at its outset it was all about episodic care part a was hospital treatment nursing home a little bit of home health care and part b of course the optional part the premiumbased part of medicare was for the provider services the physician or outpatient hospital procedures durable medical equipment certain drugs as the gentleman from louisiana pointed out earlier but only those that are administered by an injection not something that you could get by a prescription the original medicare and as the argument against it again from the other side of the aisle back a year and a half ago was they are about to take away medicare as you know it well thank god if we did that thank god and thank the republican majority because now instead of treating people when they have a heart attack when they fall over at home in the shower having had a stroke because their high blood pressure was never treated never even recognized until it is too late and then you get into the really really expensive part of health care that longterm hospital stay that ambulance trip to the emergency room that nursing home stay until you have exhausted all of your benefits and all of a sudden you end up destitute and covered by medicaid no senior wants to be in that situation but what we did in the modernization part most of the attention yes was the prescription drug benefit the optional part d benefit that was finally delivered by this president finally fulfilled a promise that had been made and broken really by so many previous congresses and administrations but the modernization part if my colleague will further yield i wanted to talk about that because we never got the opportunity to just go to the doctor and have a physical exam as i said it was always if one has got chest pain if they got a nose bleed if they have a stroke then they get covered under medicare but with the modernization program that we passed in december of 2003 when a person turns 65 and first becomes eligible for medicare now medicare will pay for a complete a complete headtotoe thorough physical examination by a primary health care provider a family practitioner or a general internist and these are the diagnosticians a lot of times people will refer to those specialists as diagnosticians and indeed they are they are the real medical sleuths that can detect disease before the patient has any idea that something is going amiss in their body i am talking about a slight elevation of blood sugar or a slight elevation of blood pressure or maybe a person is getting a little short of breath and that internist or primary care doctor knows that they need some specific tests to rule out things like coronary artery disease or to institute some prescription medication those physical examinations in the past were not covered under medicare it seems ridiculous but back when we started the system nobody really thought that that was that important just as they did not think that prescription medication was so important but we know now today that if we can detect these diseases as they are starting before the patient has had a significant complication to treat it to treat it as we say medically with yes prescription druks that now these seniors can finally afford and those that are at or near the federal poverty level they can literally get prescription medications to treat one of these diseases at its inception by paying 1 or 3 or maybe at the maximum a 5 copay for a prescription that may have cost hundreds of dollars if they did not have this benefit so i am very pleased to be here tonight as part ofthis hour this special order with my colleagues many of them health care providers to remind our colleagues on both sides of the aisle what we have already done in regard to trying to fix the medicare program and in the process of course to provide much greater care a better standard of care 21stcentury medicine to our seniors who deserve that and have been waiting really so long for it they get that entrylevel physical examination so that some of these catastrophic things do not happen to them and if they choose in january of 2006 to have signed up for the optional part d as 96 percent have signed up for the optional part b the doctor part then i think we are going to see some costshifting in this program yes it is an expensive program and certainly the prescription drug part is going to be a big expensive number i do not know exactly what it is but what i do know is that the number crunchers whether it is within the centers for medicare medicaid services or whether it is the congressional budget office or the office of management and budget from the administration that have given us a number and we heard 400 billion over 10 years and then we heard 520 billion over 10 years and now we are hearing 750 or 950 i do not know but i do know this that no credit is given for the possibility the distinct possibility that because of the prescription drug benefit because of the initial complete physical when a senior turns 65 because of the multiple screening tests that are now paid for under medicare on an annual or every2year basis and i am talking about cholesterol screening i am talking about pap smears for women to detect early cervical cancer or ovarian cancer i am talking about colon cancer screening flexible sigmoid tests or colonoscopies i am talking about osteoporosis screening doing all of these things bringing medicare into the 21st century is going to prevent some of these catastrophic very expensive things from occurring so while we are spending a little bit more money on that and maybe a lot more money finally offering a prescription drug part we are going to save money on hospitalizations we are going to save money on fewer days in a nursing home we are going to prevent people from ending up with a stroke and yes indeed maybe being in a vegetative state for 15 or 20 years and we just talked about that last week in the congress and know how expensive that kind of care is so really what we have done and i am going to close with this mr speaker and yield back to the gentleman from pennsylvania but what we have done in modernizing medicare and not ignoring it as the other side would suggest is we have done the right thing we have done the compassionate thing for our seniors and we have done the costeffective thing and i thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for

shadegg has just articulated is a plague on our society across america i have worked extensively on human trafficking issues and see them often repeated in our own jurisdictions in texas it is actually 20thcentury human bondage and the tragedy is that many of these individuals are women young women who are forced to come to the united states and are abused and utilized not only in areas of prostitution but also areas of hard work where they are not able to receive adequate compensation according to the state department the state department estimates between 15 000 and 20 000 people are trafficked into the united states every year worldwide there are approximately 600 000 to 800 000 people trafficked across international borders every year victims of human trafficking are often forced into prostitution hard labor child soldiering and other forms of involuntary servitude in effect they become slaves it is shameful to say that this occurs in the united states it is shameful to say that it is still going on in the 21st century but i believe if we cut off the money supply of human traffickers charging them with money laundering it is a reasonable step to take in addressing

our colleagues in the united states senate are imminently approaching a crossroads that will forever impact the future of this republic they will choose the road that will restore the constitutional balance of power that our founding fathers so carefully constructed or they will travel down that path that rewards a shameless behavior that has deliberately injured this delicate balance by transferring the executive power of judicial appointment to the legislative minority the constitutions advice and consent has been twisted into mockery by the senate minority men and women of outstanding character have come forth as judicial nominees to be undeservedly maligned smeared ridiculed and then left in nominations limbo indefinitely by this unprecedented unconstitutional and outrageous judicial filibuster this is a show of disregard and contempt for the worlds flagship of freedom and toward her people and toward the timehonored principles of the united states senate we will recapture the civility that once presided over judicial appointments or we will forever surrender what abraham lincoln called the angels of our better nature to this bitterly partisan tactic that threatens the constitutional prerogative of the president of the united states to appoint good decent and honorable men and women to the federal judiciary advice and consent is clearly written in the united states constitution this judicial filibuster to prevent a fair upordown vote is neither advice nor consent and it is not in the united states constitution never before 2003 in 214 years of unitedstates senate deliberations has any judicial nomination supported by the majority of the senate been denied a fair upordown vote yet the minority would have the public believe that the majority is the one trying to change the rules here calling it the nuclear option it is the senate minority that has launched this unprecedented quote nuclear option by devastating the constitutionally required just consideration of judicial nominees duly appointed by the president of the united states what the majority seeks is the constitutional option that is totally in keeping with 214 years of the rules traditions and dignity of the united states senate senate democrats have strongly and arrogantly and openly threatened to shut down the operations of the government if republicans insist on the constitutional option i would suggest that it is far better to let the democrats shut down this government temporarily than it is to allow them to shut down this republic permanently in this critical struggle for the future of this republic one of two things will occur either the timehonored and tested provision of advice and consent written in the constitution will prevail or unprecedented judicial filibuster and obstructionism will take its place and become the tragic legacy of these days i should not have to remind my republican colleagues that the people who have entrusted us with this majority have spoken with resounding voice on the issue of judicial nominations they hear it and i hear it everywhere i go the people of america have a profound sense of fair play and they are tired of some of their united states senators cowering behind a distorted version of the true and impeccable auspices of the united states senate the people want their senators to have the courage to take a stand on judicial nominations the people want a fair upordown vote on judges and they will remember those who have the courage to do so and sir they will remember those who did not the people understand how important this really is they understand that it is truly about the constitution itself and they innately embrace the core message of those magnificent words by daniel webster when he said hold on my friends to the constitution and to the republic for which it stands for miracles do not cluster and what has happened once in 6 000 years may never happen again so hold on to the constitution for if the american constitution should fall there will be anarchy throughout the world the stakes could not be higher and this republic truly hangs in the balance we

federal fish hatcheries located in the towns of wytheville and paint bank in my congressional district to the state of virginia for continued operation by the virginia department of game and inland fisheries the legislation enjoys wide support and no opposition the unitedstates fish and wildlife services as well as the state of virginia both endorse the conveyance of these two properties the two facilities have been operated by the virginia department of game and inland fisheries since 1983 under a 25 year lease agreement in the early 1980s the federal government was in the process of divesting some federal hatcheries which were not involved in fish stock mitigation activities the wytheville and paint bank hatcheries are not used forfish stock mitigation and breed fish for recreational fishing onlyboth facilities provide brook brown and rainbow trout for the stocking of streams on federal lands at that time virginia expressed interest in operating the facilities under a 25 year lease agreement and the state has been operating the facilities since that time the lease is set to expire in 2008 and all parties are in agreement that a title transfer before that expiration date is appropriate the two facilities have an estimated combined economic effect of 40 million annually and produced a combined total of approximately 290 729 pounds of trout during fiscal year 2005 since beginning operation of the facilities under the lease agreement the state has made numerous investments in the two hatcheres the state has invested approximately 159 350 for improvements to the wytheville facility and approximately 230 000 at the paint bank facility in addition during that time the facilities have been thoroughly tested for various contaminants and there are now no contaminant issues associated with either hatchery the state would like to continue operation and investment in the facilities for a variety of reasons for example in order for extensive capital expenditures or any federal funding to be used for additional improvements the ownership must be transferred from the federal govemnment given the fact that the state of virginia would like to assume ownership and that the federal government has been making a broad effort to divest of nonmitigation related hatcheries this conveyance is in the interest of all parties h r 5051 would simply transfer

public helping patients and the families cope with the challenges of injury and illness unfortunately as we hear too often we are facing a serious shortage of nurses and that shortage is growing so

talking about reauthorizing the voting rights act which mycommittee will be dealing with shortly as well as overturning the supreme courts erroneous decision in the case of kelo v city of new london connecticut which basically said that there were no constitutional protections against a municipality using eminent domain to take a persons private property simply because the city fathers and mothers decided that there would be a way to get more tax revenue out of that piece of land that bill has passed the house of representatives and is currently pending in the other bpdy and i hope we can have eminent domain reform passed during this session of congress as well as the reauthorization of the voting rights act mr speaker i submit for inclusion at this point in the record the speech that i gave to the naacp convention in milwaukee on july 10 2005 good evening thank you for this opportunity to talk briefly about two important issues facing us right now an extension of the voting rights act and the supreme courts recent 54 decision in the kelo case which held that the government can use economic development as a reason for taking private property among my proudest moments was accompanying members of the naacp and dr marsha colemanadebayo for the signing of the no fear act legislation that aims to stamp out discrimination in federal agencies the bipartisan passage of no fear the first civil rights legislation of the 21st century should serve as a model for future civil rights bills on august 5 2005 the united states will celebrate the 40th anniversary of one of the most significant pieces of legislation enacted during the 20th centurythe voting rights act this profound legislation pushed back againist those unwilling to treat all citizens as equals and restored the dignity aid equality that our constitution is intended to preserve for all citizens our democratic system of government has as its most fundamental right the right of its citizens to participate in the political process adopted 135 years ago the 15th afnendment ensures that no american citizens right to vote can be denied or abridged by the united states or a state on account of race color or previous condition of servitude as far too many here know and have experienced some government entities have not only been unfaithful to the rights and protections afforded by the constitution but have aggressivelyand sometimes viol lentlytried to disenfranchise africanamerican and other minority voters in his momentous speech delivered to congress on march 15 1965 president lyndon b johnson stated xperience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination no law that we now have on the booksand i have helped to put three of them therecan ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it in such a case our duty must be clear to all of us the constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his raceor color we have all sworn an oath before god to support and to defend that constitution we must now act in obedience to that oath seeing the voting rights acts impact compelled me in 1982 to lead the house republican effort to extend it for 25 years this effort wasnt easybut then again very important things never are while i proudly display in my washifigton office one of the pens president ronald reagan used to sign this extension the fruits of this effort can best be seen on the faces of those not only participating in the political process but actively leading it in the 1960s all major civil rights legislation was passed with strong bipartisan support lately this has not been the case as some have tried to use the issue of civil rights to obtain a partisan advantage this is both wrong and shortsighted the stakes have not been higher in the past 20 years in 2007 several key protections contained in the voting rights act will expire including the federal oversight protections provided by section 5 i am here to tell yoif publicly what i have told others privately including the head of the congressional black caucus representative mel wattduring this congress we are going to extend the voting rights act i am not alone in the congress in supporting an extension indeed house speaker dennis hastert last week stated that reauthorization of the voting rights act is high on his list of issues the house will address this congress soon i will be introducing legislation to extend the voting rights act just like its enactment and its 1982 extension this bipartisan effort will succeed ladies and gentlemen while we have made progress and curtailed injustices thank to the voting rights act our work is not yet complete we cannot let discriminatory practices of the past resurface to threaten future gains the voting rights act must continue to existand exist in its current form i also want to mention my strong opposition to the supreme courts recent 54 decision in the kelo case which held that the government can use economic development as a reason for taking private property from one small homneowner and gi ing it to a large corporation simply because the corporations greater wealth will bring the government more tax revenue as the naacp so correctly noted in its brief filed with the supreme court in the kelo case the takings that result from the courts decision will disproportionately affect and harm the economically disadvantaged and in particular racial and ethnic minorities and the elderly the noxious practice endorsed by the courts kelo decision has generated bipartisan opposition last week i introduced h r 3135 the private property rights protection act of 2005 with the ranking member of the judiciary committee mr conyers as the lead democratic cosponsor and representatives maxine waters sheila jacksonlee and 87 additional members as original cosponsors this legislation would prevent the federal government from using economic development as a justification for taking privatelyowned property it would also prohibit any state or municipality from doing so whenever federal funds are involved with the project for which the governments takings power is exercised american taxpayers should not be forced to contribute in any way to the abuse of government power one mans home must not become a hotel or strip mall solely because the government seeks more tax revenue i am looking forward to working with you and all organizations opposed to the supreme courts kelo decision we must ensure that churches homes farms and other private property cannot be bulldozed in abusive land grabs that benefit other private individuals who claim that their use of the land will increase tax revenues last week america celebrated the
