education services cuts 1 7 billion from labor with cuts to workforce development and safety investments and cuts more than 1 billion from critical health programs and next week we will be forced to vote on this bill that undermines so many of our nations priorities why because the republican house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations and here we are again voting on a measure that would provide over 50 billion to the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers how much is enough when will republicans be satisfied with the amount of money they have given to the wealthy and turn their attention to the majority of americans who want a good education a strong work force and a healthy future this bill will cost 50 billion per year when fully phased in this monstrous hole in the federal budget will undoubtedly translate into cuts from areas that the american people care about just as the proposed 175 billion republican tax cut translated into cuts in yesterdays proposed labor hhs education appropriations bill when we prioritize tax cuts over health education and labor we make sacrifices and these sacrifices affect everybody the repeal of the estate tax does nothing for working families most american families would not receive a single dollar of tax relief from this bill so i want the american people to know what they are

the republican leadership indicated they wanted to solve the problem of our budget caps by providing for a 13month fiscal year i want to say today that i enthusiastically support that plan and i urge that the new month be named orwellian the reason i say that is because george orwell in his famous novel 1984 began that novel with the words it was a bright cold day in april and the clocks were striking 13 i think there are 10 advantages of a 13month year as the republican leadership is suggesting first of all everyone could take 8 percent off their age adding 1 month to the year reduces the number of years we have lived by 8 percent second we could bring back ronald reagan as president by making this retroactive we could arrange it so that it is 1984 all over again which is what the republicans have been trying to do for years that would be appropriate because it was with the reagan budgets that the deficit first exploded and put us where it is today third it could add 30 more shopping days till christmas that would add immeasurably to economic growth although it could cause the economy to overheat which might cause alan greenspan to raise interest rates fourth it could give every child in america 1 month more of summer vacation that could add to economic growth in the tourist and resort industries as people have more time to travel fifth as an alternative we could add 1 month to the work year that could add to worker productivity and raise economic growth that way sixth it would help at least two more major league baseball players to join mark mcgwire and sammy

millions more to add to the economic strength of baseball and to the economy in general seventh it would make all taxpayers happy by delaying tax filing deadlines by 1 month eighth it could give republicans 1 extra month to complete their budget although at the rate they are going that probably would not make any difference ninth it could delay the y2k problem by 1 month if the month is

reform or managed care reform one of the things that i want to really stress is that there is a major difference between the approach that the democrats have been taking on the issue of hmo reform versus the approach of the republican leadership a lot of times i worry that americans and our constituents think that what we are proposing on both sides of the aisle is essentially the same and that everyone is trying to do something to protect patients rights during this managed care reform debate but i just think it is important to stress the differences i really feel very strongly that the patients bill of rights the democratic bill that has been put forward and is cosponsored by almost every member on the democratic side really protects patients rights whereas the republican leadership bills that have been put forward both in this congress and in the previous congress really do not do an adequate job of protecting patients and too often look towards the interests of the insurance industry instead in the last session of congress in the last 2 years in 1997 and 1998 there was some debate on the issue of hmo reform but the issue was essentially left unfinished in the 105th congress in the last congress on the house side the democrats patients bill of rights was defeated by just five votes when it came to the floor it was considered on the floor as a substitute to the republican leaderships managed care bill which did pass and which in my opinion was really not a good piece of legislation and did not do anything significant to protect patients in fact the republican leadership in the house has reintroduced a bill in this session of congress that is virtually identical to what it moved last year on the senate side the senate republicans in the socalled help committee approved a managed care bill which really in my opinion is a sham reform bill and does not allow patients to sue the insurance companies but does allow the insurance companies and not the doctors and patients to define what is medically necessary what types of procedures what length of stay what kind of operations would be performed and would be acceptable under an individual insurance policy i just wanted to if i could take a little time this evening to talk about why this republican bill that passed the senate the republican leadership bill in the senate really does not do an adequate job of trying to protect patients rights if you look at the bill that passed the senate or that came out of committee i should say in the senate this year it leaves out more than 100 million americans twothirds of those with private health insurance it fails to grant key protections needed by children women persons with disabilities and others with chronic conditions or special health care needs and it allows medical decisions to continue to be made by insurance company executives instead of by health care professionals and patients the main difference that i have tried to point out between the democrats patients bill of rights and the republican leadership bills that have been sponsored in the house or in the senate really come down to two points and that is that the republican bills really leave it up to the insurance companies to decide what kind of treatment you are going to get and with regard to enforcement they do not have adequate enforcement because if you want to appeal a decision about your treatment that you felt that you should have a particular operation you should be able to stay an extra day or so in the hospital if you try that appeal there is really no process whereby you can appeal the decision of the insurance company and be successful and certainly if you suffer damages you cannot sue for those damages under the republican bill what the democrats tried to do on the senate side in committee in the help committee when this republican hmo bill came up they tried a number of times through amendments to improve the republican bill all those democratic amendments were essentially defeated but i wanted to give you a little idea if i could about the kinds of things that the democrats were trying to do to improve what was essentially a bad bill that did not provide adequate protections for patients in hmos the committee republicans in the senate rejected on a 108 party line vote an amendment by senator ted kennedy to extend the scope of the bill to all privately insured americans as i said the republican bill leaves more than 100 million people unprotected because most of its patient protections are narrowly applied to only one type of insurance and that is selffunded employer plans the committee republicans also rejected on the same 108 party line vote senator kennedys amendment on external appeals again as i mentioned before the republican bill does not create a truly independent external review of plan decisions so if you feel that you are not getting covered adequately and you try to appeal there really is no effective external appeal under the committee bill the republican bill the socalled external review is controlled by the hmos and contains loopholes to allow hmos to delay or prevent patients from appealing a bad medical decision by an hmo bureaucrat many hmo decisions could not even be appealed under the republican bill just to give you another idea of some of the examples i talked about the issue of medical necessity and how it is defined the committee republicans in the senate rejected again on a party line vote 108 an amendment offered by senator kennedy to define the term medical necessity and to prohibit hmos from arbitrarily interfering with medical decisions again just to give you an example of how this operates this amendment would have prevented insurers from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of the treating physician on issues relating to the manner in other words the length of stay in the hospital or the setting inpatient versus outpatient care it would have stopped hmos from overruling doctor and going against accepted and best practices of medicine the committee republicanpassed bill does nothing to protect patients when an insurance company bureaucrat tells them they must have a medical procedure on an outpatient basis or be discharged from the hospital prematurely the republican bill allows hmos to continue to define what is medically necessary giving them the ability to deny promised benefits another example the issue of emergency room care many of my constituents have complained to me that their hmo policy does not allow them to go to the emergency room when they think it is necessary or they have to go to a different hospital that is pretty far away if they want to go to an emergency room they cannot go to the hospital near where they live or where they work well senator murray tried to put in an amendment that again was rejected on a party line vote 108 to strengthen coverage for emergency care under the republican bill it is not clear whether a true prudent layperson standard applies to all of the plans covered prudent layperson says that if the average prudent person would think it was necessary to go to the emergency room then you can go to whatever emergency room is close by and readily available well many insurance policies many hmos do not allow that and so the democrats are saying we want to have that prudent layperson standard put into the hmo reform bill instead what happened is that in this case again the ability to apply that prudent layperson standard was rejected by the committee and what that means is that under the republican bill there still is no guarantee that you can go to the closest emergency room or that even if you go to the emergency room and later the hmo decides well you really should not have gone because it was not really an emergency that they can just deny coverage and say you shouldnt have gone to the emergency room therefore were not going to pay for the emergency room care another example that i think is important is with regard to specialists many of my constituents complain that their hmo reform bill does not provide them with access to specialists that they may need in a given circumstance senators harein and reed had an amendment to this republican bill that again was rejected along party lines that would ensure that patients have access to needed specialists under the republican bill patients could be charged more for outofnetwork specialty care even if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists within the plan so if you decide that you want to go to a doctor i will give you an example perhaps you want to go see a pediatrician but as many people know today that for children there are pediatric specialists for different areas of pediatrics under the republican bill if there is nobody that has that specialty and you decide that you want to see that kind of pediatrician for your child then you can go out of the network but you have to pay for it again what we were saying with this democratic amendment is that access to specialty care should be provided outside the hmo if there is no one within the hmo that has that specialty and is part of the network but again that was an amendment that was rejected i will only mention one more effort on the democrats part to try to improve this bad bill if you will and there are many others but i will only mention one other one and that was senator kennedys amendment again rejected on a 108 party line vote with regard to liability the republican bill fails to hold limos accountable when their actions result in injury or death i mentioned this before you cannot sue the republican plan would protect most hmos from liability even when someone becomes disabled or is killed senator kennedys amendment in the democrats patients bill of rights would allow 123 million patients who receive coverage through private employers to hold their hmos and health insurance plans accountable under state laws for their abuses this is one of the loopholes if you will in the current law and that is that if you are not covered by certain state laws and your health insurance comes from your private employer oftentimes you cannot sue we were trying to correct that as well if i could just say that basically what i am trying to point out tonight is that there are major differences here and that when we look at what is happening on the issue of hmo or managed care reform it is obviously important that we have an opportunity in this session of congress to get a vote on this issue one of the criticisms that i have of the republican leadership is that frankly it is now april almost may and they have not even allowed us to have any kind of a vote there has not been any movement in subcommittee in the committee on commerce that i am a member of or in the full committee to bring any kind of hmo or managed care reform to the floor so we need to at least start the movement but when that movement starts and when we do have an opportunity to vote on hmo reform we have to understand that there is a major difference between the patients bill of rights which is being brought forth by the democrats and the republican leadership proposal now you do not have to take my word for it one of the things that i think is important is that we look at some of the commentators and what they are saying about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on this issue but i wanted to read if i could all or some parts of an editorial that appeared in the new york times on saturday april 10 earlier this month that talked about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on the issue of patient rights just about everyone on capitol hill professes interest in producing legislation that protects patients from unfair health insurance practices but the prospect of actually passing meaningful protections as opposed to talking about it is uncertain president clinton tried to whip up support for democratic proposals but the republicans are balking at democratic plans as too burdensome on the managed care industry yet it is the democratic proposals that more fully reflect the recommendations of a presidential advisory commission to improve health plan quality the republican senate bill s 326 sponsored by senator jeffords of vermont is too limited to accomplish that purpose the bill which was approved by the senate help or health education labor and pensions committee on a straight party line vote of 108 contains some consumer protections but it is unacceptable because most of the provisions would apply only to 48 million individuals covered by plans in which large employers act as their own insurers leaving 110 million americans in other plans unprotected the republican bill would grant appeal rights to an additional 75 million privately insured individuals but those rights would be quite restrictive appeals to an external reviewer would be allowed only when an insurer refused to pay for a procedure on the grounds that it was not medically necessary or was experimental critics say this would give health plans power to limit appeals by simply asserting that a denial is not based on medical necessity it would exclude appeals where a plan unilaterally decided that the benefit was not covered under the contract even if medical judgments were involved in that contract interpretation the republican bill does not adequately ensure access to specialty care by allowing a patient to see an outofnetwork specialist if the plan has an insufficient number of specialists available both the senate democratic proposal which has white house support and a bipartisan bill sponsored by senators john chafee joseph lieberman and others would be substantially stronger in allowing external review of coverage disputes and defining medical necessity and in giving enrollees greater rights to take health plans to court the insurance lobby has already embarked on a media blitz to defeat any new regulations as too costly but consumer protections under the democratic plan would increase health plan costs by only 2 8 percent according to congressional budget office estimates made last year health plans should be made to deliver what they promise their enrollees and held accountable when they fail i think that new york times editorial really sums up what i am trying to say tonight which is the fact of the matter is that if the patients bill of rights the democratic patients bill of rights would be substantially stronger in almost every aspect of managed care reform over the republican proposal now i just wanted to briefly mention again the important areas where the patients bill of rights a democratic bill of rights really provides for a very good protection for patients once again and most importantly the democratic patients bill of rights allows doctors and patients rather than insurance company bureaucrats to make medical decisions using the principles of good medicine in addition it would first guarantee access to needed health care specialists the democratic bill provides access to emergency room services when and where the need arises the democratic bill provides continuity of care protections to assure patient care if a patients health care provider is dropped the democrats patients bill of rights gives access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process and the democratic patients bill of rights assures that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment options and not be gagged because the insurance company says that you cannot talk about something that is not covered the patients bill of rights would also assure that women have direct access to ob gyn and finally and almost as important really as the medical necessity issue is that the democrats patients bill of rights provides an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been maimed or die as a result of health plan actions i sound very partisan this evening and i do not mean to suggest that there are not republican members on the other side of the aisle that are supportive of the patients bill of rights or the types of protections that i think that are needed in a comprehensive hmo reform bill i know that there are members on the other side that would like to see these types of protections provided under the law but the bottom line is that the republican leadership which is in charge of the house keeps producing legislation or keeps proposing legislation both in the house and in the senate that does not adequately protect patients and i think it is very important that we not only move ahead in this session of congress and quickly on hmo reform but that we move ahead with an hmo reform that adequately protects patients rights that is comprehensive and addresses what i consider the major issue that my constituents and most americans seem to be concerned about at this time"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.754999190568924, 0.24500080943107605, 1, "i agree with the gentleman from texas chairman archer this tax code is so perverse

from iowa would say that he was addressing his remarks to the people at home because i would be embarrassed to tell the people at home that i am supporting a bill that never went through any committee in the house of representatives it is just that someone woke up in the middle of the night and said let us give a message to the people at home last night the message would have been that we would reduce the budget by 7 5 billion but that was not a sufficient message for the people at home that would not fly in going to the convention so we say let us reduce it by 90 billion or whatever the new numbers are going to be one does not reduce deficits just by standing on the floor proclaiming what one wants to do one does not reduce the deficit by just trying to find out what is the new surplus under the clintongore administration what has been announced and then as soon as one does oneadds it to the list of tax cuts that one has had that so far is 611 billion then too one has to restrain ones spending the people at home know that the only way to reduce debt is to increase revenue or to decrease spending so what my colleagues are trying to do is to do both but since we know that this is merely a proclamation for the people at home and since we know that nobody in this house is against the concept and since we know that the gentleman that is supporting the bill on this side belongs

out here with all the fanfare in 1995 the marriage tax penalty wasin it when the first tax bill came to the committee on ways and means i offered an amendment to remove the marriage tax penalty in the committee on ways and means every single republican on the committee voted against it the only reason we could say they did it i suppose was kind of nih not invented here they did not have their name on it so they came back the next year after they had done the polling and realized they had made a mistake and they have been trying ever since but they always wrap it in a humongous tax cut now none of us believe that we will leave this session without a cut in the marriage tax penalty i will be willing to bet anybody on this floor that when we sign off and leave here about october 1 we will have agreed with the president on a middleclass tax cut on the marriage penalty what is amazing is what the gentleman from new york just talked about the meeting that happened in the white house yesterday the speaker of the house came and said we have a plan 90 percent goes for debt relief and 10 percent goes for investment if we take all the taxes that have been pushed by the republicans and are pushed by mr bush of 1 7 trillion and we only have 5 5 trillion if we have a calculator in our pockets which the speaker ought to have we realize that that is 31 percent of the projected surplus that is going for tax cuts we cannot do it in 10 percent it is 3 times as much as we left on the table so either the republicans on the floor are walking away from mr bush and his tax cut which i think most of them are or they simply are trying to put a fraud out on the people that they can do 90 percent for bringing down the debt and 10 percent and there is no money left for investment no money for social security no money for medicare no money for education none of the issues that we ought to be doing with the surplus the american people are faced in this election with a choice will we have a big tax cut or will we invest in the future most americans are interested in protecting their retirement their social security their medicare which is really security im health areas they are interested in educating their kids to deal with this economy so we do not have to bring in under the h1b visa hundreds of thousands of people from around the world because we say our own kids are not

should be talking about a sunrise a sunrise for tax reform i am very disappointed that we do not have legislation on the floor that would talk about tax reform because we do need tax reform what this legislation represents is a failure a failure by this body to take up tax reform a signal that we will not deal with it in this congress the third consecutive congress under the control of the republicans in which they have not brought tax reform to the floor of this house if my colleagues are looking for agreement on both sides of the aisle we agree that the current income tax code is too complicated so what do we do about it during these past 3 terms add another 100 sections and make it more complicated make it more difficult for our constituents to understand how to file their tax returns that is not tax reform those actions became law if my colleagues want agreement on both sides of the aisle that we should have less income taxes they will get that agreement let us bring forward bills that do it i strongly support the expansion of the earned income tax credit that has helped many taxpayers get the relief that they need but we sometimes find that on the other side of the aisle they fight us on that type of legislation or targeted relief that would let less people need to file income tax returns in our country but no they do not seem to want to do it that way so why not work together on tax reform so that we can really get something done in this congress rather than having a tool that is just basically used for the 30second commercial that does not befit this body and the tragedy is that if this legislation were to become law what would be the consequences the first thing is we would not know what the tax revenue system of this country would be what advice would my colleagues give to their constituents their young married couple who wants to purchase a home but needs to know the tax consequences of that home purchase in order to make sure that their budget makes sense to buy that home what will they tell them when there is no tax code in place and we have not quite figured out what the revenue code will be for our country the uncertainty will be very damaging to american families that is not what we should be doing and then what tax code will we put into effect i know there has been a lot of debate about this quite frankly i have a good tax plan that i would like to be able to talk about and if we bring a bill to the floor i will certainly be offering an alternative or amendments to that tax bill but the reason why we use the retail sales tax is because that is the one i think our constituents understand the best to allow us some ability to compare between one tax code and the other if we translate what the repeal of all income taxes is on a retail sales tax that is 59 5 percent added to the price of all goods all services that is not my estimate that is the joint tax committees estimate i do not want to be responsible for

500 billion liability that is what it cost to clean up that mess now at the same time the banks by engaging in questionable practices wound up in a situation where the fed and the treasury department had to bail them out also at the taxpayers expense but it did not show having said that what we are creating now is a group of institutions which are too big to fail not only are they going to be big banks but they are going to be big everything because they are going to be in securities and insurance in issuance of stocks and bonds and underwriting and they are also going to be in banks and under

regard to your privacy and this is everything from your health to your financial situation to everything else is we are going to stick it to you the privacy that you are going to have under this

for the 10 programs to the states the states in turn collectively distributed 94 percent of that money to the local districts then we hear that well all the money is really being spent by the local districts in filling out papers and complying with all of these rules the gao sent investigators to nine school districts they did indepth evaluation and discussion with the personnel in those districts and here is what they concluded this is not the democratic party concluding this or the republican party concluding this this is the gao which i think has as their motto is on the front page a reputation for dependability and integrity and here is what they said we found that school level staff spent very little time administering the programs and the district office staff also generally spend little time administering them so it seems to me that we are here discussing in large part a problem that exists only in the minds of the majority title i less than 1 percent of the funds spent

of this legislation and of the program they indicate that they think that the figure is somewhat higher than that originally we had talked about 18 that did not happen they mentioned 16 their formula figure may take it above that we are obviously not going to solve that issue here today but i would hope that the gentleman would continue to consult with these supporters of the programs and certainly with the state wildlife agencies that are administering the state side of that program because i think they do raise the concerns about that i do not know that exact figure yet however i believe it is higher than the figure the gentleman has in his budget i would just hope that that could be done certainly before we contemplate sending this legislation to the white house"], [0.02266708016395569, 0.4773329198360443, 1, "we have contained within the interior appropriations from past years an embedded tax a tax on the american people which was never authorized by the committee on resources or the committee on ways and means the two committees that would split jurisdiction over taxes or fees if it is a fee on use of public land let us get one thing clear the amendment being offered today does not affect user fees for national parks for developed areas and campsites but what it would say is that it is outrageous for the government in a mishmash aplethora of programs forest by forest to have different reciprocities between forests and i have one forest where they have two different passes that they proliferate the new fee programs forest by forest charging people 25 a hit or 3 a day to drive to the end of a gravel road in a forest and go for a hike or view the wildflowers or go hunting or go rockhunting rockhounding these activities have traditionally been free these are not activities which are drawing upon a capitalintensive developed site yet with this socalled pilot program unauthorized program millions of americans are now breaking the law this year the forest service is going to begin seriously attempting to cite and prosecute people who park at distant remote trailheads trailheads that are often subject to car clouting and other problems the forest service does not seem to be too much concerned about that but they are going to be out there ticketing them for not having paid a fee in many cases you get to the end of a road the sign is about 150 feet to the end of the road and it says to park here you need a pass and you can obtain a pass 20 miles back that way at the nearest grocery store or other place which dispenses these passes this is an inconvenience it raises very little money it is about 6 percent of the recreation budget surely this congress does not need to double tax the american people and those who live on or near or recreate on these lands and charge them this new user fee this new tax we can find that other 6 percent to fund the recreation programs of the forest service further we are adding a new slush fund to an agency that the gao says they have one of the worst financial management and accounting systems and now we have another new offbudget slush fund which is being used by each forest as they see fit and as the assistant secretary admitted to me last night with no supervision from washington d c so whatever fees they cook up for whatever project they want to do whatever burden they want to put on the american people they can do it with no oversight from washington d c or from the congress under this unauthorized program the committee itself says they are concerned about the management accountability and performance of the forest service the accountability problems of the forest service are much more of a problem than just bad accounting far too much with little congressional control and knowledge has been transferred for administrative functions of the department this program this socalled pilot program goes right to the heart of those concerns the committee was talking about a different program at that point c v fund but guess what they have just now created another one that is proliferating around the country around the country and putting an extraordinary burden on people take say the city of oak ridge oregon in my district totally surrounded by the forest service if you just want to drive out of town and park on a gravel road and go hunting or go for a hike you have to pay a user fee for what to use the gravel road which was built 25 years ago for logging and is not maintained anymore or for beating through the brush why why should people pay for undeveloped sites on access to public lands this has been a right that americans have enjoyed for so many years and it is very unfair to begin to assess a fee of 3 per hike or 25 per pass per forest with very little reciprocity on one forest in oregon the deschutes visitors to the lavaland visitors center dropped off 40percent in one year when this pilot project was put into effect as was stated in an interview the people at the visitors center said the people drive up look at the sign they turn around they drive away a 40percent dropoff why so they can buy a few more little geegaws for that visitors center or make some other change on the forest we should not be depriving americans and their families of this opportunity it is unfair it is unauthorized it should be stopped"]]}
