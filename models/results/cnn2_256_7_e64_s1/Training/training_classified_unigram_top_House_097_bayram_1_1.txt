depression there has not been a time when a strong agriculture appropriation bill is needed more agriculture is experiencing its 3d straight year of falling income the usda recently announced its estimate of 1982 agricultural income at 19 billion down from 19 6 in 1981 and 24 4 in the cost price squeeze continues with prices paid by farmers increasing while their incomes have fallen farm

june 1 33 9 percent of the loans by farmers home administration were delinquent i will not go on but i could what is most important for me to get across is that the agricultural industry must recover if we are to expect recovery in the rest of the economy being larger than the auto steel and housing industry combined and with more workers than any other industry agriculture has a very large impact on the general economy a recent study completed by chase econometrics shows that full recovery cannot be achieved without recovery in the agricultural sector the study shows that depressed farm prices are causing a national loss of 2 2 billion in gross national product 4 billion in disposable personal income and 2 8 in net farm exports contrary to other industries agriculture is not undercapitalized or suffering from a decline in productivity rather it is a victim of its own sucuess our food production capacity is the envy of the world it provides the basis for american consumers to spend less of their disposable income on food than any other group of people in the world however when our production is greater than demand it means bad times on the farm and ranch one note about our abundance and that is to say that supply is only large relative to demand anyone who is knowledgeable about our international market will agree that this industrys marketing bare has been ruined by embargo after embargo and the food weapon has been used at considerable detriment to our demand side of the marketing cquation the small amount of funds provided in this bill for agricultural programs is needed to help repair embargo market damage and protect our most important natural resourcethe food producing capacity of american agriculture the committee provides 1 023 billion for agriculture research and extension activities this is 34 million more than last year and demonstrates our commitment to maintaining the critical scientific work that has been probably the most important factor in expanding our production and efficiency science must now play a leading role in finding new uses for our products pioneering less expensive methods of production developing systems that do a better job of preserving our soil and water resources and delivering that know how to the producers through our cooperative research service for protection of plants and animals from pests and disease the committee has provided 268 milliondown slightly from last yearbut at adequate levels to continue the battle against disease and pests the committee has decided to restore funding for such control programs as goldern nematode grasshopper gypsy moth imported fire ant witchweed and several other important programs that have proven effective over the years rural development through the activities of the farmers home administration is funded at levels that will allow the department to maintain or in some cases increase its participation levels we have provided the request for higher fmha operating loan levels to see that producers have more adequate access to last resort lending during these hard times the rural electrification administration is continued at virtually the same levels as last year rea has provided a critical link in facilitating the modern and efficient agriculture we see today it has also improve the living standard of our rural population if it were not for past rural electrification programs our rural people would not enjoy the conveniences of modern day living in an effort to halt our very serious land and water erosion problem our committee has restored as we are forced to every year the funds for conservation and forestry efforts almost every major publication in this country has run stories on our critical erosion situation our intensive farming practices and push for volume to make up for low prices has agrivated the loss of our farmland producers cannot bear the expensive erosion control measures by themselves it is to societys benefit that everyone join in the effort to preserve our natural resource base as my chairman has said so many timesall real wealth is linked to the soil and if we destroy that resource we are destroying our foundation as i mentioned earlier the food and nutrition programs that provide the needed assistance for lowincome americans are also funded in this bill the committee has only provided the presidents original request for the food stamp child nutrition and women infants and children programs however we have stated clearly in our report that these programs are to be administered at budget resolution assumption levels and that the committee hasample room under our 302 allocation for the supplemental requests needed to fund these programs for the full year it is clearly not the intention of the committee to ignore the budget resolution h r 7072 also funds the international agricultural programs the foreign agriculture service will be receiving 3 million more in 1983 than in 1982 the primary function of this organization is to help american agriculture in maintaining and expanding foreign markets for agricultural products so vital to the economic wellbeing of the nation i and the entire committee remain very concerned about our lack of an effective way to combat the loss of our overseas markets other exporting countries are using every means available to export their surplus eating away at our markets and eroding the earning potential of our own producers one of the reasons our producers were able to take advantage of in creased demand for grain during the 1970s was the fact that we had been operating 6 strong public law 480 concessional sales and food donation program ip addition usda operated a very successful direct loan program for financing export sales these programs were used for market development and gave us the leading edge that allowed the united states to capture most of the world grain and vegetable oil market the committee believes that now is the time to revive a direct credit export program our carryover supplies of wheat feed grain soybeans and dairy products has reached unmanageable levels we can no longer sit back and hope that the export situation will change or that some disaster will increase demand for our products the export credit program funded out of ccc existing authority at 500 million will help get rid of our products by offering terms and conditions more favorable than commercial lenders if used in conjunction with funds provided in the budget reconciliation measure this program could be very effective in raising commodity prices by reducing inventory and could also reduce government price support assistance in summary i urge my colleagues to consider the plight of agriculture

that the concept of 10 billion of private sector money infused into new housing starts at this timein one of the most depressed industries in the countrycould create up to 2 million new jobs and according to a congressional study 2 million new jobs could create a revenue base for the 1983 fiscal year of an additional 50 billion we are talking about an amendment that would cost the taxpayer approximately 100 million to 200 million in additional investment the return would be anywhere from 30 billion to 50 billion we have come to a point in this country with such high unemploymentin my

conformal fuel tanks and advanced sidewinder airtoair missiles for its f15 fighters such sophisticated equipment will greatly increase the firepower and range of the f15s the saudi request if granted could undermine significantly israels ability to defend itself it is undeniable that the saudi rulers continue to see israel as a principal adversary as recently as last month saudi officials called for a holy war against israel three times in the past 30 years saudi armed forces have been employed against israel saudi arabia has led the arab league condemnation of the camp david accords has broken diplomatic relations with and withheld economic support to egypt and has steadfastly refused american proposals to participate in the peace talks moreover it has increased its financial and diplomatic support for the palestine liberation organization in short saudi arabia has played anything but a constructive role in the search for a lasting peace in the middle east ostensibly this sale will contribute to american security interests in the persian gulf by providing the saudi air force with greater deterrent capability against a soviet thrust in the region but 62 f15s sophisticated and formidable as they are would be incapable of blunting a determined soviet attack on saudi oilfields or on the straits of hormuz the more immediate threat to the region stems from soviet forces in afghanistan which pose a direct threat to pakistan and iran not saudi arabia given the instability of the region one cannot discount the possibility that this highly sophisticated unitedstates equipment could fall into the wrong hands thus compromising american military secrets if the sale goes forward in particular the stability of the current saudi regime is not very reassuring the takeover of the grand mosque in the fall of 1979 is only one indication of the vulnerability of the saudi ruling family the principal advantage saudi arabia will gain by the augmentation of its f15 squadrons is directed against israel this is why the proposed sale worries me so greatly and why i believe it is ill advised extending the range of the f15s from 450 miles to 1 000 miles will enable saudi arabia to launch attacks from deep within its territory against any target in israel with more devastating force than the saudis now possess judging frcm past behavior i would not expect the saudis to act alone but in concert with other arab nations in a coordinated attack on a broad front quite obviously precision attacks by heavily armed longrange saudi f15s would severely complicate israeli defense efforts i find it very disturbing that there has been no quid pro quo from saudi arabia in response to unitedstates willingness to bolster its security in fact since the initial sale of f15s received congressional approval in 1978 saudi actions have illustrated belligerence indeed oil blackmail has played and continues to play a prominent role in saudi foreign policy after the 1978 sale for example saudi arabia put considerable pressure on the united states not to build its strategic oil reserve and threatened to cut back production if the warning was disregarded recent statements by saudi oil minister sheik yamani indicate that saudi moderation of oil prices is designated to reduce incentives to search for petroleum substitutes thereby prolonging unitedstates dependence on saudi arabian oil in light of saudi arabias statements and actions one is entitled to the conclusion that it holds no special regard for the united states this is not surprising given the differences in history religion culture and political traditions of the two countries but the united states and israel do have a special relationship tied as we are by religious cultural and political values and traditions let us not forget that israel is the only prowestern demo cratic nation in the middle east its security must be of paramount and overriding importance to unitedstates objectives in the region it is proper to enhance the security of other middle east countries who are opposed to soviet expansion but not to the extent that israels security is thereby complicated if

accounting office report questions the workability of employer sanctions as evidenced by a review of results in the 19 countries where such laws are in force the bill is not fair because it will result in discrimination and its not fair to impose an additional maze of redtape on employers because government agencies have failed to halt the flow of illegal immigrants it also forces an unworkable temporary workers program onto a number of comparitively small farm operations which have specialty shortterm harvests other speakers have expressed the concerns of the hispanic community on behalf of thousands of my constituents i echo these sentiments perhaps the best use of my time and yours in this debate would be to concentrate on the areas in which i have many years of experience i refer to my 25 years as a farmer in central washington state the crops grown there are diversified but include many that are very labor intensive add the dimension of highly perishable products with short weatherdependent harvests and you have a most difficult situation the gamble in this type of farming is reflected in the fact that the average fruit grower in washington state has fewer than 100 acres the risk is so great that major corporations and conglomerates have refused to invest these same growers mostly operating on small family farms ask for no federal support or subsidy they also ask not to be made the enforcer of immigration policy the specialty harvests to which i refer have always depended on temporary shortterm labor since the state of washington is far removed from the normal migrant worker stream agricultural wages in the northwest are the highest or among the highest in the nation for several decades citizens from the great states of oklahoma and arkansas joined local workers in harvesting these crops now many of these former migrants own their own farms in the northwest in recent years hispanic workers have increasingly filled this need for shortterm specialty harvests they have left field work and row crops which have become mechanized and filled the the need created by the growth of the asparagus cherry pear apple grape and hops industries these hispanic workers come from texas and california attracted by piece rates that reward their aggressive work habits there is no argument that since the termination of the bracero program this migrant stream has been joined by an unknown percentage of illegal immigrants by specialty harvests i mean a matter of a few days of work somewhat unpredictable because of weather the professional migrant and aggressive local worker work for a number of employers and have a pattern they have followed for years you dont hear about them because they arrange for their own housing and transportation and they earn very good wages my description of these farm operations brings me to this point employers will have difficulty positively identifying a large crew of workers arriving before daylight in the field an inflexible temporary worker program will leave many crops unharvested meaning thousands of lost jobs for those local citizens working in the packing processing storage and transportation industries prices to consumers will go up and our balance of trades will suffer further erosion the farmers i represent are in financial difficulty now and this legislation could be devastating they have trouble understanding because today under washington state law they cannot legally ask the questions necessary to determine a workers legality and tomorrow under this bill they could be in jail for hiring someone they couldnt identify when i read the current requirements of h2 i have to seriously question whether or not the authors of these regulations have ever visited the pacific northwest to observe how unique the needs of our laborintensive specialty agriculture is workers must be able to move freely over large geographical areas to meet the needs of many growers as the harvest season progresses the h2 program now in place has been bogged down with redtape and subject to uneconomic requirements to the point that it is unworkable for a large shortterm labor need although my preference would be for a temporary guestworker program i have drafted several amendments to improve the legislation to make it acceptable to those farmers who hire workers for the short duration of 20 days or less my amendments are simple the first would mandate that the state employment service be responsible for the legality of the workers it refers a worker would receive some sort of verification from the agency he could bring to the prospective employer to prove that the state service had checked out his legal papers and relieve the farmer of additional paperwork when the worker arrived my second amendment also is designed to alleviate burdensome paperwork from the farmer as i stated earlier there are nearly continuous harvests occurring throughout the pacific northwest and many farmers grow several different corps some of the workers pick cherries for one farmer go to another in the area and pick peaches and return to the original farm in the fall to pick apples i believe that it is totally unnecessary for that farmer to have to redocument the legality of the same worker each and every time he returns for employment my amendment would eliminate the requirements for filling out paperwork under certain restrictive conditions depending on the legal status of that individual there is very little housing available on the west coast that would satisfy the rigid requirements of certified h2 dwellings it would be a prohibitive proposition for individual farmers to construct housing on their property for a short harvest which can be as little as several days in duration farmworkers in the northwest are extremely family oriented many workers now live with other family members and i am proposing an amendment to allow this practice i want to give the employer and the employee the option to substitute payment of a reasonable allowance in lieu of the actual furnishing of housing accommodations and meal preparation facilities i only wish that all members would have the opportunity to witness how easily this could be accomplished and how readily it would be accepted by the farmworkers in some areas of the country i do not view these changes as the answer to the agricultural labor problem but i do see them as a way to improve upon the disastrous impact this bill would have on the economy of the northwest passage of this bill in a form which does not provide for an adequate labor supply will not only cripple the fruit industry but hurt related industries such as the timber industry which supplies the packing cartons the rail and trucking industries and the various ports which handle export cargo in conclusion i join members of congress in agreeing that we need a new immigration policy and commend the judiciary commitlee and its subcommittee members
