nation we are talking about lifting a 40year ban on the export of crude oil risking thousands of jobs and rising gas prices for working families immediately after joining the most important climate agreement ever created we are expected to swallow tiny increases to the programs working families need and rely on while we make permanent tax cuts for corporations and millionaires that we have not paid for we are expected to cheer the extension of vital programs like the child tax credit when that credit has not been indexed to cover the rising costs families face these are games after only a year in congress i am tired of playing them we like the word compromise it implies that we have done something good that we have worked together if we pass this bill we will have worked together to keep america down for generations to come we are patting ourselves on the back for making it out of sequester but the incremental spending increases in this omnibus funding package do nothing to make up for the past 5 years of cuts we have spent so much time digging ourselves deeper and deeper into a funding hole that this omnibus seems like level ground the fact is it is not it is far from it regardless of how nice funding increases may sound the foundations of the american dream are crumbling beneath our feet right now with stagnant wages struggling schools and a wealth gap that is only getting bigger working families need funding that supports their needs they need a tax code that promotes the middle class they need tax credits and funding for programs to help cover the outrageous cost of child care and preschool education costs that outstrip tuition at public colleges in 31 of our 50 states they need funding for higher education that would allow them to graduate without debt they need more support for our highways our bridges our rail systems and broader infrastructure the kinds of projects that create goodpaying jobs and make every community stronger the kinds of projects that cause people to feel confident that they have enough security in their future and enough money in their pocket to spend some of it and help to stimulate the economy and to create many many many ancillary jobs and small business needs they need a lot more than what is being offered in this legislation a funding bill compromise should not compromise the needs of families across the country who are relying on us to get this right any extension of tax credit needs to be protected and uplift every american we cant afford to pass them without a plan for them we have labored over many things in this house we have spent a long time talking about less important issues but we are being confronted right now with a humongous bill that has broad implications on communities that are vulnerable for the next several generations we are asked to support a piece of legislation that does not seem to address from a proportionally equal perspective those needs i want to take a moment now to just draw the houses attention to this front page story in politico it headlines congress halftrilliondollar spending binge what is fascinating about this is that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle the folks that are responsible for this spending binge are always the first to condemn government spending now they want to spend billions of dollars on special interests without supporting pell grants without supporting our historically black colleges and universities without supporting the programs that combat poverty like wic without supporting the working families in this country and supporting the needs that they have in order to prosper their prosperity helps guarantee the economys prosperity because the revenues generated from the things that we do to uplift our working families gets put back into the economy and creates a better fairer and larger economy the numbers in this omnibus lie they sound like increases but they do nothing to pull us out of the rut that the past 5 years have left us in i know that there are many of my colleagues who feel this same way we look at the modest increases that may be associated with the childcare tax credit we look at modest increases that may be applied to a housing program we look at modest increases that may be applied to several programs that if there were sufficient revenue associated with those programs would indeed make a difference in these communities but the proportionality of priority in this omnibus bill and in our effort today and tomorrow does not speak to our acknowledgment that it is the majority of people that it is the middle class the working class and yes even the most vulnerable that we are leaving behind we can do better than that we need to do better than that because we are better than that there are several glaring omissions in the omnibus bill but none are more illogical than our failure to support puerto rico it is unfathomable that we are unwilling to support a unitedstates territory in a financial meltdown just as we offer permanent tax breaks for corporations and special interests who dont even need our help we are leaving the citizens of puerto rico woefully in need this is not fair this is unamerican this is not who we are what is our responsibility to the citizens of puerto rico who wont have access to good hospitals and medical care and medicare what about the children almost 56 percent who live in poverty what are we saying to them what we are saying in this bill that is before us this day coming forth that is expected to move forward in this house is that we are still only concerned with elevating the status the wellbeing the security and the happiness of those who already have a lions share of all of it we are better than that we have a responsibility to speak up protect preserve and ensure opportunity for all that is what we have been elected to do i want to take a moment to talk about the giveaway to oil companies that we have in this omnibus there is nothing positive about this for working families ending the 40year ban on crude oil risks our energy security here at home it threatens our environmental leadership and it takes away jobs from american workers we didnt pass legislation to create more access to oil in this country simply to be able to provide wealthy companies the opportunity to sell it abroad at a higher price to bypass our refineries to sell crude oil in other countries and have them benefit from the jobs that we fought to create through legislation that we passed that is illogical that is counterintuitive to why we did what we did in the first place but yet it is in this bill yet the glaring priority of the wealthy multinational corporations versus the interests of the everyday working families is just in your faceunacceptable totally unacceptable it serves no purpose that i can identify other than to further appease another of the special interest groups so dear to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle but it does nothing for the economy of the united states of america and for the working families here i guess i shouldnt be surprised because it is not the first time and i doubt that it will be the last time we can go on and on and on and i will have additional points that i would like to raise with regard to this omnibus bill but my friend my colleague from the great state of new

have this time to discuss h con res 84 this recognizes the works of the honorable frank m johnson a federal judge not only was he a federal judge he was one of the greatest unsung heroes of the civil rights movement a lawyer par excellence a great student of jurisprudence and i would daresay he was the hidden hand of justice in the civil rights movement before continuing however let me just thank some additional persons it is appropriate that i thank the six original cosponsors of this resolution of course we would mention the honorable alcee hastings of florida and we thank him for signing on to this resolution we also would like to thank the honorable sheila jackson lee of texas the honorable gregory meeks of new york the honorable eleanor holmes norton of washington d c and i especially want to thank the honorable terri sewell of alabama because judge johnson was from alabama she has signed on to this resolution meaning that she has given her approval i am grateful to her she is a great great member of this body and has done quite well in representing the people of her district and indeed her state and her country and finally the honorable frederica wilson of florida all of these members have signed on to this resolution honoring the honorable frank m johnson the honorable frank m johnson was a unique person in american history unique in that he was one of those people that made real the great and noble american ideals liberty and justice for all government of the people by the people for the people he trulyhe trulymade justice more than a word it meant something to him and as a result people were able to benefit from justice justice was more than a word for the honorable frank johnson he did not have it easy however he was appointed to this federal district court by the honorable president dwight eisenhower in november of 1955 after being appointed he immediately had a very difficult case come before him this is when we learned of the character of frank m johnson his character was such that he refused to allow himself to be intimidated over the course of his life he had a cross burned on the lawn of his yard over the course of his life and he lived for 80 years his mothers house was bombed it was thought that it was his home it was bombed by the kkk he was a person who had as a classmate in law school governor george wallace he was a person who probably could not have been predicted to be one of the most significant persons in the civil rights movement at the time he was appointed to the bench there are people who for whatever reasons decide that they are going to do the just and honorable thing and frank m johnson was such a person while he lived he had to have 24hour protection24hour protectionfor his very life because there were those who saw him as a threat to the way of life that existed at that time they wanted to end his life because of his being perceived as a threat to their way of life what is it about him that caused people to want to burn a cross on his lawn that caused persons to bomb his mothers house thinking that it was his what was it about this man that caused people to believe that he was such a huge instrumentality that was moving the south in a direction that they did not want to see it move into well he was one of those persons who actually proved that black lives matter he proved that black lives were as important as any other lives that all lives matter but he proved that black lives matter by his decisions that he made i indicated earlier that one of his first decisions was a difficult one it was a case that involved the bus boycott in montgomery alabama it was a case wherein rosa parks the alabama female of african ancestry took a seat on a bus and after taking that seat she was required to move because as others came on the bus who were white she would have to move as would any other black person and give white persons an opportunity to have seats on the bus she would either have to move back or if all of the other seats were filled she would have to stand she refused as a result of that refusal a civil rights movement was born in montgomery alabama and a protest movement was led by the honorable dr martin luther king as a result of this protest movement many people galvanized they came together and they decided that they would not ride the buses and that they would transport themselves to and from work well one might think that this boycott was the reason that the bus line was eventually integrated after about a year of protestations but the hidden hand of justice was the honorable frank m johnson because he on a threejudge panel concluded that the brown decision which applied to schools should be applied to public accommodations should be applied to public transportation he convinced another judge to do so and as a result they issued an order that desegregated the buses in montgomery alabama he was the hidden hand of justice the protest movement was absolutely necessary but he showed that black lives mattered when he decided that he was going to stand for justice and that he was going to issue that order integrating the bus lines later on in the case of gomillion v lightfoot this is a case that invalidated the city of tuskegees plan to dilute black voting strength at that time it was not unusual for black voting strength to be diluted such that blacks could not get representation we were not represented in congress to the extent that we are today at that time gerrymandering was almost commonplace to make sure that blacks did not have the opportunity to represent constituents in city councils and not only city councils but in county government as state representatives as state senators gerrymandering well it was the honorable frank m johnson that invalidated that plan that they had and ordered the redrawing of the lines in the united states v alabama in 1961 literacy tests were required for blacks but they werent required for whites blacks had to take the test which was impossible to pass in many cases how many bubbles are there in a bar of soap all sorts of ridiculous things were required of blacks but this judge the hidden hand of justice the man who believed that black lives mattered required black people be registered to vote to the same extent as the least qualified white person was registered to vote allowing black people to register allowed more black representation to manifest itself in the years that followed in the case of lewis v greyhound 1961 this case involved the honorable john lewis who is now a member of congress it involved protesting at a bus station it involved being seated at a counter and involved desegregating the bus lines and the bus stations john lewis was one of several persons who were arrested and this violated his civil rights it was the honorable frank m johnson that required the desegregation of the bus depots across the length and breadth of the country by directly doing it in montgomery alabama it eventually became the law across the land again he demonstrated that black lives mattered to him and he moved on it he didnt just believe it he acted on his beliefs in the case of sims v frink in 1962 this had to do with alabama reapportioning alabama had not reapportioned since 1900 the lines had been left as they were because by leaving them as they were they could keep certain people from having a right to vote or having their vote really count in the scheme of one man one vote it was frank m johnson who required that one man one vote principles be utilized giving black people a greater voice in voting in lee v macon county board of education in 1963 this was the first statewide desegregation of schools and it happened in alabama it happened because frank m johnson concluded that black lives mattered he ordered the desegregation of these schools and it was the beginning of something that would spread across this country he was a part of the avantgarde of the civil rights movement but he did so with a pen from the bench as a matter of fact he did not wear a robe when he was on the bench and he did not have a gavel he believed that if you are a just judge and you are going to follow the law you didnt need the robe and you didnt need the gavel you just needed to follow the law and he did so he did so in the case of williams v wallace this is a landmark case in that it involved the honorable dr martin luther king as we know now persons assembled at the edmund pettus bridge they assembled there for the purpose of marching from selma to montgomery when they assembled at the edmund pettus bridge they decided that in marching from selma to montgomery they would assemble themselves at a church and they marched from that church to the bridge if you have not been to the edmund pettus bridge you should do so because as you do so you will see that that bridge has an arch as you move across the bridge you cant see from the start of your movement to the bridge what lies on the other side but on the other side of the edmund pettus bridge were men members of the constabulary they were on horses they had clubs and these men on horses with clubs confronted the marchers who were peaceful they were unarmed they were black they were white they were multiethnic in terms of their ethnicity they were persons of goodwill who only wanted to exercise their freedom of movement to demonstrate to move from one city to another protesting the way african americans were being treated in the south in terms of their voting rights in terms of their inability to receive the same treatment as others under the law well in doing this in marching from selma to montgomery when they encountered these officers with clubs these officers beat them the honorable john lewis was a part of the march he has said on many occasions that he thought he was going to die they beat them all the way back to the church where they startedall the way back to the churchblood on their heads on their bodies on the ground on people as they tried to flee and tried to fend for themselves against these members of the constabulary the marchers returned later to march again but this time they had gone to court and they had appeared before the honorable frank m johnson he issued an order requiring the constabulary to get out of the way and allow the marchers to move from selma to montgomery few people are aware that bloody sunday was followed by an order from the hidden hand of justice the honorable frank m johnson i would daresay that that order and that movement that march were the basis for the passage of the civil rights act of 1965 it passed shortly thereafter the president signed it into law as a result many people who are in congress today are here because that march took place and because the honorable judge the hidden hand of justice frank m johnson signed an order requiring the constabulary to get out of the way what is interesting about this order is that it was issued by his classmate whom i mentioned earlier governor george wallace governor george wallace and frank m johnson were at constant odds with each other they were at odds with each other not only as it related to this march but as it related to the integration of schools as a matter of fact there were many people in alabama who were of goodwill who started to call frank m johnson the real governor of alabama because he stood toe to toe with governor wallace and in so doing made real what the governor had the opportunity to do but refused to do the honorable frank m johnson the hidden hand of justice in alabama and the united states of america in white v cook 1966 he ruled that blacks should be allowed to and must serve on juries in alabama black people have not always had the opportunity to serve even when the law said they had the right to serve as a result of not having the right to serve by virtue of the way people interpreted the law they were denied service on juries it was the honorable frank m johnson that permitted this to happen by his ruling how much time do i have left i would like to make sure that i properly cover

jews killed in the holocaust 1 million tutsis the numbers become abstractions sanitized by their enormity it is only when we consider each of those lives individually that the full horror comes into focus the victims of genocide are more than victimsthey are human beings the armenians massacred from 1915 to 1923 were men women and children who were targeted in what was then an unprecedented campaign to wipe out an entire people it is our duty in the modern day to remember those lost and to bear witness that the campaign to destroy the armenian people failed we do so by speaking the truth and we do so by speaking the names of those 1 5 million and by keeping both the way they lived and the way they died alive in our memory earlier this month i asked my thousands of armenian constituents and millions of armenians around the country and the world to submit the names and stories of their family members who were killed 100 years ago the response was overwhelming thousands of people sent the names and stories of ancestors killed in the genocidethe names of infants and toddlers ripped from their mothers arms the names of children and the elderly dying of exhaustion and starvation on a forced march to deir ezzor the names of women and girls raped and brutalized and killed the names of clergy tortured and burned alive in their own churches the names of men robbed of their possessions of their homes and of their lives each victim has a name and a story from glendale to yerevan to jordan and every corner of the world where armenian diaspora lives families sent me those names and those stories it is my honor to read some of those names this hour knowing that it would take more than 1 000 hours more than 50 days to read all of them turkey may deny the genocide

federal public safety professionals i might add as has already been mentioned the general president of the international association of firefighters which this rule addresses as well has said we urge you to oppose this rule for 20 years our nations trade policy has been failing american workers and the businesses that want to invest in this country it has driven away jobs pushed down wages and exacerbated inequality a vote for fast track is a vote to continue that bad trade policy for another generation because if we approve fast track today we rubberstamp the transpacific partnership agreement the transpacific partnership asks american workers to compete with labor in developing countries like vietnam where the minimum wage is 56 cents an hour it does nothing to combat the biggest source of lost jobscurrency manipulationwhich the economists fred burcksen has said has cost us in the united states up to 5 million jobs people lost their jobs and lost their livelihoods it allows thousands of foreign corporations to challenge unitedstates laws on food safety drug safety environmental protection health care labor rights the minimum wage and indeed any domestic law on any subject the gentleman on the other side of the aisle said that that is not the case just witness what happened last week when the majority in this body voted to repeal country of origin labeling so that we know where our meat our poultry and our pork comes from because the world trade organization and canada and mexico ruled against us so we are going to give up our domestic law this is a trade agreement that has been crafted by lobbyists for the special interests and industries that stand to gain the most by weakening unitedstates regulation and shipping jobs overseas yet the administration has shown absolutely no interest in improving this deal or even listening to our concerns that means that when the transpacific partnership comes to this house we need the ability to amend it at the very least it must include sanctions against currency manipulation enforceable labor environmental standards and include a transparent process if we vote for fast track today we throw away our ability to make any of those amendments and we turn our backs on our commitment to american workers to their jobs to their families and to their economic security we must make this a vote and this vote must

we are going to turn mass incarceration upside down and on its ears and cause it to be extinct this new approach to opioids is part of that this bill has no mandatory minimums as we take the steps today which will allow us to engage in discussions with the senate so that we may soon send a bill to the president for his signature i am pleased of the progress that has been made i can only hope that our work on sentencing reduction prison reform and juvenile justice will have the same kind of impetus and will wind up on the presidents desk that is the vision i believe of many republicans and democrats in and out of this house as well it is the vision of the presidents but more importantly it is the vision of suffering families who do not have their loved ones with them the reason we must work together is that the leading killer of americans today which is drug overdose started first by prescription use in many instances between 2000 and 2014 almost half a million people died from drug overdoses that is a startling number in 2014 alone more than 47 000 people died of drug overdoses the largest percentage of overdose deaths in 2014 was attributed to opioids like prescription painkillers methadone morphine and heroin specifically 28 647 people overdosed and died because of an opioid in 2014 this is an emergency and it is a combination of prescription painkillers and heroin prescription painkillers abuse is the strongest risk for the future use of heroin that is our athletes or those who have had surgeryjust everyday americans who find themselves caught in the trap of addiction approximately three out of four new heroin users report that their use began with the abuse of prescription drugs heroin use becomes appealing to those who are addicted to prescription drugs because it is cheaper and easier to obtain and due to its potency heroin use tends to lead to addiction we know that from the 1980s and 1990s with crack cocaine in that crack was a more potent extraction of cocaine and we saw many of those individuals not get treatment they actually only got incarceration heroin addiction is often deadly just as crack cocaine was in leading to overdose or to other chronic diseases the rate at which the occurrence of heroin overdose deaths has increased is cause for alarm in the 4 years between 2010 and 2014 heroin overdoses more than tripled in 2013 11 million people admitted to the improper use of prescription painkillers and therefore were at a heightened risk of becoming addicted that is why we have worked together this week on legislation to put together something like an omnibus in order to reduce the risks of addiction and to fund appropriate treatment responses for those who abuse these drugs the bill that was passed yesterday reflects the strategy by proposing to establish a grant program to be administered by the department of justice to assist states and local governments it is important to note these statistics the rate of deaths from heroin overdoses that account from the white population saw a 267 percent increase between 2010 and 2014 in african americans there was an increase of 213 percent in 2010 to 2014 in hispanics there was a 137 percent increase from 2010 to 2014 and in native americans there was a 236 percent increase no aspect of american life has been uninfluenced by the devastation of heroin overdoses and deathsmany of it impacting families whose young bright talented athletic and otherwise young people have fallen victim to this this grant program is extremely helpful for which i am very pleased because it deals with monitoring the prescription drugs and it deals with matching those who are committed to working with police officers it is truly an important bill let me close by saying that we must have money to support all of this and i am hoping that this will not be the last stop we will make i rise in support of this amendment to s 524 the comprehensive addiction and recovery act this

the department of justice to assist states and local governments particularly by helping criminal justice agencies to tackle the opioid problem from a variety of angles this bill included in this amendment encourages the development of alternatives to incarceration that provide treatment as a solution to the underlying motivation for criminal behavior or conduct associated with mental disorders we must make our best efforts to prevent individuals from moving from painkillers to heroin by making treatment for addicts more accessible by encouraging the use of evidencebased programs such as medicationassisted treatment lifesaving overdose reversal drugs like naloxone are most valuable in the hands of trained individuals who regularly come in contact with individuals who are prone to drug overdoses this legislation will increase the use and availability of naloxone and other overdose reversal drugs to first responders addiction is a disease that affects the brain and eventually changes the behavior of addicts causing them to experience mental health issues and encounter legal problems treatment is the most reasonable and effective approach to diverting these individuals away from homelessness and prison there are also specific provisions we have proposed that allow for a wide range of services to be offered to our veterans who tend to suffer from mental health issues and addiction i support this legislation because i believe that it will help save lives and prevent and treat opioid addiction the approach congress is taking with the crisis of heroin and other opioids is thoughtful and comprehensive i hope it signals a departure from some of the failed approaches concerning other drug crises in the past for instance our response to the surge in crack cocaine in the 1980s was to enact draconian mandatory minimum penalties with vastly disparate treatment for crack and powder cocaine at that time we in congress took action that we are still trying to rectify at one point more than 80 of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were african american despite the fact that more than 66 of crack users are white or hispanic as we work on other legislation to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack issue we must reexamine our approach to that and other drug issues while law enforcement has an appropriate role and the bills recognize that the bills we adopted this week and that we put forth as an amendment to the senate bill today reflect a broader strategy that reflects the fact that this is an addiction issue accordingly we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums but we are funding antiaddiction mechanisms such as treatment alternatives to incarceration we are not adding to mass incarcerationwith all of the related and devastating collateral consequencesbut instead we are incentivizing state and local governments to prevent treat and heal that is what we should be doing and that is what we should have done for crack and cocaine addicts with that history in mind and with the chance to take smarter and more effective steps now i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the houseand in the senateto apply this more comprehensive approach including treatment alternatives to those suffering from crack and cocaine addiction yesterday in my closing remarks on h r 5046 i stated my intention to ensure that we make progress on addiction not only involving opioids but drugs like crack and powder cocaine as well as i express my support for this legislation i

amendment does in striking the section is allow the epa to consider future changes to the fill definitions clearly the work begun in the clinton administration and finalized in the george w bush administration were the best possible actions at the time in the meantime we have discovered that unfortunately much mining waste and refuse are ending up in mining streams and rivers and it has severely affected the health of those people we are not attempting to eliminate mining jobs or to even impact earth moving it is only reasonable to make sure that our environmental protection agency

yield myself such time as i may consume i rise today in strong support of my legislation h r 5056 the airport perimeter and access control security act i want to thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for his hard work in the committee on homeland security where we are colleagues as well as his work trying to keep our nations security and our airport security at its highest level this bill was a long time coming since i was first elected to congress in 2010 i have worked hard to secure our nations airports the last case i had when i was a district attorney before entering congress was the case of a young 16yearold who had secreted himself on a commercial airliner penetrating the perimeter of the charlottedouglas international airport and undetected stowed himself away in the wheel well tragically he went from north carolina and his body was found in massachusetts in the district i represented as we investigated the cause of that death we found out what the circumstances were that he had penetrated all the security in fact i sent my investigators down from massachusetts to look at that even knowing that this had occurred there was no record videowise or otherwise of what he had done so even looking backwards we couldnt even find out where the security was breached until we made the conclusions at the end of our investigation and looked at the perimeter of that airport and how vulnerable that was since that time i have demanded information on areas of perimeter and access security in our airports frankly not satisfied with the progress in addressing these security issues i requested an independent review in 2014 of all airports with a transportation security administration presence released this spring this independent report by the gao found that while tsa has made some progress in assessing risks to airport perimeter and access control security the agency had not taken new or emerging threats into consideration as well as the unique makeup of individual airports the points of access at those individual airports and the unique perimeters surrounding those airports updating the risk to our airports with information that reflects the current threat ensures that the tsa bases its risk management decisions on current information and focuses its limited resources on the highest priority risks to each airport further gao found that tsa has not comprehensively assessed the vulnerability of commercial airports systemwide in fact from 2009 to 2015 tsa conducted these comprehensive assessments at only 81 of the 437 commercial airports nationwide or 19 percent and that is cumulatively some years that assessment only occurred in 3 percent of the airports this legislation will make permanent the recommendations from this independent report specifically the bill requires tsa to update transportation security sector risk assessments for the entire aviation sector it requires it to update the comprehensive risk assessment perimeter access control with the most currently available intelligence it requires that it conduct a thorough assessment of airport perimeters and access control points such as the unique geography each individual airport entails and it determines a future strategy of regular updates further the bill incorporates the input of major airport operators which we met with here in d c with the committee on homeland security we heard firsthand their concern of the lack of an individualized security strategy a recent report of the associated press investigation found that intruders breach airport fences approximately every 10 days altogether there were at least 39 breaches nationwide in 2015 which was also the annual average from 2012 to 2015 tsas own calculation over a 10year period ending in 2011 showed 1 300 perimeter breaches in the 450 domestic airports but that figure does not account for continued perimeter security breaches since 2011 including stowaways trespassing across tarmacs scaling of perimeter fences and driving vehicles through barriers across airport property the landscape in which terrorists operate is constantly changing and it is challenging we have to stay ahead of it we have to look no further than the recent attacks in paris brussels and istanbul to see what the threats are within access points and perimeters of airports we were lucky here in the unitedstates that the individuals that breach these access points and perimeters did not have the same nefarious intentions but that doesnt mitigate the risk it doesnt mitigate the fact that these people pose dangerous behavior potentially to our airports to our employees and of course the passengers and travelers who rely on tsa officers and airport operators for their security i urge my colleagues to support h r i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.04154026508331299, 0.541540265083313, 1, "i thank the gentleman for the time i rise today to discuss a subject many of our veterans and their families understandably find great difficulty in discussing veteran suicide as we have already heard is a major problem in our country we have all heard the numbers an estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every day that is one life every hour please keep in mind those horrific numbers have names the names of men and women who put themselves in harms way in order to keep each and every one of us safe earlier this year we passed the clay hunt suicide prevention of american veterans act it addresses the need for more mental healthcare experts inside the va along with expanding the time available to veterans to seek mental health care through the va the new law also calls for an evaluation of all va mental health care and suicide prevention practices to determine what is working and make recommendations on what is not this is a major step in the right direction but we must continue to do more i am proud to say that in omaha we are currently working with the department of veterans affairs to create a center of excellence a national model for veterans care that will include topflight mental health care and other services so much needed by our veterans in our community that treatment would cover posttraumatic stress disorder depression anxiety and problems relating to other people the debt we owe the men and women who serve this country is a debt that can never be repaid but we must continue to ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans and support their very unique healthcare issues"]]}
