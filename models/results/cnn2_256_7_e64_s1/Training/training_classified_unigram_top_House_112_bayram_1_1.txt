it is reported by the rules committee this would allow for the sameday consideration of any resolution reported through the legislative day of august 2 2011 this rule will ensure that congress has the necessary tools to pass a bill that ensures we cut spending without defaulting on our national debt today you will hear my friends the democrats argue about a closed process but you will not hear them discuss the unprecedented spending spree that my friends the democrats on the other side of the aisle went through for the last two congresses we will discuss how republicans continue to come up with thoughtful solutionsand i add balanced thoughtful solutionsto our nations economic troubles what we think will and what has up to now only failed in the senate we will talk about the magnitude of this vote and the importance of reaching an agreement before tuesday it is time to stop pontificating and start acting like members of congress the nation calls for a solution and republicans are the only ones to offer solutions in legislation in debate on the floor and with actual votes my friends on the other side of the aisle will go on and on today about how republicans are closing the process and shutting out members of congress when were really here providing for the flexibility for the speaker of the house to simply work with the senate to ensure a solution to the looming debt crisis deadline is met so that we will not default on our obligations if my democrat colleagues were serious about finding solutions to this problem they would vote in favor of this rule today the facts of the case are clear the chairman of the rules committee the gentleman from california david dreier has issued more open rules in the last month than congress has seen over the last two congressesor for a total of 4 years combined additionally in the 111th congress under the leadership of nancy pelosi and the chairman of the rules committee at the time louise slaughter 26 sameday rules were reported out of the rules committee and in the previous congress the 110th congress under the same leadership 17 sameday rules were reported out by the rules committee in comparison the process regarding these rules in this congress is a far cry from the previous democrat leaderships unorthodox and unprecedented closed processes i rise today in support of this rule this rule is essential to allow the house of representatives the flexibility it needs to ensure the safety and soundness of our countrys economic future over the past 4 years weve seen record debt and deficits which have brought us to the crossroad that we face with the looming august 2 deadline for raising the debt ceiling americans continue to speak out loudly and clear and just as they did last november they are saying it is time to stop the outofcontrol spending wasteful washington spending and excessive government republicans have cut spending at every opportunity in this congress and we are hoping to do that again today discretionary and mandatory spending at federal levels are on unsustainable paths in the last 2 years of democrat control congress has approved and the president has signed into law an 84 percent increase in nondefense discretionary spending and the presidents budget proposes to freeze discretionary spending at these inflated levels america can no longer support or afford this kind of leadership the presidents proposed fy 2012 budget also doubles then triples the federal deficit over the next 10 years and while increasing taxes on the nations job creators by 1 6 trillion sounds like a good deal to the president in fact free enterprise system employers and american workers know otherwise additionally the presidents budget makes no substantial effort to address the unsustainable rate of entitlement spending one of the major aims of the presidents own fiscal commission which he has ignored obviously the president has no intention of cutting spending or reining in big government programs big government more taxes more regulations are directly in the presidents strike zone and that is the process he intends to challenge congress to come right along with him on and keep marching toward the cliff were at the end of the road once again today republicans are saying we are going to have to make tough choices thats why we came to congress and the majority party will continue to do that today over the past 7 months republican leadership has been steadfast in their support for cutting spending and getting control of our record deficit and debt the house passed h r 1 a continuing resolution that brought back spending levels to 2008 levels cutting 100 billion in 1 year in april this house passed a budget that would cut 6 2 trillion in government spending over the next decade compared to the presidents budget just last week this body passed cut cap and balance which would limit discretionary spending cap spending to a lower percentage of gdp and lead to a balanced budget act so congress could no longer write checks that they cant cash without passing the debt on by asking foreign governments and others to make up the difference for us republicans are willing to pay the balance if the president is willing to cut up the credit card and that is why we are here also today republicans have again and again in the house offered commonsense solutions to rein in spending and cut down our debt my friends on the other side of the aisle continue to reject every single proposal so one might ask what is their solution what have they have offered this nation to spur economic growth and to put americans back to work we would ask so let me tell you by raising taxes by raising taxes on individuals on small businesses and corporations alike this is no wonder why we see stagnant job growth gdp that lags behind and high employment ratesand that means we cannot meet the needs of this country even when the increase in taxes hurts our economic recovery slows job growth and places more uncertainty in the marketplace our friends the democrats continue to argue for more spending and more taxation president obama has asked congress for an increase in the debt ceiling and my republican colleagues and i refuse to grant that request without a commitment to longterm spending cuts we reject president obamas insistence for a blank check to pay the credit card bills that he has run up over the past 212 years president obamas unwillingness to address the true drivers of our debt assured me and my party that we cannot achieve a true solution to the debt crisis we are facing today unless were able to make tough decisions the budget control act we discussed yesterday and what we will discuss today is a step in the right direction it accomplishes what republicans and the american people have been asking for since the beginning of this process it will reduce spending more than we increase the debt limit it imposes no new taxes on anyone and it guarantees to americans that the house and the senate will vote in the next 6 months on the only permanent solution to our debt crisis yes the republicans are here on the floor again working on behalf not only of employers and employees but the middle class of this country those of us who are concerned about where we are headed there is nothing in this resolution that should cause

the halls of congress this organization was originally founded by president franklin delano roosevelt to help treat and prevent polio the march of dimes would meet with tremendous success and through their funding of the work of dr jonas salk would contribute greatly to curing that disease having accomplished their original goal the march of dimes would turn their attention to promoting healthy women healthy pregnancies and healthy babies the march of dimes foundation works not only here in the united states in local communities around the country but as i mentioned also around the world to educate and inform women doctors and policymakers on the prevention of birth defects and premature birth this work is so vital so very important and really so very precious and a healthy pregnancy and a healthy birth can mean so much and start the child off on the right foot that will last the rest of their entire life this bill is simple it would allow for the minting the making of a commemorative coin which basically will be a silver 1 coin for this wonderful organization these coins would then be sold to the general public with a portion going to pay off the cost of minting the coin but the rest going to support the very very important work of this foundation so i ask that my colleagues join me in voting in favor of this bill and in so doing well be sending a big thankyou to the march of

in that case the supreme court rendered a decision that may be spun by many perceived by many as a victory for the proponents of the controversial individual mandate contained within the affordable care act i would submit today however that this victory if it is being called that will prove to be not only hollow but also short lived i say that because significantly the supreme court was able to uphold the constitutionality of the mandate only by a series of gymnastics that allowed the court to find this was a tax first the court addressed the issue and concluded for only the third time in the last 75 yearsonly the third time since 1937that congress had in fact exceeded its power as asserted under the commerce clause of the unitedstates constitution having concluded that congress lacks the authority to compel commerce the creation of commerce so that it could then regulate commerce the supreme court went on to shoehorn this individual mandate provision into the supreme courts conception of congresss taxing power this awkward construction is one that exposes many of the true flaws of the individual mandate the mandate itself we must remember was not wildly popular among the american people at the time it was enacted it has become even less popular as the american people have come to understand it a recent poll revealed that roughly 74 percent of americans do not like the individual mandate this is easy for us to understand when we think about the fact that we as americanswe are born as a free people we were intended to live as a free people it offends our most basic sense of freedom to have one of the most personal decisions made for us by governmentparticularly by the impersonal distant government that is based in washington dc these kinds of decisions should be made by the individuals and families in consultation with their doctors not by government bureaucrats in washington dc so the fact that it is unpopular does not surprise us and given the fact that the supreme court was able to uphold the individual mandate only by calling it a tax is very significant it is especially significant given the fact that it was pitched to the american people as something other than a tax the president promised us he would not raise our taxes he promised us the individual mandate did not amount to a tax increase he promised us all along that he would never raise the taxes of any american earning less than 250 000 a year well those who participated in congress who voted for this provision also promised us this would not amount to a tax increase they did so for one simple reason they knew it could not pass they knew it would not be able to get the number of votes necessary to make it become law if they called it a tax so they did not they went to great lengths to make sure it was not described or characterized or structured as a tax within the text of the statute itself now after the fact the supreme court has taken the step of shoehorning this regulation into congresss taxing authority and it is calling it a tax effectively insulating those members of congress who voted for it from the political liability attached to having voted for a tax increasenot just any tax increase but a tax increase that the joint committee on taxation has concluded will be borne overwhelmingly by hardworking middleincome earners in fact they have concluded that over 75 percent of the burden associated with this mandate that has now been deemed a tax will be paid by those earning less than 250 000 a year it was unpopular before we were told it would be deemed a tax now that it is a tax we cannot expect that its status as a tax will enhance its popularity if anything we can expect that it will become even less popular with the american people for that reason i am absolutely convinced that for those who call this a victory for the individual mandate it will prove to be anything but a victory it will prove to be something that will result in a groundswell of people contacting their members of congress telling them they do not want their taxes raised telling them that members of congress who voted for this promised them it would not be a tax increase asking them for instance to vote on it to decide once and for all whether they are willing now to call it a tax given that was the only way in which it could be affirmed upheld as a valid constitutional exercise of congresss power as we move forward to the november elections we are going to hear a lot about what people do not want out of their national government we will continue to hear a lot from those people who are offended by this notion that the government can tell them where to go to the doctor and how to pay for it who are offended by the notion that government would step in and tell americans you have to buy health insurance not just any health insurance but that health insurance which congress in its infinite wisdom has deemed necessary for every american to purchase and if you do not you are going to be penalized if you do not you are going to be taxed people are going to be upset about this they are going to complain to congress and to candidates for congress they are going to complain to the president and to other candidates for the presidency that this is not the kind of government they want after they do that they will proceed and they will start talking about what kind of government they do want that is where we have to move away from the kind of government we do not want toward the kind of government we do want the kind of government we do want today is in so many respects the same kind of government we as americans have always wanted ever since our founding that is a government that at the national level recognizes limits to its power recognizes that whenever government acts it does so at the expense of our individual liberty when the federal government acts to a significant degree it does so at the expense of our state governments governments which are closer to the people and often more responsive to the needs and to the evolving demands of the people this is not simply a technicality upon which we are involved in a discussion this is a very important part of the political process it is essential that any time we raise taxes we do so in a way that is clear to the people and that we stand accountable to the people for raising taxes the courts do not have the expertise to do that and yet they exercised that power today as the majority opinion today reminded the supreme court of the united states possesses neither the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments those decisions are entrusted to our nations elected leaders who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them this reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from our countrys greatest founding father george washington who said something very similar way back in 1789 when he explained the power under the constitution will always be in the people it is entrusted for certain defined purposes and for a limited period to the representatives of their own choosing and whenever it is executed contrary to their interests or not agreeable to their wishes their servants can and undoubtedly will be recalled this reminds us of the fact that we as americans are in control of our own destiny as a nation we as americans are here and have the prerogative to explain what we want and what we do not want out of our government the government exists to serve the people and not the other way around the decision rendered by the supreme court today while i disagree with it in many respects is one that i predict will usher in a new era of robust debate and discussion over issues of federalism and individual freedom that debate i am convinced will lead inexorably to the result that we as americans will become more free less captive to a government that tells us where to go to the doctor and how to pay for it and that we as a

solve all the problems but it certainly will solve a lot of them one of the things that mr devaney said who was over the stimulus bill and the rat board there is that he wanted to do certain things that not only would lay out a formula for accountability but would prevent people from even abusing the system again i think what were doing here puts us out front of hopefully some things that people may have been thinking about doing we dont even want to think about it because there are so many people in our districts who work so hard to earn their money and they dont mind paying their taxes they dont mind sacrificing as long as they know that that money is being spent effectively and efficiently one of the things that we have to do is to make sure that we establish and maintain a trust with them so that when they write that check they know its going towards the roads that they want to see built going towards making sure the air is clean and making sure that the park rangers are present

budget is actually decreased by a slightly higher amount than the overall ag budget rather than a slightly lower amount in addition to that i do wish to address a number of charges laid before the chairman of the ag appropriation committee weve heard for hours that this bill is about supporting wall street big oil and tax breaks at the expense of food security i think its very important to note that food security is an important american value its important to me its important to many of us so much so that in a time of very tight budgets this bill actually raises food and nutrition spending by nearly 7 billion approximately 7 percent more than current levels because there are many vulnerable americans out there who now qualify during these very tight economic times secondly i also wish to reiterate i did not support the wall street bailouts many of us didnt both democrat and republicans five banks now control more than 50 percent of the deposited assets in this country main street banks many of whom had no role in the reckless behavior on wall street are now under the constant competitive pressure from those banks that were deemed too big to fail but in actuality are too big to succeed id also like to point out that i did not vote for the tax deal passed at the end of last year an 11thhour deal that was cobbled together because of the mismanagement of this institutional

turning to the federal government for relief from high gas prices however approval of the keystone xl pipeline will lead to exactly the opposite result it will actually raise gas pricesprincipally in the midwest in fact some of the states that will suffer the worst gas price increases are the same ones that will have to bear the environmental burden of this pipeline this is not just my conclusion this is the conclusion of transcanada the company that wants to build the keystone xl pipeline this is the conclusion of international energy consultant purvin and gertz inc the company that transcanada hired to evaluate its keystone xl pipeline and this is the conclusion of respected oil market economist philip verleger that is why transcanada wants to build this pipeline my amendment simply requires the secretary of energy to analyze the effect of the proposed pipeline on increased gas prices for american consumers and to determine if this pipeline is just an effort to manipulate the market for crude oil in the united states the proposed pipeline would carry up to 900 000 barrels per day of tar sands oil from alberta canada over 2 000 miles to refineries on the unitedstates gulf coast proponents have claimed that it would bring down oil prices however transcanadas permit application to the canadian government for the pipeline included documents and testimony which said canadian oil companies could use the pipeline to increase americas fuel bill by up to 4 billion per year by limiting the supply of canadian crude to midwest refineries and rerouting it to gulf coast refineries this benefit to canadian oil companies was used by transcanada to argue that approval of the pipeline was in canadas interest but this information was conveniently hidden when transcanada applied for the unitedstates presidential permit from the state department this information comes from a report by international energy consultant purvin and gertz inc the company that transcanada hired to evaluate its keystone xl pipeline in section 3 4 3 of their report they concluded that there was an oversupply of crude oil in the midwest that resulted in lower prices for canadian crude oil and that the keystone xl pipeline would remove this oversupply and raise crude oil prices in the market in section 3 4 5 of their report they recite that keystone has reviewed the pgi assessment and agrees with its conclusions through manipulation of unitedstates oil markets the keystone xl pipeline will increase unitedstates gas prices by 10 to 20 cents per gallon across the united states according to respected oil market economist phillip verleger however the greatest price increasetwice as much by one estimatewill occur in 15 states including my state of ohio illinois indiana iowa kansas kentucky michigan minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota oklahoma south dakota tennessee and wisconsin it is estimated to increase prices by 6 55 per barrel of crude oil in the midwest and 3 per barrel across the unitedstates this market manipulation will gouge american consumers forcing them to hand over up to 3 9 billion hardearned american dollars to foreign oil companies every year while this boon may benefit transcanada and canadian oil shareholders it will only further devastate the american people our economy and farmers who are already struggling financially and cant afford a gas price hike americans want low gas prices permitting the keystone xl pipeline will deliver the opposite by increasing prices at the pump and making americans pay more and more for almost every

to future generations to be good stewards of the public lands the vital natural resources and the wildlife that we have within our borders but dont take my word for it we have had a tradition in this place for many years of having strong bipartisan support for reasonable sensible land and water conservation programs thats why earlier this month a coalition of over 640 outdoor recreation entities sent a letter to each of our offices including the congressional leadership expressing their deep concern and dismay over the funding cuts proposed in this appropriation bill this letter was signed by entities such as the boone and crockett club congressional sportsmens foundation ducks unlimited national fish and wildlife foundation national wild turkey foundation theodore roosevelt conservation partnership and trout unlimited and it was also signed by the president of the wilderness society bill meadows and a board member of the civil war trust john nau i would like to read that letter at

conservation outdoor recreation and historic preservation and investments in them are vital to the future of our great nation like you we are concerned about our nations fiscal health the nation faces unsustainable future fiscal deficits which must be addressed as part of the overall solution to our deficit challenges we know that conservation recreation and historic preservation programs will not and should not be exempted from scrutiny we are willing to engage in a process to find further savings in spending and review the economic and budgetary benefits of critical conservation outdoor recreation and historic preservation programs the federal budget cannot and should not be balanced disproportionately on the backs of conservation outdoor recreation and preservation doing so will impose on the future generations whose wellbeing depends on the conservation and preservation of our common natural and historic resources as a diverse community of taxpayers and voters who care about natural resource conservation outdoor recreation and historic preservation we stand ready to work with you on serious efforts to address our nations economic and fiscal challenges as they relate to investments in and tough choices about the programs we care about we urge this congress to address the federal deficit while still investing in critical conservation recreation and historic preservation programs in 2012 these groups realize as many of us realize too this is more than just being good stewards of the land and doing right by future generations investment in these vital programs is crucial for economic development and job creation in this country the outdoor industry foundation has issued a survey from year to year showing the economic impact of many of these conservation programs on outdoor recreation activities they found that outdoor recreation contributes 730 billion annually to the unitedstates economy supports 61 2 million private sector jobs one out of every 20 jobs and stimulates 8 percent of consumer spending in wisconsin my home state hunting and fishing alone supports 57 000 jobs and 400 million in state revenue sportsmen spend 3 1 billion annually which helps stimulate the wisconsin economy and other states the irony in all this is that these organizations and these programs have been giving at the idol of deficit reduction for some time in fact over the last 30 years american investment in parks wildlife clean water and clean air has fallen from 1 7 percent of overall federal budget to less than 0 6 percent so throughout the years there has been a continual reduction in funding for these programs the irony is that for many of these programs for every public dollar used it is leveraged to draw in more private sector dollars this too will be in great jeopardy with the dismantling of these programs these arent programs you can just turn on and off with a spigot you need a continuity of care to keep them going with funding reductions of this magnitude it will be difficult if not impossible to maintain that continuity of care whether it is to clean water clean air to wildlife preservation and enhancement all of

gentlemans comments and his voting record we heard a great argument about the need to cut the budget deficit and stop spending during the recent debate on the budget an amendment was offered to limit entitlement spending to farmers to 250 000 per entity the amendment said no agricultural entity no individual could get more than 250 000 per year it was defeated by the republican party the majority of democrats voted for it it will cost 1 billion over 10 yearsat least we had the brazilian cotton farmers but my friends on the other side hate for me to mention that because unpleasant reality is always bothersome you know over a 4year period were going to spend more money subsidizing american and brazilian cotton farmers than we are on this program the gentleman from alabama said yesterday that it was obama who made him do it rather implausibly he argued that he was compelled to follow this recommendation of the obama administration to send 150 million a year to brazilian cotton farmers for 4 years because the president told him to do it well thats a very selective invocation of the president i must sayno more persuasive than flip wilson having invoked the devil as having made him do it and of course there are sometimes analogies in the way in which they refer to the president one hundred fifty million dollars now the argument by the way was that we have to send 150 million to brazilian cotton farmers the gentleman voted for it because otherwise we would be in trouble with the world trade organization but we could have saved that 150 million to the brazilians by not sending 150 million to the american cotton farmers by the way that would include american cotton farmers who could get more than 250 000 a year so were not debating whether or not we should reduce the deficit it is how do you exempt agriculture as many of my friends do because they represent agricultural districts as for conservatism and the free market it has got no application to the growth of cotton or grain or of many of these other programs that receive so much money beyond that we have the military now were talking here about trying to stop a serious economic problem in american cities well we cant afford that but 400 million was voted to be spent on infrastructure in afghanistan i do not think that that 400 million will be very well spent i understand there are some national security needs but i think that that war has gone on too long and the notion of sending 400 million to build up the cities in afghanistan and to deny helping america makes no sense we are also being told that we can send 1 2 billion for iraqi security forces over and above what we spend on the american military we are sending 1 2 billion i voted against that members on the other side voted for it the whole war in iraq has been an enormous waste in my judgment of american money at the cost of american lives brave young americans went to war when they were asked to by their country but it was a mistake for them to be sent there the war in iraq has so dwarfed any domestic expenditures in this area that i do not understand how members can on the one hand talk seriously about cutting the deficit and then have voted for more and more and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars for that war in iraq now we have another point that should be made it is true this 1 billion that we are asking forand by the way according to the cbo it will cost 840 million not 98 percent in total expenditure but 84 percent its still a high number but 140 million is still 140 million so this will cost 840 million according to the cbo if it is fully run it is going to come out of the treasury right now but lets be clear the reason it will come out of the treasury as we try to deal with thisby the way here is what the program is it says to americans who took out mortgages and became unemployed that we will help them pay their mortgages because you cant afford mortgage payments out of unemployment compensation thats the lavishness of this program were taking people who are in trouble and facing losing their homes and having more foreclosures which have negative effects not just on the individual foreclosed but on the neighborhood on the city on the whole economy so this has a macroeconomic impact but we are going to come to their assistance in the financial reform bill passed last summer we in the conference committee voted to take this money from an assessment on the largest financial institutions we voted that financial institutions with 50 billion or more in assets and hedge funds with 10 billion or more in assets would have to pay for this and our logic was that it was the activity of these institutions that caused the crisis that led to the unemployment and led to the foreclosures many of them profited from it and we then had the tarpand this is money that we voted in the tarp in another set of programsand we said you benefited from intervention we didnt do it because we loved you we did it because we had to save the economy from going upside down i know members like to rail about bailouts but lets be very clear every activity in the united statesknown as a bailout recentlywas at the initiative of the george bush administration or mr paulsen and mr bernanke and they were bipartisanly supported and i agree that we had to do them we had to do them because of failures in past regulatory policy but the fact is that in the bill we passed last summer this money wouldnt have come from the treasury it wouldnt have added to the deficit it would have been recouped from an assessment on large financial institutions the republican party blocked itnot here they didnt have the votes here as we dont often have the votes today but in the senate so i will make this announcement i plan to reintroduce next week the provision of the financial reform bill that would have taken the money for this program and other programs to alleviate the impact of foreclosurethe neighborhood stabilization program that helps get foreclosed property back into productive use aid to the homeowners who are unemployedand pay for it as we tried to do last july but republican opposition stopped us not from the taxpayer but from the large institutions and i dont mean to demonize but i think goldman sachs and wells fargo and the bank of america and citicorp and morgan stanley and the large hedge funds i think they can pay for this thats what we would have done so i agree this should not come from the taxpayer by the way with regard to the bill we debated yesterdayand i regret not pointing this out but you know you can only correct so much error in a limited amount of time i talk fast but error outpaces me when we get into these debates we were talking yesterday about money that was going to be spent in another program the fha refi and people talked about 8 billion yes 8 billionit wont cost 8 billionbut 8 billion that was set aside if necessary from the tarp and people said that tarp money was promised to go back to the taxpayers it was and heres howmembers may have forgotten this having voted for it but in the tarp legislation we added a provision that said in 2013 when the tarp is concluded the president at that time is mandated to send to the congress a bill that would recoup the funds that had not been returned to the treasury from those large financial institutions and we reiterated that in the financial reform bill over the republicans objections so the point is this the tarp money that will be spentif it is on the refinancingand the tarp money that will be spent on the hamp program will not come out of the treasury it will be reimbursed to the treasuryif my colleagues on the other side go along with what we voted forfrom the large financial institutions so lets be very clear whether we are talking about the programs in the financial reform bill or the programs in the tarp they are a package of programs to deal with the consequences of foreclosure i must say i saw a draft of my republican colleagues budget views and they saidastonishinglythat spending tarp money to deal with foreclosures was inappropriate because those were unrelated to the financial crisis foreclosures unrelated to the financial crisis that is an illogic that i am surprised at ideology drives you to certain ridiculous conclusions but that one goes further into that than i would have thought so lets again be very clear our proposals are that the large financial institutionsassets of 50 billion or more hedge funds of 10 billion or more most of which would direct beneficiaries of our activity in dealing with the financial crisis that many of them helped causethats how we will fund these programs so with regard to the hamp with regard to the fha refinance no that will not come out of the treasury that will be reimbursed ultimately yes the tarp money goes back and the law calls for that to be assessed and so yes i understand my republican colleagues they dont want goldman sachs or citicorp or any of the large financial institutions or any of the large hedge funds to have to pay the cost but thats what the debate is not the treasury and the average taxpayer versus alleviation of foreclosure the large financial institutions and yes they did succeed temporarily i hope in changing that they knocked out of our bill a requirement that the large financial institutions would help us mitigate foreclosures and help us have cities buy up property that is rotting and causing trouble and unfortunately temporarily thats not the case but i will file the bill next week and given their concern for the taxpayer and the deficit they will have a choice do you add the cost of these programs to the deficit because theyre not going to become law these repealers the president is going to veto them the senate wont pass them even for him to do that are you then going to say that it will come out of the deficit or will you join us in taking it from goldman sachs and morgan stanley and the bank of america and those unreasonable institutions that do a lot of good work but they can afford this 1 billion their bonuses alone would pay for these programs so lets be clear what the choice is first of all we have people who are prepared to send money to brazilian cotton farmers so they can send money to american cotton farmers they will not limit entitlements to agricultural individuals to 250 000 a year theyll send billions to afghanistan and iraq that will be wasted not for our defense but to build up their infrastructure and their security and then when it does come to the relatively small amount that we will be spending on some of these programs like 840 million hereand thats small compared to what they spend elsewhere for instance in their warsthey would rather have it come out of the taxpayer they would rather not spend it at all but if they have a second choice it comes out of the taxpayer and not out of the large financial institutions so lets frame the debate appropriately the large financial institutions because of inappropriate regulation and improper regulation during the bush yearsfairly the clinton years as well but mostly the bush yearsprovoked a financial crisis we began to deal with it in 2008 in the last months of the bush administration in a bipartisan way we did it we provided some funding in the first instance to those very financial institutions not out of love for them but because we thought that was needed to stabilize the requirement is that any money spent under the tarp will ultimately be recouped by an assessment on the large financial institutions apparently the republicans want to forget that one they want to act as if its the treasury apparently because they cant bear the thought of telling the large financial institutions who were a large part of the cause of the financial crisis and benefited from our efforts to correct it that they should have to pay and we do know that when we said this program and programs to give money to municipalitieswhich they very much wantto buy up property that would otherwise fester because there would be nobody to make them take care of it that they prefer that to be paid for by the taxpayer than by the large financial institutions well give them a chance to correct that mistake so i hope this bill is defeated and next week we will have legislation that i hope our committee will be having hearings on and act on which will reinstate the provision that says all of the four programs were dealing with this week and next week will be dealt with in one of two ways it will be financed by the tarp and that money will be recovered when the program is over by an assessment on the large financial institutions and the smaller amounts that will go to this program that money will also be recouped from the large financial institutions and those institutions which received hundreds of billionsthey have repaid it and it has been usefulbut they were great beneficiaries of it they caused some of the problem in general they will be the ones that will bear the cost so thats the choice we have a choice of doing nothing to alleviate the impact of foreclosures on the overall economy on municipalities and on families or of doing something and recouping that money from the large

make sure that if people see something that is a threat to them or the service or to our national interests at all they should feel free reporting it the problem i have with this amendment is current law protects that we have current statute with whistleblower protection that very clearly says that if you have any reason to believe that something is going on that is counterproductive or detrimental to the united states interests or security you are free to report that to the appropriate superiors that law is there and is protected now i will agree with the sponsor that people nonetheless are reluctant to come forward and provide that information but what we need to do is we need to educate people about that protection being there in the current law what this amendment does is broadens that to the point where its going to sweep a lot of stuff up that we dont want to hear about it isnt necessarily going to make it any more likely that what we want to hear about is going to be reported by saying ideologically based threats or actions that is beyond broad it almost is beyond definition it is the freedom to say anything about anyone any time with this protection which i dont think we want which i think would undermine the broader mission so the current law makes it clear if you are a servicemember who sees a threat or perceives a threat for any reason ideologically based or otherwise frankly i dont see why it makes any difference whether or not its ideologically based we want it reported so that is current law its protected we need to make sure that everyone not just servicemembers but everyone in society feels free to report such threats to the appropriate authorities this amendment is overly broad and would cause more trouble than it would solve so therefore i oppose the amendment and urge the body to do so i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.007882416248321533, 0.49211758375167847, 1, "today i say that we have an opportunity the camera of

nato allies we are saving thousands of lives what would have taken place historically if we had allowed the annihilation of the libyan people lets stick together on this from its inception this has

legislation when it passed in the house last december when it expired but unfortunately the senate shut down it would not be allowed to move forward by the republicans in the other body and it died inexplicably i dont understand the workings of the other body and why republicans would require supermajorities to move things through that will ultimately pass unanimously there was bipartisan support for this legislation in january in february march april may june i am proud to support it now and im pleased that the republican leadership and my friend chairman camp brought it forward but theres just as much support today as there was in january it made me feel bad that our friend from texas talked about the 21 million that was lost to his texas industries it didnt need to happen any night that we came into session at the beginning of any week the legislation could have come forward since january this is important and im pleased were having the discussion now i will do anything i can to lobby people in the other body to move forward with it but its part of a simple bipartisan agenda where theres no objection these are the sorts of things that can come forward in the 1960s a growing number of nations agreed that more needed to be done to bring the benefits of trade to the developing world and devised a system of trade preferences to meet this objective the united states enacted it first in 1974 and criteria under this system of preferences were not merely related to trade but reflected our nations social values when we inaugurated this program preferences in 1974 and included a statement of the policies we feel valuable in our trading partners and about which policies we feel drive the development of nations its often referred to as a tool of foreign policy as well as trade among the criteria we judge our trading partners on in eligibility for this program are the protection of american commercial interests like the protection of intellectual property the prevention of seizure of property belonging to united states citizens and businesses as well as the protection of individual rights such as the protection of commonly accepted labor rights and the elimination of child labor i wonder at this point if i may ask a question of my friend the chairman of the committee as i scanned the legislation i dont see any reference in the elements to the

today and it is a term of confidence the government shutdown shaved 1 to 2 points off of gross domestic product that is reality that is not fiction we need to get past again the harsh language that has now taken over this institution and provide investors and provide the american people with the idea of some confidence to unleash the forces of that 2 trillion that is sitting here domestically

play that have made congress uniquely vulnerable to this kind of massive deficit spending whatever the reason we know congress is not willing is not able or at least in recent years has not been inclined except in rare unusual circumstances to balance its own budget that being the case we cannot assume that congress will all of a sudden start doing its job as those who have used this argument have insisted part of congresss job as congress has come to perceive it is to engage in deficit spending one of congresss powers as members of congress who read the constitution will point out is to borrow money on the credit of the united states so it is not enough to simply tell congress to do its job because it has regarded this kind of massive deficit as consistent with that mandate consistent with that injunction meanwhile congress is continuing to occupy a larger and larger share of the american economy we have to remember that for the first 150 years or so of our republics existence we were spending between 1 percent and 4 percent of gross domestic product at the federal national level with only two brief exceptionsonce during the civil war and once during and then the immediate aftermath of world war i but that all started to change in the 1930s when we broke into double digits for the first time ever during peacetime we have never really gone back now the federal government is spending about 25 percent of gdp annually roughly a quarter out of every dollar that moves through the american economy every year is taken out of the real economy by washington it is absorbed within the federal morass that is our government that is a problem that needs to change i fear i suspect i firmly believe that it will not change until we take this power away until we at least impose severe restrictions on congresss borrowing power because it has become part of congresss nature to engage in this kind of outofcontrol deficit spending i would like to ask senator paul another question how does he think it would impact the lives of americans of kentuckians on a daytoday basis if we were to pass a amendment such as this and have it ratified by the states"],

essential points that you may want to repeat for the speaker but i just wanted to say that look you know the progressive caucuswere here with the progressive messageis thinking about these fiscal deadlines that this country is facing we do believe that we should try to come up with a fair deal in anticipation of sequestration and the expiration of deadlines on some taxes we believe that the top 2 percent of the income scale should have to pay more we believe that the defense department which has seen its budget double since 2001 should have to take cuts we believe we have to invest in jobs and get people back to work and we believe we should protect social security medicare and medicaid those are some takeaways that i think are very important we do believe in negotiating we believe that its important to do so weve already given up 1 5 trillion in the last term people talk about whats on the table whats off the table 1 5 trillion should be on the table as cuts that have already taken place id just like to leave the gentlelady the remaining time to summarize"]]}
