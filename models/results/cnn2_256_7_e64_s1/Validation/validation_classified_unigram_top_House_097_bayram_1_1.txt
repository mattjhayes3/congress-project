by political dispute could not make that has not happened yet i would also like to point out that the concessions when they come have to come from the turks the greeks have nothing left to concede they have been driven off a major portion of their island so it is the turks that have to make the political economic and diplomatic concessions i think this whole emphasis shows that the congress has not forgotten cyprus even though it is on the back burner of the news today i think i would be remiss if i did not note the fine delicate hand of the chief of staff of the committee dr brady in the final diplomacy that went into producing this resolution one more point that i would like to make is that despite fears to the contrary the papandreou government in greece is behaving in a responsible manner with respect to the united states in view of greeces importance to nato that is a wholesome development and a positive turn of events that can only be sustained if the united states prevails upon turkey to end its occupation of cyprus and concur in greeces aegean military responsibility for nato as it had before the 1974 invasion of cyprus it must be borne in mind that greece is the key

sale and transfer act of 1980 since that time this nation has witnessed another notable upsurge in crimes of violence committed with handguns the latest and most striking was of course the cowardly assassination attempt on president reagan chief justice warren e burger on february 8 1981 addressing the american bar association has described what he called a reign of terror in american cities something obviously must be done and done soon to reduce the incidence of violent crime in our country on tuesday i introduced a threebill package aimed at achieving this end first i reintroduced legislation which would ban the manufacture sale and importation of handguns except for police and military purposes second i introduced a bill that provides for stiff minimum mandatory sentencing with no possibility of a suspended sentence or probation for those convicted of cominiting violent crimes while armed with a handgun or and deadly weapon the third bill i introduced expands federal law to provide the death penalty for murdering a federal employee or official during an attempted presidential assassination it is an anomaly of our law that john hinckley will probably be prosecuted under federal law for the attempt on the presidents life but will be tried under local district of columbia law for shooting press secretary brady agent mccarthy and officer delahanty not only do the jurisdictions differ but the penalties are not the same had mr brady died under district of columbia law the death penalty could not be given under my legislation the president and all members of his entourage would be protected by the same law clearly the most important approach to solve the heavy burden of violence upon our society is as it always has been enforcement of the law this depends not only on strong police efforts to identify and apprehend offenders but on stiff sentencing once a conviction has been made after affording to the accused all the substantial individual protections of our constitution generally in our country we have experienced the former but have stumbled badly with respect to the latter congress on the other hand can only do so much unfortunately congress has chosen to do almost nothing together with stronger enforcement efforts the effect of stronger national laws as a statement of our rejection of violence would be salutary my remarks a year ago when i introduced h r 6892 the handgun sale and transfer act of 1980 seem even more relevant in the wake of recent events and i repeat them here we profess to be a country dedicated to the rule of law and governed by majority rule yet we have the highest level of violent crime of almost any country and a small but vocal minority has repeatedly thwarted any action in this area even though it is clearly supported by the majority the legislation i have introduced is realistic practical and possible of enforcement my handgun control bill does not seek to register handguns nor to confiscate those in existence nor to make handgun ownership unlawful all of these approaches are in my judgment not practical and would result either in another costly and useless bureaucracy or simply place another law on the books impossible of general enforcement the legislation i have introduced rather seeks to end trafficking in handguns by banning their manufacture sale and importation exceptions are made for police and military purposes handgun legislation alone of course is not enough state and federal laws providing for mandatory additional penalties for crimes committed with handguns or indeed with any deadly weapon are also necessary in addition and probably most importantly it is essential that all levels of government select judges who view the killing or maiming of a human being with a handgun or other deadly weapon as a matter so serious that the perpetrator receives the most serious form of punishment each of these approaches is essential the legislation i have introduced today is a small but important part of the whole concept that our society must reject violent crime and embrace the rule of law as the basis of our conduct and interaction the time has clearly come for the congress of the united states to take effective action to check the spread of violence threatening every person in our society i ask my colleagues to join with me in this effort"], [0.0006284117698669434,

gentleman from illinois at the very outset for i come from a district where at caterpillar tractor co we have seen workers taking pay reductions john deere freezing company pay and the steelworkers taking 1 65 an hour in cuts plus fringe benefits that aggregate nearly 4 an hour under those circumstances i find it difficult to just roll over and acquiesce to this proposal to lift the 4percent cap on federal civilian retirees benefits that was imposed in our budget resolution particularly at a time when you have the cost of living index at less than 3 percent for 4 or 5 months running what better time is there for capping a cola not only for federal retirees but for federal pay both military and civilianwise i would go one step further to say if we could have done it across the board even social security recipients could have lived with a 4percent increase effective july 1 it is just too bad that we did not all have the guts around here earlier in the year when that was one of the issues that was supposed to be addressed by the socalled gang of 17 now it is amusing yet tragic that we are considering this legislation today without notice without ample time to prepare without an opportunity for us to respond it is amusing because it so typifies the election year politics which has governed the conduct of this house of months and it is tragic because it represents a repudiation of the budget process and the neglect of our responsibilities as so well pointed out by my friend from ohio i suppose i must say it was good of the majority to even allow us to share the time on an equal basis for the debate let me try to lay some groundwork for the vote then if i might quickly on the rule itself it is important that members of this house and the american people understand the issues in this debate and the consequences of what we do first the substance of the legislation reported out of committee is irrelevant the substance of the one amendment contained in the rule is totally irrelevant it does nothing it means nothing it is absolutely nothing this house does not have one single opportunity to vote on anything that complies with the reconciliation instructions of the budget or that meet the binding procedures of the budget act yet we are given two opportunities here to repudiate reconciliation and violate the intent and purpose of the budget act second it should be understood this action we take here today has absolutely nothing to do with the economic recovery but it has everything to do with political recovery what we are engaging in here is not fiscal responsibility but political irresponsibility we are using the floor of the house for the drafting editing and approving of campaign news releases that is really what it is all about compare what we should be doing with what we are doing we shoud be considering a reconciliation bill reported out of the budget immittee under a rule that offers opposing views to be aired and the opportunity then to vote on amendments or substitutes that reflect those opposing views that is how the process is supposed to work as i understand it what are we doing first we are abandoning the reconciliation process and leaving the budget committee completely out in the cold we are saying in effect that the budget process means nothing if it does not facilitate the majoritys political needs we are not considering reconciliation in the context of fiscal responsibility we are being forced to consider individual bills tailored to embarrass and frustrate those in this house who supported the budget resolution in june and admittedly it was practically a unanimous vote here a significant body of votes over here not the majority so we understand the politics of what game is being played here the very best we could do here today the only opportunity we have is to meet about 80 percent of the reconciliation instructions that is it some choice some democratic process some reconciliation it is all a sham the american people are being taken for a long ride down memory lane back to the days of the tax and spend and tax and spend philosophy i would urge my colleagues to vote down this rule

obligation as a legislative body to fulfill the reconciliation instruction of the budget resolution those of us who still want to meet our obligations whatever the political consequences ought to be

for implementing the budget that is all right with me but just give us a chance to implement it those of us who voted for it and thought we had a good product we will face the tough votes if the votes

deficit but it was a budget whatever one may say about the presidents first efforts they were in writing they were clear they were through and they represented his best first effort as he and his staff saw it at that time they were a starting point now several months later several monts during which interest rates have remained high during which economic anxiety has increased during which the people of america have worried we are at an impassean impasse we have been at almost from the day the president offered his budget the major cause of that impasse is in this body the house of representatives the liberal democartic leadership in this body has refused to produce any alternative budget they have produced criticisms they have produced counterattacks they have produced comments but they have not shown how they would solve the fundamental problems for the last 3 weeks the republican leadership in the house and the senate has been meeting with the democratic leadership in the house and the senate with the help and assistance of the white house team that effort going on day after day in negotiating sessions seeking to find an answer that will bring down the budget deficit that will bring down interest rates that will create new jobs that will restart the housing and automobile industriesthat effort is still going on but today thanks to the speakers comments yesterday the effort is a little more doubtful the chance of success is a little weaker frankly in an election year it is tempting for all of us to be partisan it is tempting for everyone to seek advantage for their party but the fact is that while we talk in washington people are laid off across the country while we talk in washington high interest rates cripple housing and automobiles while we talk in washington small businesses are forced into bankruptcy i hope that the people of america will decide that their congressmen and their senators should join in an effort to seek a compromise i hope that there will be a nationwide outpouring of telegrams and letters and phone calls demanding that both parties join in an effort to seek compromise surely the nations economy the jobs the hopes of the

legitimate to disagree about tax rates it is legitimate to disagree about spending on social programs it is legitimate to disagree on the size of the defense budget but it hurts all of us when one side the side which controls the house of representatives the democratic party hides behind a cover of no figures no documents no budget and simply nitpicks the presidents proposals hopefully this compromise effort will yield results in the next 2 days however if we return next week and there are no results there is no compromise then i think it is urgent in the name of saving jobs and in the name of selling cars and selling houses in the name of revitalizing the american economy and bringing down interest rates it is vital that the democratic leadership bring their budget out in the open

what the future energy policy of this nation will be let me tell the members what we did when we went over to the other body as i say to my colleagues we did not carry this one over there we put a buffer in for the secretary of energy he does not have to rehire anybody that is totally false we gave him flexibility within these various accounts below his current onboard strength in other words our floors are below what his current employment is that is reflected in the facts at the department the people are on board our floor is below the hour is late everything we do is important i do not want to minimize this amendment it is important it involves what the energy policy of this nation will be and who will decide it will it be decided by us or will it be decided by flat based on rifs downtown i hope we will stick with the committee on this hopefully we will work out an agreement with the department of energy we certainly want to but we want to seeall of usan effective energy program in this country i believe and i think the members do too that next to the issue of war and peace the question of energy survivability of the united states in the future is one of the most critical issues that faces the nation we are not going to let anybodyanybodydecide that issue based on who they want to rif or what their own personal feelings are about what a given program is that

approve s 730 today s 730 as approved by the senate on may 5 will authorize the federal crop insurance corporation to use funds otherwise available for the payment of indemnities to cover administrative and operating expenses of the corporation incurred during the current fiscal year this legislation is need e because thq federal crop insurance corporation does not now have sufflclent 1981 funding to continue operation of the expanded crop insurance program for farmers authorized by the federal crop insurance act of 1980 although the department of agriculture requested funds for expansion of the crop insurance program last year the request did not reach congress in time for inclusion in the agricultural appropriations act for fiscal year 1981 however the department of agriculture received permisslon from the office of management and budget in december 1980 to begin expansion and requested a supplemental appropriation to cover the costs of expansion in fiscal year 1981 by the end of this week the funds apportioned to fcic on a deficiency basis will probably be exhausted furthermore i think it is obvious to everyone that it is unlikely that a supplemental appropriation can be enacted into law before the corporations funds run out a shortage of operating funds at this time will seriously jeopardise the crop insurance program spring is traditionally a period of increased program activity as farmers purchase insurance before planting moreover the department of agriculture is just beginning to implement the federal crop insurance act of 1980 the interruption of service to insured farmers will breach contractual commitments farmers have entered into with the corporation in good faith and will imperil successful implementation of the new allrisk crop insurance program as i speak these words fcic is formulating its plans to close down shop as required by the office of management and budget under the provisions of s 730 premiums collected from farmers and funds already transferred from the commodity credit corporation for the emergency payment of indemnities could be used temporarily to provide funds for the corporations administrative and operating expenses such authority would be applicable only to those administrative and operating expenses incurred during fiscal year during consideration of s 730 by the senate several members of that body expressed concern over the fact that this legislation would provide a kind of backdoor financing which would effectively get around the budget process and circumvent the 1981 budget i must confess that i share this concern and i well understand the reservations some of my colleagues may have on this matter however the bill we have before us was amended by the senate tospecifically limit the amount of money which can be transferred by the fcic for paying administrative and operating expenses the limit set in this legislation is 14 million and i am informed by usda officials that this amount is adequate to take care of the emergency needs of the corporation in the meantime work continues on the supplemental appropriations bill which contains a supplemental request for pcic of 42 2 million for administration and operations the 14 million authorized to be spent in this bill should be a sufficient amount to carry the corporation through the time necessary for congress to complete all actions on the supplemental bill i cannot emphasize too much the iurgency of this bill it would be tragic if the corporations activities were interrupted due to a shortage of operating funds these activities are vital to the economic wellbeing of the nations farmers the expanded crop insurance program we initiated in the last congress is a very significant program for the agricultural producers of the country and for the federal government this program enables producers to cope with disaster situations where after large investments in time and money have been made something occurs that is totally out of the control of the producers but brings about a considerable loss the program allows the disasters to be addressed in an economical logical and businesslike way we have been operating under a disaster payments program that has not been comprehensive it has been very expensive to the government and has in fact covered a relatively few number of producers and a very smail number of crops the protection offered in the crop insurance program which this bill addresses itself to is broad coverage it is available and will be available throughout the entire country covering a wide variety of crops covering losses that may be brought about by any kind of disaster so it is a program that deserves to be implemented in a very effective and efficient manner and should be expedited to the fullest extent possible what this bill does is to make it possible to continue to implement the crop insurance program so that these protections will be available to the agricultural producers of the country i urge my colleagues to act favorably on this legislation and speed it on to the president for signature"], [0.9945448148064315, 0.005455185193568468, 1, "i

imprecise cost projections overly optimistic schedules and management indecision during this regrettable period the congress has expressed concern that this lack of automated data processing service in the department of medicine and surgery has adversely impacted on the quality of health care delivered in va hospitals many of us in the house were very pleased when mr robert p nimmo issued his executive order of february 18 1982 providing new direction in use and control of computers and adp technology in the department of medicine and surgery with a policy of decentralization which places the emphasis on quality of health care rather than gathering data when the house and senate veterans affairs committees were briefed on his directive we were told that maximum effort would be exerted in implementing decentralization and that there would be no further development or expansion of the old centralized adp program apples we were also told that equipment and other sources intended for the expansion of ajples would be reprogramed to support the new decentralized policy we 1 re later amazed to learn that the administrators earlier executive order had been reversed and that a subsequent decision was made to go back to the original plan for a centralized system our committee learned that the expansion of certain apples comiss sites was made unilaterally by the office of data management and telecommunications mr chairman the appropriations committee has taken the position consistent with those of us on the veterans affairs committee who support a decentralized computer system for the department of medicine and surgery in a letter sent to the administrator on november 19 the ranking minority member of our committee the honorable john paul hammerschmidt and i asked the administrator not to proceed with the centralized comiss system and to begin immediately to implement the current decentralized system developed by the department of medicine and surgery at the same time we did not suggest any limitation on the veterans administration to develop options either through the private sector or otherwise where such options could possibly enhance or improve on the decentralized mumps system our position was simply that until the veterans administration has a better system it should begin immediately to implement fully the integrated mumps system we feel this would be cost effective but more importantly we feel the mumps system is the only system currently available that could be quickly implemented va hospitals must have computer capability if we are to provide quality care to veteran patients the overriding issue is the quality of care to be provided to veterans who receive their care and treatment in va medical centers the va is far behind the

gordon and dr william rogers a member of the history faculty of florida state university since 1959 spoke movingly and cloquently of the great contribution of president roosevelt to his country and the cause of freedom in the world i ask unanimous consent that their able remarks from the journal of the florida state senate follow my remarks in the record senator gonon mr president senators saturday january 30th will be the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of franklin delano roosevelt i was sort of distressed as i looked through the senate handbook and discovered there are only five of us here who would have been old enough to have voted for him at least once and probably not too many who can really remember the time he was president it is a significant memory for me because first of all it was the first presidential eetion in which i ever voted it wds in 1944 aboard a ship in the pacific voting absentee i also have a very vivid memory of the day he died i was in an infantry unit in okinawa and we got out of our foxholes that morning and got the news it was a time when we were faced daily with deatn of friends and buddies and yet the sadness of that day is something shared by everyone that i dont forget very easily also i happen to have a meme y of his inaugural i dont think anybody who really didnt live through the depression and understand it can really appreciate the kind of impact that he and his administration had but i remember his inaugural i renember the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and listening to that on the radio in detroit in a house that was about to be foreclosed and in a city where the banks had been closed for three or four months and where nobody really had any money what happens when you go over a budget and you dont have any money you print your own the city of detroit was paying its employees in script and if you went twenty miles outside into another city you could dis count that script for sixty or seventy cents in order to have some real dollars because everybody wouldnt take the script when you come through experiences like that it obviously molds the way i which you look at government and the way in which you look at life i thought that since today there is a joint session of congress which is going on for the purpose of comniemorating roosevelts birthday that the least we could do here in a state that roosevelt visited many times is have some few moments of examining that part of history so we asked dr sliger if there werent someone on the faculty at fsu who had a particular interest in the area he suggested we get dr william rogers it turned out that dr rogers was not only a wellknown local historian but a very popular teacher and his knowledge of the south seems to make him one of the most popular teachers the courses he instructs for the center for professional development are among those most soughtafter in the continuing education curriculum he has been a member of the fsu history faculty since 1959 he earned his bachelors and masters degrees from auburn he is a native of alabama he got his phd from the university of north carolina and wrote his dissertation on the populist movement in alabama the heritage of that populist movement we occasionally as a matter of fact quite often see here particularly among those of our members who come from north florida dr rogers who is noted for his ability to blow away the dry dust of history is here today to try to bring alive some of the memories of franklin roosevelt it is really a pleasure to introduce dr rogers dr rogens franklin delano roosevelt was born at hyde park new york on january 30 1882 he died at warm springs georgia of a cerebral hemorrhage on april 12 1945 in the remarkable career that spanned those sixtythree years he is best known to us and to history as the thirtysecond president of the united states he would have been one hundred years old this saturday fdr as he was popularly called came from dutch and english ancesters who had settled in the hudson river valley in the seventeenth century in 1887 when he was five roosevelt was introduced to the then president grover cleveland patting roosevelts head cleveland said my little man i am making a strange wish for you it is that you may never be president of the united states fdr was brought up as an aristocrat the family mansion overlooked the hudson river and he spent quiet summers in england had governesses and private tutors went to prep school at groton and was an undergraduate at harvard he was athletic active in campus activities and popular with his classmates but he was not a brilliant student at harvard roosevelt edited the crimson and graduated in 1904 later he attended law school at columbia university was admitted to the bar in 1907 and practiced law in new york in 1905 he married his distant cousin eleanor roosevelt they would have six children eleanors uncle theodore roosevelt himself came to new york to give the bride away in 1910 fdr entered politics and campaigning in a red maxwell convertible was elected to the state senate frd always liked to drive fastto the later dismay of secret service agents roosevelt had a lifetime love for the sea and for ships from 19131920 he happily served as assistant secretary oi the navy we know i ow about the affair between fdr and lucy mercer later mrs winthrop rutherford lucy was eleanors parttime social secretary the affair began apparently in 1917 eleanor found out and threatened a divorce at that time such a scandal would have ruined the career of any aspiring politician and so the affair ended in later years they met at different times and there is no doubt butthat the episode permanently scarred the relationship between eleanor and franklin tall slender handsome and articulate roosevelt was named as james m coxs running mate in 1920 the national election was a disaster for the democrats and a landslide victory for warren t harding and the republicans the defeated vice presidential candidate wrote to a friend franklin d roosevelt ex v p canned erroneously reported dead roosevelts political career seemed ended in 1921 after swimming in the cold waters of the bay of fundy off camptbello island where the family had a summer nome he had an attack of polio seemingly he was a hasbeen at thirtynine yet he made a courageous physical comeback even so he would never work again without the use of crutches and by wearing heavy iron braces during his recovery roosevelt was helped and encouraged by his wife and by louis howe an albany journalist he discovered the waters of warm springs and the small georgia town became a haven for him roosevelt had dshi and flair like his fifth cousin teddy in 1924 he laboriously made his way to the podium of the national democratic convention and placed the name of governor al smith of new york before the delegates fdr called him the happy warrior smith had to wait until 1928 to get the nomination and then he lost to herbert hoover that same year roosevelt was elected governor of new yurk this placed him in the national limelight and made him a contender for the democratic nomination in 1932 meantime the great depression hit with devastating impact and rightly or wrongly hoover got the blame we were in the most severe economic crisis in our history unemployment and breadlines were daily watchwords fdr renewed his quest for the nomination and aided by james a farley a political wizard who knew everybody and signed his chatty letters in green ink got it accepting the nomination roosevelt promised us a new deal in 1932 most of us knew nothing about fdr he seemed slightly snobbish and he certainly spoke in patrician tones walter lippman the nations most respected political analyst wrote of fdr that he is a pleasant man who without any important qualifications for the office would very much like to be president roosevelt accordhig to lippman simply does not measure up to the tremendous demands of the office of president roosevelt not only won the nomination he won the election at his inauguration he told us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyzes efforts to convert retreat into advance congress was called into special session for the famous hundred days and the nation got an unprecedented amount of legislation designed to combat and get us out of the great depression we got the national industrial recovery act the securities and exchange act the civil works administration the tennessee valley authority the agricultural administration act a civilian conservation corps was established and so was a public works administration still later would come the national labor relations act the national youth administration the social security act the works progress administration and many others since roosevelt was elected four times we can conclude that his political abilities were exceptional brilliant and probably touched with genius he had a streak of engaging good humor surface geniality and the gift of dramatizing political issues opponents saw him as cynical vindictive devious a doubledealer a man with an insatiable thirst for power admirers viewed him as warmhearted humanitarian courageous and magnanimous the truth lay somewhere between the extremes but he was a highly complex personality roosevelt was a pragmatist he said it is common sense to take a method and try it if t fails admit it frankly and try another la above all try something in truth the new deal brcame an intricate set of compromises after the new deal the government would never again be considered a mere umpire for economic and social activity it became a participant roosevelt was a magnificent speaker his fireside chats were called exercises in mass hypnotism americans huddled around their radios listening to fdr speak really thought he was talking to them personally in the bleak 1930s we welcomed a voice of concern not surprisingly he inspired both love and bitter hatred we wrote him letters like we had never wr tten letters before we certainly pulled no punches one person wrote dear president roosevelt im proud of our united states and every time i hear the starspangled banner i feel a lump in my throat there aint no other nation in the world that would have sense enough to think of wpa and all the other as another wrote my dear sir it is expensive and a headache to have a playboy as president wipe that grin off your face and so it went one wrote dear honored mr roosevelt i never saw a president i would write to until youve got in your place but i have alivays felt like you and your wife and your children were as common as we were another sincere and earthy tribute came from a tired textile worker in north carolina who wrote fdr youre the only president weve ever had who would understand that my boss is a s o b roosevelt did not pull the country out of the depression but his confidence gave us confidence he was flamboyant and charisrmatic he projected an image of caring if some of his programs failed others succeeded the jaunty thrust of this face which led some to call him moosejaw pleased most of us voters if he wanted to wear pincenes glasses use a long cigarette holder and drink two old fashions a day iwe didnt care his reelection in 1936 was mindboggling he carried every state except maine and vermont after the votes were counted someone hung a large banner across the highway leading from new hampshire into maine it read you are now leaving the united states by the late 1930s the domestic new deal waned and foreign affairs became uppermost we know that roosevelt broke historical precedent in 1940 when he became the first president to be elected for a third term he was reelected for a fourth term in 1944 fdr presided over the nations fortunes during world war ii the crises the tension the responsibilitiesall were demanding and all took their toll he was a highly successful commander during the conflict and both friends and foes concede that in many ways he was a casualty of the war although fdr looked terrible in his last months his sudden death shocked us all it upset me as a boy in a rural town in south alabama it simply was unacceptable any other man as president was inconceivable yet he was dead roosevelt was mortal he was flesh and blood he certainly made mistakes but he is one of the giants of the twentieth century this enigmatic personality was truly a world

accord on transportation of perishables atp signatory nations can and o impose atp requirements on containers owned by citizens of nonsignatory countries although americanowned and operated equipment consistently exceeds the atp standards and specifications it is often subject to harassment and transportation delays simply because the united states is not a signatory of this agreement these delays could cause significant disruptions to the flow of unitedstates agricultural exports the senate by a 920 vote has already given its advice and consent to this treaty however before the state department can actually sign this treaty legislation must be enacted which would assign responsibility for administration of the treaty to the secretary of agriculture h r 6164 designates the secretary of agriculture as the properly authorized person to administer this act and fulfills the necessary prerequisite to the united states becoming a signatory of the treaty this act will make it possible for equipment in the united states to be inspected tested and certified in accordance with the agreement and the standards specified therein this act will improve the conditions for the movement of perishable foodstuffs in international carriage in equipment owned or operated by unitedstates firms which will serve to protect existing trade and promote expansion of trade in perishable foodstuffs and will improve the sale of unitedstates manufactured equipment for use in international carriage ii 2277 h 2278 co in administering this act the secretary is authorized tofirst designate

medical colleges in which they say they have no objection to the provisions of the bill if there is no intention of removing the authority under section 301 a of the public health service act of course we made no change in section 301 a what is being referred to is a fight that took place 2 years ago on the authoriation of nih when the gentleman rom illinois along with his predecessor dr tim lee carter the ranking minority member on our subcommittee and most of the house supported speclic authorizations for all 11 of the institutes at nih i think that policy has a lot to say for it in terms of t responsibility an authorizing committee has for an agency for which we authorize funds but rather than get into that kind of heated debate this year we agreed with the aamc and others that we would not do what the gentleman indicates the blue sheet says we intended to do we abandoned that approach in this bill i want to make very clear to the gentleman that no matter what a blue green yellow or red sheet may say this bill does not in any way take away the authority granted to the appropriations committee to appropriate funds under section 301 of the law"], [0.007919758558273315,

home administration what have you done to the soil conservation service what have you done to specific line items in this budget i have listened here and half of the discussion we have had today is about specific items within the budget i would like to begin my statement by making the point that the only thing that is binding in the budget is the functional categories and even the functional categories on a point of order are binding only on the bottom line so no matter what we do here we are not directing funds to a specific program or away from a specific program if the distinguished chairman of the committee in his talking papers or backup material has listed programs that he contemplates funding within the functional categories we in no way fund his programs by adopting his budget if the distinguished minority member of the budget lommittee presents increases above the baseline for specific programs and we adopt his budget substitute which i support we do not fund those increases all we do is provide money for that functional category and i think it is very important that we realize it within that context i would like to address this body the housing bill that was adopted by the house and about whether or not it can be accommodated in the latta budget the answer is clearly that it can be accommodated in the latta budget and let me explain why first of all in the 1982 budget the functional numbers of the resolution are not binding hence the congress can in the process of completing action on supplemental appropriations adjust the relative priorities to accommodate whatever it deshes to do within the bottom line budget totals but in this particular case we have the happy coincidence that we are going to end fiscal year 1982 in the commekce and housing credit function with 16 283 951 000 of unobligated budget authority we therefore have the ability in this house to reallocate possibly out of section 8 housing 1 billion to the housing progran in budget authority for fiscal year 1982 i do not think the point has been challenged which has been made here that the latta resolution explicitly plans for such action in the 1983 through 1985 totals the latta resolution treats spendouts from the 1982 supplementals in an identical manner to the jones and aspin resolutions so it may be that in the listing of what they contemplate that the chairmans budget resolution explicitly takes the housing bill into account it may be that the ranking minority members substitute does not but the bottom line is that the budget authority is there in the commerce and housing credit function that this house if it chooses to spend that money clearly can spend it under the budget act it is also true that in 1983 1984 and 1985 the resolution offered by mr larra carries the same spendout assumptions for the supple mentals as does the budget offered by"], [0.008462309837341309, 0.5084623098373413, 0, "these last several weeks of dealing with budget and tax matters have been most trying on all of us the congress has worked its will on a host of measures we hope will revitalize our economy and strengthen our productive sector during consideration of the first concurrent budget resolution and the omnibus reconciliation bill we gave the new president much of what he wants however in the omnibus reconciliation bill both the house and senate inserted provisions which would eliminate social security minimum benefits in retrospect that move wvas i think a little shortsighted the conference locked in this provision which will now become effective in february of next year with the march 1982 social security checks reflecting the elimination of the benefits on july 21 by a vote of 40513 we passed house resolution 181 in an attempt to effect the removal of the minimum benefit elimination provision that effort was unsuccessful though because of the senates refusal to do the same today we have an opportunity a second chance if you will to repeal the minimum benefit provision before it takes effect and perhaps insure that those 1 million or so retirees between the ages of 70 and 90 who cannot qualify for supplemental security income will continue to receive the small 122 per month sum for their remaining years 1 like most of the members of this body received a large volume of mal from elderly constituents asking that their minimum benefits not be eliminated these are not people who have nice pensions and substantial investments to see them through their remaining years they are in most cases people who live from month to month in an economy where it is difficult at best to make ends meet for most americans let alone those on fixed incomes i am in agreement with the president on the need to get the federal budget under control and i commend him for his efforts to take certain steps toward this end which should have been taken long ago but in my second thoughts on the provisions of the reconciliation bill i think we can look to other areas of spending to achieve the presidents goal in the meantime let us leave the minimum benefit intact and show a little compassion for those on minimum fixed incomes by repealing the elimination provision this is what our elderly constituents asked us to do and by a 40513 vote on july 21 we agreed that their requests were not too much to ask for let us give this
