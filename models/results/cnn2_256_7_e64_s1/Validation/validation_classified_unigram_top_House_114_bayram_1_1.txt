colleagues for being here this is an important issue there is no question about that we are here because we are outraged we are outraged at republican attempts to undermine our child nutrition programs we are outraged at their lousy child reauthorization bill it is a terrible terrible terrible bill my friends should be ashamed of this bill a nutritious school meal is just as important to a childs success in school as a textbook hungry children cant concentrate they cant focus on their studies in short hungry children cannot learn that is a fact everybody knows that yet we have a bill that my republican friends have drafted that will increase hunger and that will actually take food out of the mouths of children it is outrageous together our child nutrition programs wic school breakfast and lunch the summer food service program and the child and adult care food program provide nutritional support for children year round in places where they live learn and play unfortunately h r 5003 which is the republican reauthorization bill includes a number of harmful provisions that would roll back years of progress and hamper the ability of children to access healthy meals as i said to be very blunt it makes hunger worse in this country specifically the bill would undermine the successful community eligibility provision which some of my colleagues have talked about first included in the last reauthorization bill that has allowed highpoverty school districts to offer universal school meals to all students in its first 2 years cep helped more than 8 5 million lowincome students access free meals instead of building on the success of this program my republican friends would severely restrict schools eligibility for the community eligibility option the center on budget and policy priorities estimates that 7 022 schools currently using community eligibility would lose it under this republican bill and another 11 647 schools that qualify for community eligibility but who have not yet adopted it would be prevented from doing so in the future as we approach the summer months it is also important to remember that child hunger gets worse in the summer consider this for every six children who get a lunch in school each day only one receives a meal in the summertime instead of being a carefree time for children who depend on getting healthy reliable meals during the school year the summer months can be a time of stress anxiety and hunger but it doesnt have to be this way unfortunately this republican bill cuts the successful summer ebt pilot program which provides a temporary boost in food assistance benefits during the summer months for families whose children receive free school meals during the school year and it fails to make necessary investments to expand the reach of summer food service programs so that more kids have access to healthy summer meals in their neighborhoods in addition this bill rolls back as my colleagues have mentioned evidencebased standards that make school meals healthier usda estimates that more than 90 percent of schools have successfullyhave successfullyimplemented these standards my grandmother used to say to me when i was growing up that an apple a day keeps the doctor away i wish she was still alive so i could tell her she was right food is medicine when we eat good food we eat nutritious food we tend to have healthy lives if you eat bad food if you eat junk food then you end up getting health issues like diabetes like high blood pressure and like obesity i could go on and on and on why in the world would anybody want to lower the nutrition standards in our school meals to give our kids junkier less nutritious food what sense does that make if my colleagues who are advocating these reversals of smart policy are doing so only because they want to save a few dollars then let me tell you something you are saving nothing if we dont get this right if we dont insist that our kids have access to nutritious healthier food the medical costs associated with the health challenges that they will experience are astronomical as my colleague from wisconsin mentioned earlier hundreds of billions of dollars in avoidable healthcare costs as a result of children not having access to good food 15 million children face hunger in this country instead of undoing the success we have already achieved congress should be focused on ways we can strengthen these vital child nutrition programs let me say finally it is hard for me to understand why we have to be here today why everything is a fight when it comes to dealing with issues of hunger and when it comes to dealing with issues and making sure our kids get access to good nutrition it is always a fight it is always a fight to protect so many vital food and nutrition programs that help our kids there is either a shocking ignorance about the reality of the poverty that millions of our children face in this country or there is simply indifference those are the only two ways i can explain what is going on in this chamber whichever one it is it is a sad excuse for what my republican friends are trying to do lets come together this should be a bipartisan issue there was a time when fighting hunger and when making sure that our kids had access to nutritious food was a bipartisan issue george mcgovern and bob dole worked together in the 1970s to strengthen our food and nutrition programs but now in this chamber these issues have become controversial it is sad because there are a lot of people in this country who are depending on us to find ways to end hunger in america they are depending on us to make sure that their kids when they go to school have access to nutritious food and that they have access to nutritious food during the summer months as well why are my friends making it so difficult enough enough of this stop beating up on the most vulnerable people in this country lets come

i will be discussing this evening but today again we are in serious jeopardy of having an important right of the american people neutered from them taken away from them by a power play here in washington d c being conducted by multinational corporations who have done everything they can to impact on this system while the american people do not know that there is an attempted move against their constitutional rights alerted by an aggressive yet an unsuccessful attempt to stop this rigorous and rancorous legislation in the house the senate was inundated last year about a similar bill that was supposed to be reform and it was very similar to the one that i will be discussing today there was so much opposition to that bill in the senate that they simply refused to bring it up to the floor for consideration the bill had already passed the house and as i say today a similar bill now is making its way through the house and will be on the floor and it is a great threat to the freedom security and wellbeing of the american people what was that issue that was rammed through the house and once it was exposed that the senate turned it back well it has been an ongoing fight over 20 years a classic case of crony capitalism that plagues our country the big guys are trying to diminish the rights of the little guys in order to make more moneysurprise surprise in this case however what we are talking about they will not only make more money and take that from the little guys but it will undermine americas prosperity and security in the long run i am certainly not opposed to the profit motive but first and foremost we need to ensure that powerful forces dont change the economic rules in order to enrich themselves unseen by most americans who are not paying attention but are paying attention to the important things in their lives their children their families their jobs their schools and their churches but they have been basically unaware that there is an attempt by megamultinational corporations to undermine and yes destroy a constitutional right of our citizensthis in order to fill their pockets at the expense of the american people who dont really understand and even know this power play is going on i am referring to an attack on the fundamental constitutional right of the american people to own what they have created this is a right that has been written into the law at the constitutional conventionit is in our constitutionthat is under attack in a clandestine legal maneuver that would neuter americas inventors the protection that they were granted by the constitution and permit powerful multinational corporations to steal what rightfully belongs to american inventors as granted to them as a right in the constitution thus ordinary americans of course are not as able to get their voices heard at times here in congress and big corporations are they have whole stables of lobbyists tonight we need to mobilize the american people and have them make sure that they contact their member of congress i will alert my fellow colleagues to make sure that they pay attention to what is happening in this piece of legislation that is now being rammed through congress it isnt just about of course dispossessing this issue isnt just dispossessing individual inventors it is a power grab that if they are successful in undermining the constitutional rights of inventors to own for a given period of time what they have created this change in our constitutional law will undermine the prosperity that we have enjoyed as americans the less than forthright attack on our patent system will undermine the economic wellbeing of our working people who depend on the united states to be technologically superior in order so that they can outcompete other peoples in other countries who come from poor societies who work just as hard but dont have the technological advantage that we americans have the american working people have always had the advantage that they can be more productive because our country permitted the technological development of the means of production that made our workers the most productive in the world people are working hard all over the world but it was the people of the united states who coupled that with freedom and coupled that with technology and it uplifted everyone our founding fathers believed that technology freedom and yes the profit motive was the formula that would uplift humankind they wrote into our constitution a guarantee of the property rights of inventors and authors it is the only place in the body of our constitution where the word right is used in article i section 8 clause 8 of the constitution of the united states the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries this provision has served america well it has led to a general prosperity and national security and it has permitted average people in our country to live decent lives and to have good jobs but instead now we are putting all of that at risk because some multinational corporations want to steal the technology that has been developed by our little guys our small inventors our small and independent inventors are where the new ideas come from these big meganational corporations have huge bureaucracies that are not the source of the great discoveries that we have had over the last two centuries americans work hard as i say but so do all the other people in the world it is technology that makes the difference our technology has multiplied results of that hard work yes that is the secret of our success technology and freedom that was put in place not just because we talk about it but because we wrote that into our law our basic fundamental law the constitution and we have developed from that moment the strongest patent system in the world and that is what has made all the difference benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson were men who believed in technology believed in liberty and freedom and believed that we could uplift every human being not just the elite in our society thus they made sure that in our constitution we had this provision that we set our course toward uplifting all people through technology hard work freedom and the profit motive yet today multinational corporations run by americansand maybe by some multinational corporations that just have americans working for themwant to diminish the patent protection our founding fathers put in place want to diminish the patent protection that has served us so well and over the years we fought and turned back several efforts to weaken the patent system the american people are unaware of this they are unaware that for the last 20 years there has been this attemptand they call it harmonizing our patent system with the rest of the world when we have the strongest system and they were trying to weaken it how does the rest of the world respect the rights of the little guy they dont in fact our patent system has said that if a man or a womanan inventorapplies for a patent overseas that after 18 months anybody who applies for a patent over there has a different situation than our patent applicants an inventor who applies for a patent in the united states knows that his patent application will be totally confidential until the moment he is issued the patent when that patent is issued then it can be published but he then has the legal power to protect his patent rights for a given period of time traditionally that has been 17 years of guaranteed protection well that is not the way the rest of the world works the rest of the world wants 18 months eighteen months after you apply for a patent they publish it for the whole world to see even if the patent has not been issued thus any inventor in that case everything that he or she has invented and all of the research is now made available to ones competitors that destroys incentive and in fact that was the goal 20 years ago that marcy kaptur of ohio and i were able to stop that provision from being put in the law because of what they were trying to do in harmonizing this law was that every american todaythink about itevery american inventor today anybody who didnt get their patent in 18 months it would be published to the world and we would have a massive stealing of our technology and undercutting of our technological superiority i might add the other thing they were trying to accomplish was they saidand overseas they dont have this guaranteeand that is if you apply for a patent if it takes you 10 years to get your patent you still have 17 years of guaranteed patent protection from the time it is issued overseas they start the clock ticking at 20 years when you file if you file for a patent and it takes you lets say 10 years to get your patent in the united states you would have 17 years of protection overseas you end up with 10 sometimes 5 years of protection we have the strongest system in the world it has worked for us now we have people over the last 20 years who have tried everything they could to undermine it we won those early fights against the two provisions i just described well after a few years of this of course marcy kaptur a strong coalition and i managed to thwart those efforts but today we see anotheranothereffort to try to undermine and diminish the patent protection that we have been fighting to preserve for these last 20 years 31 2 years ago the house passed the america invents act which we warned fundamentally diminished the patent system weakening its protection for ordinary citizens the negative impact of that billand that is just 31 2 years agothe negative impact is overwhelming we changed for example the fundamental idea in that bill one of the ideas that was changed from our countrys founding it was always the first person to invent something and can prove they invented it they will get the patent well they have changed it to the first not to invent they changed that to the first one to file for a patent is going to get the patent so that smaller and independent inventors who cant afford to go over and over again and every new twist of their invention get a separate patent for these small inventors have been facing major corporations that then immediately will go in and file for patent after patent after patent because they can afford it what they have done now is these corporations are flooding the patent office with applications of course there are not more people working in the patent office thus they are feeling a dramatic reduction in their ability to get the job done because they are being flooded with patent application because we have changed the basic rules of the game and it has worked against technological development in our country the onslaught as i said of course is aimed at neutering the rights of the small inventor we have barely turned back this latest attempt which last year we passed through the house and went to the senate but when the senators of course got a message from their own colleges and universities as to what this would do and the damage that it would do to the universities we were able to stop it and stop the effort in the senate now we have the american innovation act that has been presented here this is yet the most recent onslaught over a 20year battle of trying to protect the interests of the little guy now we have the american innovation act let me just suggest that these big megacorporations over the years who have stepped up with these proposals that would diminish the right of the small inventor didnt say we are trying to diminish the rights of the small inventor that is not what was being sold to the members of congress instead what was sold in the first onslaught 20 years ago was the submarine patent that is why we have got to eliminate the ability for people to have a patent application that is secret until it is granted that is why at 20 years from filing you dont have any more patent protection well that was a derogatory term that was used to confuse the public in order to try to secure their goal of diminishing the right of all inventors especially small inventors they are insisting of course now that there is another threat and that we should pay attention to this other threat that has emerged that should motivate us to again diminish the rights of american inventors to protect their own patent because supposedly patent law is being abused by the socalled patent trolls now what are patent trolls let me note that we all understand that there are frivolous lawsuits that take place throughout the american system we have a system of justice you can sue someone if that person has damaged you yet there are frivolous lawsuits lawyers will do that and we know that that is something we have got to deal with judges need to be stronger in that case but they exist and yes there are frivolous lawsuits that are presented by lawyers over patent right infringement and sometimes these frivolous lawsuitsand many timesare just based on phony claims that they claim they have the right in the patent to this and they sue some businessman hoping he will just pay off that is indeed a problem it is not a major problem in the sense that it is a minor part of all of the litigation that goes on almost all the patent litigation that goes on and most of the lawyers who are involved in this who are called patent trolls are involved with legitimate claims against people who have infringed on the patent rights of especially small inventors they are basically getting involved with the small inventor who does not have the resources to basically defend his patent against some large megamultinational corporation but of course big corporations would have us believe that what we are really talking about are frivolous lawsuits against them no there are many many positive lawsuits that are totally justified the vast majority of all lawsuits that come into play against these major corporations are based on a legitimate claim by someone who owns a legitimate patent who these big companies have just tried to rip off and so what they are trying to do now is what they are trying to make it more difficult for those little guys even with any type of help from what they call a patent troll to be able to actually bring their case of infringement against large corporations what this basically is saying is we have got to change our justice system we have got to change the rules of the game for every lawsuit because some people have been manipulating the law and having frivolous lawsuits i dont think that that is what we want in america we dont want to take away the right the legitimate right to go and defend yourself in court because some people use the courts in a frivolous or a manipulative manner if the small inventor doesnt have the resources for example to enforce his or her own patent and if they have been granted this patent legitimately by the federal government that they own this technology that they have developed then there is nothing wrong with the fact that someone could come along and help them enforce it when a megamultinational corporation is basically stealing their rights i have consulted with a number of outside individual inventors and groups they have affirmed to me that the legislation now being proposed in h r 9 the bill that was already passed through the judiciary committee that that bill disadvantages the little guy against deeppocketed corporations and in fact every provision in the name of stopping patent trolls is a provision that would undermine the efforts of people who own legitimate patents and have legitimate patent claims and undermine their ability to enforce those claims so basically we are saying and what is being said about patent trolls yes there are frivolous lawsuits and trolls sometimes are involved with frivolous lawsuits but by and large that does not mean that the overwhelming number of lawsuits are not legitimate and they should have every right to call on someone to help them in their effort basically to defend their patent rights proponents of this legislation are covering the fact that what we really have here is a bill on h r 9 that makes it easier for big corporations to steal the technology secrets of the little guys they would have us believe that all lawsuits are frivolous and the frivolous lawsuits are throughout our system and instead of focusing just on frivolous lawsuits they want us to have an overall diminishing of the rights to our inventors to enforce their patents and make it more difficult for them to do so so tonight i draw the attention of the american people to h r 9 the innovation act as i say was introduced by chairman goodlatte and was passed through just a week ago or 2 weeks ago in the judiciary committee in the last congress the house judiciary committee held hearings on this bill and witnesses at that hearing included director kappos and others that was when we were discussing the america invents act and people said lets go slow on this why are we trying to push this through in such a hurried manner well they are trying to push it through in a hurried manner because once people understand the implications of diminishing the right of people to protect their patents they are going to find it has dramatic changes to the american way of life for example our universities now have discovered that if indeed h r 9 passes that it will have a huge impact on the viability of their own scientific research and their own patents that they own by these various universities it will diminish the value of patents across the board if we say that it is going to be more difficult to fight infringers and more costly for someone to fight someone who is infringing on that patent so according to sponsors of h r 9 this is as i say an attempt to control the trolls but in fact it is going to control the universities it is going to control other companies other than these big companies that as i say are multinational companies they are mainly in the electronics industry those people may want to take away some of these patent rights and let them sue but that is not true in many others you have got pharmaceuticals and biotech and many other industries that will be impacted in a horrible way because of h r 9 now what we need to do is make sure that the american people speak to their member of congress and talk to them about we do not want to make it more difficult for people who have developed new technologies to defend their technologies against infringers we dont want to make it more difficult for people who are the innovators to innovate to come up with the new ideas to basically make sure that america is on the cutting edge and leading the way and if we have harmonized with the rest of the world as has been their goal for a long timeand i might add one of the things that we have to be very concerned about when we look at the trade bill that is being shoved through congress is whether or not it will contain a provision that i helped defeat 20 years ago which i just mentioned that will make sure that our patent applications are published after 18 months now i have been told that that is in the trade bill and there have been all sorts of denials and some people are coming to me whispering yes it is in there well we know we are operating under secrecy we have been operating under secrecy here so it is impossible for me to tell the public i know absolutely because i read it because had i read about this in that bill i wouldnt be permitted to talk about it but that is another one of those things that you have got to be very careful what are you going to pass in this trade bill it might be exactly what i am talking about which is a diminishing of the patent rights of the little guy and who is pushing that megacorporations multinational corporations the same guys who are pushing this trade bill on us and not letting us even know what is in the trade bill which we are supposed to give up our right for an upordown vote not even knowing what is in that bill so what we need to do is make sure we go through all of those items in this bill h r 9 and people have to understand that every one of those provisions in this bill are aimed at making it more difficult for the small inventor to go up against a major corporation who is infringing on that inventors creation so how come we have got bills now that we can be bringing to the floor and that are aimed at helping the big guy steal from the little guy this is not what america is all about this isnt what our founding fathers had in mind the results of h r 9 will be increased patent infringement meaning the little guys will have more and more of what they are developing stolen from them and thus there will be less incentive for the geniuses in our society to use that genius to create the new technologies that keep us safesafe it is our technological edge that keeps us safe that makes us prosperous we cant be prosperous unless we are the innovators unless we are the guys with the new ideas rather than the people who are just copying other people our working people will not have a decent standard of living this will reduce the legal remedies for those who have been infringed upon it will reduce investment into small businesses that are aimed at technological development why would anybody want to invest with a small inventor or a small company that is developing technology if you are going to make it more and more difficult for that investor to get that money back if someone is stealing that technology and of course it will do irreparable damage to our research universities our inventors our entrepreneurs our economy and our nation every part of the socalled reform is detrimental to the patent owners and especially individual innovators will be damaged every provision bolsters the patent thieves the infringers at the expense of the legal owners all this done covered by the idea well we have got to get at the trolls i would like to share with you and with my colleagues just the story of exactly how that word troll came up there is a head of a major corporation who changed his mind on this bill who years ago was part of the clique pushing this sort of diminishing of patent rights he told me that he sat in a room with other corporate executives to come up with the strategy how are we going to get the american people to support legislation that actually hurts the little guy and helps the big guy steal from the little guy how are we going to do that well we need a straw man we need something to get attention that is going to make it look like that is really the goal is to take care of that evil sinister person over there they went around the circle trying to come up with a name that was so sinister that would help them accomplish their mission this is how cynical these people are who are offering this argument about trolls and finally the guy who was talking to me said i suggested patent pirate but by the time it got around patent troll sounded so much more sinister they decided they would accept that well this is absolutely absurd the fact is that if we are going to beat this onslaught of the big guys against the little guys we little guys have got to stick together we have got to make sure that we notify our members of congress and talk to other members we have got to pay attention because this is just another example of when we are not paying attention we lose our freedom we lose our freedom our rights are diminished you can count on the fact with the diminished rights of our inventors wages in this country will go down our competitiveness will go down we will not be secure we will not be prosperous this is an important issue yet they are trying to get this by with as little debate and as little attention as possible now how important is this well it has always been important to our country if we didnt have this patent protection that i am talking about our country would be totally different let me suggest this if you look back and see what our founding fathers had in mind they wanted the little guys to be protected and have legal rights this is what our country was all about and the innovation and the rights of ownership this was our innovation this is what benjamin franklin talked about and put into our constitution and that has worked so well for us if we cut off the little guys and if we make sure that they are not going to profit from their hard work and their struggle we will not have the new technologies we will not be the leader in technology in the world and we will fall behind and every one of us will be hurt by this one only needs to see how important technology was to our society one only needs to take a look here in the halls of congress there is a statue here in the capitol of philo farnsworth now who the heck knows who philo farnsworth was they have done a special on him on education tv i understand on the history channel philo farnsworth was someone who really was important to our country and there is a statue to philo farnsworth right here in the capitol he was a farmer in utah a man who was educated in engineering but who had very little resources in fact he was a farmer he set out between farming to try to find out and discover a technological secret that had perplexed some of the most powerful and financial interests in our country rca at that timethis was back at the turn of the century in 1910 and 1920was under a man named david sarnoff he was americas premier executive at the premier technology company of the united states a company that had vast resources and was deeply involved with trying to find out how to invent a picture tube they knew what the radio tube was but they didnt know how to make images on it how could they make that radio tube show images this is what they really were looking for and they had invested so much in it it was a huge challengean historic challengethat rca dumped millions of dollars of research into however they didnt discover it the one who discovered the secret of the picture tubeand it has had so much impact on the american way of life since everything we havecell phones computers you name itis based on a picture tubewas philo farnsworth this independent inventor this farmer from utah discovered the secret he wrote rca naively believing that this big corporation would honor his discovery and permit him to at least have the benefit of being recognized as the person who made this discovery then rca when they got the letter from philo farnsworth sent a representative to the laboratory there in utah which was in his barn i believe when he described to these top engineers from rca what he had found the scientists from rca went away saying oh yes we will be back in touch with you of course they never did get back in touch once they learned of his secret the thing that philo knew was his he ends up reading an announcement in a magazine of how rca had made this major breakthrough this discovery except philo knew he was the one who had discovered it and he was the one who had transmitted that information to rca this became one of the great jury and great legal battles of the 20th century philo farnsworth an individual personnot a wealthy person the little guywas up against the most powerful american corporation of the day rca which had one of the strongest and toughest leaders this corporate leader david sarnoff had a whole stable full of tough wellpaid lawyers all of whom vowed not to give one penny to philo farnsworth and not to recognize him because rca deserved to get the credit and the money philo farnsworth was able to mobilize support behind his claim people invested in philo farnsworths claim and it went all the way to the supreme court he was able to have people invest in his lawsuit slowly but surely they made their way through the court systemas i say all the way to the supreme court god bless the united states of america a poor single manan individual farmercame up against one of the most powerful corporations in america at the time because he had invented something the supreme court decided with philo farnsworth over this brutally powerful corporation in america rca was beaten by an individual farmer but he had people who had invested in him had the same laws they are trying to promote now in h r 9 been in place philo farnsworth and the other little guys who have invented things like this throughout our countrys history would have been betrayed there would have been nothing he could have done because h r 9 would have prevented him from having had people invest in his lawsuit that is what h r 9 does it says if a big corporation has stolen from you and if somebody has invested in helping you with your invention they then become liable if you have to sue to get your money if something happens where the big guys wineven if you are right and they win because they have better lawyersanybody who invests in you has to pay part of the legal fees of these big corporations which are millions of dollars of legal fees no one is going to want to invest in a little guy like that the philo farnsworths would be left out in the cold the nature of our system would have been totally different than what it is today if we were to have had the provisions of h r 9 which they are trying to foist on us now let me give you another example black americans happen to be some of the most inventive people in the united states a lot of people dont know that if you look back in the history of the patent office as i have been looking what you will find is while black americans were being discriminated against in general throughout our whole system the patent office was the one place that they had equal rights to come up with their ideas and to say this is what i have discovered because of that we have many great black inventors maybe that is the reason former chairman of the judiciary committee john conyers is taking my side in this debate on h r 9 he is opposed to that we have a black inventor for example who was the guy who invented the machine that permitted us to mass produce shoes before that time americans had one pair of shoes we started to mass produce them because this black american struggling on his own because he was discriminated against like all black americans were in that day managed to get his patent accepted and he changed not only himself but the whole country had shoes after that isnt that wonderful that is what happens when you have freedom for the little guy and not just for the big guys they come up with the new ideas they can uplift everybody and make sure everybodys feet feel better we are on the verge of losing that now we are on the verge of losing that when i go out in the hallway of congress here i see a statue to philo farnsworth that is where it is it is the statue of this utah farmer who invented the picture tube and who had to take on the biggest company and the biggest corporate powers in the world and he won i will tell you that there is his statue there and that there is no statue to david sarnoff the corporate leader who tried to beat him down and steal his technology i do not care how rich and powerful he was we respect the little guy in this country we want the little guys to be able to have rights that are protected by our constitution that is why our founding fathers put it in the constitution many of these megacorporations especially electronic corporations dont care one bit about the wellbeing of the american people because they are multinational corporations now we want to make sure our people maintain their rights that we keep being the leaders of innovation and that we are able to outcompete the world and not just take all of our jobs overseas and give them to cheap labor we want to make sure that americans benefit because this is what america is all about it is where the little guy has the same rights legally and they are protected that is what this fight is all about when it comes to h r 9 people need to talk to their congressmen and the congressmen need to talk to each other about what this is really all about it is easy to yawn when someone says i am going to discuss patent rights oh yeah patent law how boring it is not boring it is going to make all the difference as to whether our country stays safe because we have to have the technological edge to be safe in the world we are getting into now our people are not going to have decent housing or a decent standard of living because the wealth that is produced isnt produced just by hard work it is produced by technological efficiency and we have to be on the cut ting edge or we will be outcompeted by people overseas this is going to determine what america is going to be like i would ask

support the underlying goal of ensuring that american law enforcement agencies share information on potential child sex offenders with foreign law enforcement agencies i am opposed to how one particular provision added in the senate amendment before us today would work in practice other existing provisions of the bill already contain the following informationsharing requirements with and among law enforcement agencies here in the united states and abroad unitedstates sex offenders are required to provide international travelrelated information to the sex offender registries the department of homeland security is required to create the angel watch center to receive information on individuals seeking to enter the unitedstates who have committed offenses of a sexual nature as well as registered sex offenders seeking to travel outside the unitedstates in order to share all relevant information to federal state and local law enforcement officials the unitedstates marshals service is required to notify law enforcement agencies of sex offenders seeking to leave the united states who have not transmitted their travel information to sex offender registries the unitedstates marshals service is required to notify the international destination country of a sex offenders upcoming travel and the secretary of state should seek reciprocal international agreements or arrangements to further these goals if our goal is to ensure that customs and border as well as law enforcement officials are notified so that they may track and investigate those sex offenders who may be engaging in sex tourism or pose a threat of absconding these provisions have addressed those concerns as a result i am skeptical of what more we stand to gain by the senate amendments provision authorizing the secretary of state to use a unique passport identifier for covered sex offenders that is defined as any visual designation affixed to a conspicuous location on the passport indicating the individual is a covered sex offender at best if this vague language is meant to describe some sort of code or symbol embedded in the passport that is only discernible by law enforcement at the border indicating that the traveler is a sex offender it is redundant given the other informationsharing mandated by the bills other provisions however if this is interpreted to mean something akin to the words sex offender stamped on the identification page of the passport this raises serious problems and will lead to unintended consequences first it is simply bad policy to single out one category of offenses for this type of treatment we do not subject those who murder who defraud the government or our fellow citizens of millions and billions or who commit acts of terrorism to these restrictions second by treating all sexual offenders as one monolithic group ignores reality while some pose a continued and real risk of reoffending and may be traveling to engage in sex tourism or other illicit acts not all pose the same risk indeed the failure of this provision to allow for the individualized consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the travelers criminal history including how much time has elapsed since his last offense underscores how this provision is overbroad details such as whether the traveler is a serial child rapist versus someone with a decadesold conviction from when he was 19yearsold and his girlfriend was 14 just missing the romeo and juliet exception by one year are significant and would allow law enforcement to more appropriately prioritize their finite resources third a traveler does not have any recourse with the foreign destination country if he or she is refused entry solely on the basis of this unique passport identifier while the bill has some due process provisions those apply only domestically there is no recourse if a traveler is erroneously denied entry from the destination country fourth if the unique passport identifier is implemented in a way that makes it obvious to not only law enforcement officials but any member of the general public viewing the passport this could lead to unintended consequences of persecution and harm to the traveler this is especially troubling given that no factual context about the offense is provided if our goal is to ensure that domestic and foreign law enforcement and customs officials are notified of potential threats multiple existing provisions of the bill already achieve that goal without raising these problematic implementation and fairness concerns in summary while i support the underlying goal of ensuring that american law enforcement agencies share information on potential child sex offenders with foreign law enforcement

dynamic that is in play that is what happened here and that is what brings us to the floor today this bill represents a balanced and thoughtful compromise that makes longneeded improvements to an outdated and ineffective law the legislation before us is supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders that ranges from environmental and public health groups to large and small industrial organizations it has the support of the national association of manufacturers the chamber of commerce the american cleaning institute the national association of chemical distributors the society of chemical manufacturers affiliates and the american chemistry council there is a list of 143 different groups that have come out in support of this bill it is worthy of our support as well i want to thank the staff who worked very hard to get us here today chris sarley in my office dave mccarthy jerry couri tina richards our head chief of staff of the committee gary andres along with of course chairman fred upton who allowed all of these people to be at our disposal to get this work done we have with us in the chamber legislative counsel these are the unknown heroes the people who actually get the late phone calls who try to help us figure out the language that we are trying to work with tim brown and kakuti lin are here they have my gratitude and my thanks in an era when we kind of question federal employees and their commitment to excellence and work ethic they are good examples of what people really do many times thank you very much for your work i also want to give a nod to the great work done by the house democratic staff you are loyal adversaries and i believe we will continue to be so but we were able to do well in this process i thank the senate republicans on"],

truth is the bill is going somewhere this bill is going to move off this floor and move into the senate it is time for the senate to show some action it is time for the two bodies to actually do what they are supposed to do and work together to find a solution for california to do nothing is criminal to do nothing will put farms out of business will create much higher unemployment than seen anywhere else in the country and will devastate a food supply that feeds the rest of the nation and much of the world now this amendment in particular has some problems in conversations with the bureau of reclamation they have not asked for this project and they have no money identified for the project i am unaware of the state of californias position as well fish screens are hugely expensive projects they are subject to destruction under high flow events due to debris and restrict recreation i am concerned that this project is not even feasible what this project aims to do is make sure that water is not transferred south of the delta what many of my friends forget is as i represent san joaquin county mountain house a communitynot just farmlandthat gets a zero allocation is south of the delta it actually exports water so does tracy manteca ripon escalon areas in san joaquin that i represent that are south of the delta this is not an us against them fight this is a fight for the survival of california and it is not just about an emergency transfer of water it is about the future of california do we want to have enough water for all of our residents do we want our number one industry agriculture to be a vibrant industry we have the opportunity to have greater storage and we ought to have some commonsense solutions in the process you talk about wanting to save fish why not get rid of the predator fish or at least go out and harvest some of them so they are not eating 98 percent of the fish that you say you are trying to help there are commonsense solutions in here that will allow us to have greater flexibility greater storage and a better plan for the future of california we should not be wasting water and just allowing freshwater to get pushed arbitrarily out to the ocean this is sound environmental policy that will help us in the future and gives us a negotiating point with the senate republicans and democrats actually working together for a solution that

and this is president obama when mr obama was running for president he stated what the right policy what his policy would be to deal with the cuban tyranny he said my policy towards cuba will be guided by one word libertadfreedom and the road to freedom for all cubans must begin with justice for cubas political prisoners the right of free speech a free press freedom assembly and it must lead
