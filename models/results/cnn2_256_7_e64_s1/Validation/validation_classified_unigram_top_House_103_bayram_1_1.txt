floor the epa and others who have examined this issue have told us there are only two ways to protect nonsmokers from the hazards of breathing secondhand smoke either indoor smoking must be banned or it must be limited to separately ventilated smoking areas separate smoking sections that are not separately ventilated are not acceptable because the smoke recirculates through the buildings ventilation system directly into the rooms used by nonsmokers h r 881 does not require that agencies establish separately ventilated smoking rooms nor does it provide funding for such rooms however it leaves open the possibility of separate ventilation in cases where separate vntilation could be accomplished without significant cost of course the simplest and least expansive way to protect people

convention which effective february 20 1994 banned the dumping of radioactive waste at sea currently the ocean dumping of radioactive waste is regulated under the ocean dumping act the oda allows dumping of radioactive waste only after congress has passed a joint resolution authorizing the dumping although this provision has been in force since 1985 congress has yet to authorize any radioactive dumping for decades unitedstates law on ocean pollution has been more stringent than international law at the time of enactment the radioactive dumping provisions in oda were among the most restrictive in the world going well beyond international treaty obligations that is no longer the case the ocean radioactive dumping ban act corrects this by eliminating odas current arduous permitting process and i h 1243 replacing it with a simple ban it ensures that the united states retains its leadership position in protecting the worlds marine environment the relevance of the united states banning radioactive dumping is far reaching historically the united states has set international policy on ocean dumping of radioactive waste until last year the united states had resisted an international ban through the united states influence the issue was left unresolved that all changed last november when the clinton administration reversed the united states policy and announced its support for a ban the reversal which was brought on in part by heavy lobbying from the global legislators organization for a balanced environment enabled the international community to amend the london convention to ban the ocean dumping of nuclear waste as the ranking republican on the oceanography gulf of mexico and outer continental shelf subcommittee and the newly appointed chairman of the globe ocean protection working group i have spend the last year working to eliminate radioactive contamination of the sea on september 30 1993 at my request the oceanography subcommittee held a hearing on the threat of contamination from the russian dumping of nuclear waste for four decades the former soviet union and now the russian republic has been dumping nuclear waste from nuclear submarines and weapons plants into the worlds oceans the information gathered by the subcommittee was sobering the wests first concrete evidence about the dumping came last sumtumer following the release of the yablokov report which was commissioned by president boris yeltsin to detail the extent of soviet nuclear disposal at sea according to the report the soviet union had dumped over 2 5 million curies of radioactive waste into the arctic ocean and other marine environments by comparison the accident at three mile island in my home state of pennsylvania released 15 curies of radiation during the hearing the subcommittee discovered that since 1959 the former soviet union dumped 18 nuclear reactors a reactor screen 11 000 to 17 000 cannisters of nuclear waste and hundreds of thousands of gallon of liquid radioactive waste it also learned that solid nuclear fuel waste totaling 10 million curies is currently stored aboard vessels in murmansk harbor even after the fall of communism moscow has continued to dispose of radioactive waste at sea in october 1993 russia dumped 900 tons of lowlevel radioactive waste in the sea of japan in violation of a previously agreed upon international moratorium according to japanese press accounts high ranking russian officials have admitted that ocean dumping is likely to persist arch 10 1994 the russian pederalk actions f1llowing the october dumping have onv reinforced these fears russia was an of only five nations to abstaia from voting to approve the london convention radioactive dumping ban it ns vember 1993 then just last month it became the only nation to declare its intent not to complw with the new international ban on dumping hopefully with pressure fom the united states the russian federation can be convinced to change it policy with ten mllion curies of radiation stored aboard ships in murmansa marbor and awaiting disspoal the risk to the marina environment is significant if we fall clearly the worlds oceana shoul not be used as nuclear disposal sites before the united states can pressure russia to comply with international law we must set a strong example ourselves we must pass mr 3982 and ban this

department of justice through its handling of the knox case gave pornographers a helping hand by making it harder to convict someone on child pornography charges rather than fighting on the grounds of the tough standards which had already won numerous convictions the justice department incredibly requested that the case be sent back to a lower court to be tried under a looser standard its record on

did not even need the 6 000 additional border patrol agents that the house had already passed overwhelmingly tell that to california to florida to texas and to every local government that is

ignored the will of this congress when it has come to allowing hivinfected individuals to enter the united states legally last year congress overwhelmingly passed and the president signed a resolution

beloved daughter now anyone who has diabetes or knows someone who has diabetes is aware that it is very difficult to get an insurance company who will cover them the problem is that they say well diabetes isa preexisting condition well that is true it is a preexisting condition it is something that a person with diabetes cannot change one cannot change it like they change thecolor of their hair and like my beloved daughter they have to take good care of themselves and she does she takes tremendous care of herself and what that means is she prevents much more serious disease but if she cannot get health insurance and there are many millions of diabetics who cannot she cannot have that kind of health care that is ongoing that prevents serious serious injury now there is another

theirs when my colleagues think about that childs health they know that that child needs healthy parents to take care of that child if he should need them now nobody nobody should be forced to choose between their childs health and their own as parents we always choose our children first of course we do but what a terrible choice that is and as my colleagues know it is a terrible choice

are paying doubly because we are paying very high costs but we are also paying for very bad health care now i looked at the district that i represent that i am so proud to represent there are 11 000

outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition in addition the ftc will be allowed to proceed with a rulemaking using the unfairness standard only if the agency has reason to believe that the act or practice is prevalent moreover prevalence will now be a statutorily defined term with specific criteria for the ftc to meet taken as a whole these new criteria defining the unfairness standard should provide a strong bulwark against potential abuses of the unfairness standard by an overzealous ftca phenomenon we last observed in the late 1970s se0ting up clear guideposts for the ftc in its policy toward advertising is also fully consistent with the approach taken by the supreme court in the last few years the court has clearly begun to emphasize the first amendment protections that attach to commercial speech while these protections are clearly less stringent than those governing traditional political expression they both inform and limit the degree to which congress may restrain commercial speech i am very pleased that the ftc authorization contained in this conference report is fully consonant with the courts recent decisions in this field the major improvements to the ftc act made in this legislation would not have been possible without much hard work and diligent cooperation between the house energy and commerce committee and the senate commerce committee i commend the leadership and members of both committees in addition we benefited from the helpful advice and input of the ftc itself from other state and federal agencies from consumer groups and from the affected industriesparticularly the advertising industry and the food and beverage industries this legislation represents a real breakthrough that resulted from true bipartisan cooperation it is vitally important that an agency with important consumer protection responsibilities like the ftc be given a current charter by the congress we also need to remember that in addition to its consumer protection functions the ftc also has important antitrust responsibilities and administers other laws dealing with consumer credit against this background i am exceptionally pleased to support the approval of this conference report i have no fuither requests for time and i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0024048686027526855, 0.4975951313972473, 1, "i am happy to engage in a conversation with the gentleman i think that is one of the most awful things about our present system that for people who do not have health insurance whether they are rich or poor or whomever they tend not to go to the doctor they wait and walt until they cannot stand it and then they go to the emergency room because they have no way to pay for it they do not want to go through the hassle and they wait until they cannot handle it what that leads to is thousands of people that we treat for strokes who if they had had preventive care or had health insurance could have had their blood pressure monitored or we have young women who arrive in the emergency room about to deliver a baby who have never seen a doctor before and we wind up with young babies of low birth weight that we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on if we had spent a few dollars in prenatal care we could have helped them so one of the most important things i think about a national plan is giving access to people in the inner city and care at the early part of an illness or an injury we spend tremendous amounts of money in the emergency room dealing with the after effects of problems that could have been dealt with with a little bit of money in the very beginning and i think that is the primary thing that i see as a benefit to the inner cities it will raise the level of help this countrys infant mortality rate is an absolute dtsgrace there are countries in central america that have a better infant mortality rate than this country and there is no excuse for that we have the best health care available in the world and yet our infant mortality rate is terrible that is primarily because we are not dealing with people at the early part of a pregnancy having a baby which is not an illness but a natural human process but also other things that we could be dealing with where we ought to be dealing with early but we wait and wait and we are paying way more than we should be in this country because we walt"]]}
