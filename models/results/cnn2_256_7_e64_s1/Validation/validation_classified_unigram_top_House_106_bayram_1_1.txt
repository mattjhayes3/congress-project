families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the

districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that we go further than the education flexibility act right now there is far too much red tape and far too many regulations in hundreds of different areas generated from the federal government that does not really help our local schools but only ties them in knots i do not want the people working in the schools in my community to spend all of their time filling out forms and justifying their existence to the federal government i want them to be educating the children there and doing the job that really matters right now far too often they are filling out the forms and trying to qualify for the money and continually justifying what they axe doing we need to change that we need to shift to local control from one end of this country to the other exciting things are going on in states and school districts they are making the reforms necessary they are moving towards accountability and right now the federal government is too big of a noose stopping them from making progress on that we need to make changes like the education flexibility act as a democrat i have always been a strong supporter of education and i support my fellow democrats in supporting spending the money necessary to help with education and supporting public education public education is responsible for over 90 percent of the children in this country getting educated it needs our support but we cannot simply spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best how to do it we need to make those changes so that we can have the world class public education system we need the education flexibility act that we introduce this week as i mentioned primarily sponsored by the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from delaware is a critical step i urge all of my colleagues to support edflex pass it as soon as possible and then go further to encourage the flexibility and

cosponsor of this bill this is a tax whose time has come and it is time to be repealed it was started over 100 years ago during the spanishamerican war to raise revenues and it was started as in effect a luxury tax when only 2 percent of americans had telephone service i can remember as a boy some years ago being at my grandparents place up in east texas and they still used a party line and people did not have many phones well today about 97 percent of americans have phone service in their home or they have cellular service and also now with the rise in the use of the internet people are being taxed there i think it is a little bit more simplistic than our colleague the chairman of the committee on rules pointed out that somehow this is going to leverage an increasing boom in the hightech market but i think it is very important that this is one of the first tax breaks that we have seen come to the floor that is not a targeted tax break in one direction or does not just benefit the top 2 percent of the people with higher income this is going to benefit the broad majority of american citizens out there since most americans have some form of telephone service some are on the

my colleague from new york i think he raises a very important issue and his approach may well do more in trying to deal with the digital divide but underlying all of this it is time that we repeal this tax and put some money back in the pockets of working americans and send this tax back to where it goes we have dealt with the deficit we are not in a period of war and so it is time that we do

think a major issue for the rest of this year and well into the presidential elections next year and that is a national debate on who lost russia what caused the current economic and political instability that is occurring in that nation that still possesses a vast supply of nuclear material weapons weapons of mass destruction and pose a significant security threat to america before i talk about russia and present some perspectives i would like to first of all commend the congress members on both sides of the aisle for the passage today of the final conference report on the defense authorization bill this bill which passed the house with an overwhelming margin is a tribute to the gentleman from south carolina and the gentleman from missouri the two leaders on defense issues in this congress and to all the members who worked hard on giving our military the best possible support in terms of resources to meet the challenges and threats of the 21st century i am concerned that the bill does not have enough in the way of resources to meet the level of deployments that have been entered into by this administration and by the president in fact the level of deployments over the past 7 years are now at 33 and that in fact compares to 10 deployments in the previous 40 years from world war ii until we cannot continue to have our troops stationed around the world involved in harms way in every possible place from the balkans and kosovo to macedonia and somalia and central america and now perhaps east timor and provide less resources to pay for all these deployments that has been our big problem over the past several years so while this bill does not address all of our needs it certainly is the best possible legislation that we can come up with given the amount of dollars that the administration made available and the amount that we in the congress were able to plus up above the presidents request i would hope the president would sign this bill into law as quickly as possible there was some lastminute controversy raised because of provisions dealing with changes in the management of our department of energyrun laboratories but i can say this that those changes are needed they are important and they are critical we could not have passed doe reform legislation in my mind that the president would have signed had it been in a freestanding bill and therefore including it as a part of our defense authorization bill was extremely important the second issue i would discuss briefly is an announcement that is going to be made tomorrow by the administration regarding a change in the policy over encryption encryption is the technology that we use in the information age to protect and secure transmissions of data up until this point in time we have had strict limitations on the type and capability of encrypted software that we allow our companies to sell overseas the reason is that we do not want terrorist groups in rogue states to be able to get the capability to classify their communications so that our national security agency and intelligence community cannot get into the kinds of transmissions involving illegal activities and drug sales and arms transfers that is so important to our security for the past several years it hasbeen a stalemate many of the software companies have been pushing very hard to pass legislation to remove all limitations on being able to sell encryption software abroad at any bit strength any capability many of us in the congress who are concerned about security issues and members of the permanent select committee on intelligence on both sides of the aisle have raised our voices and have said we cannot just in one fell swoop wipe away the controls that allow us to maintain the kind of access to secure systems that allow america to protect our troops abroad as well as our homeland here in fact in each of the last two sessions of congress i have offered successfully amendments in the subcommittee on defense to the encryption bill overwhelmingly supported by democrats and republicans to slow down this process and to force us to look at the security concerns we have said during our opportunities to amend this bill both last year and most recently in july or august this past summer that we were looking for a compromise that we were looking for a way that we in fact could allow our companies to maintain their market share worldwide but also at the same time provide mechanisms for the national security agency and the intelligence community to make sure that they were being consulted when this technology was being sold in a meeting i had with deputy secretary of defense john hamre just 1 hour ago in my office he told me that tomorrow the administration will be announcing what i think will be a successful compromise that will allow industry to be happy but will allow those of us who have security concerns to be happy that we are in fact not giving away capability to our adversaries that may come back to haunt us this compromise which has yet to be worked out in terms of legislative language will do three things it will allow a process to be kept in place to make sure that our intelligence and defense community have a process before an application is granted for an encrypted software to be sold overseas above the 64bit strength capability this gives our technical people the ability to monitor the kind of software encryption that we are selling so that they understand the implications of the sale secondarily the companies will certify the end user of this encrypted algorithm software so that we know where the encryption is going to make sure it is not going near the hands of a terrorist group or perhaps a nation that is a direct opponent of the unitedstates thus could cause security problems for us the third provision would allow the defense department and the administration and intelligence community to oppose the sale of this more capable encryption to a nation or to an entity that we feel would pose a security threat to america based on these three conditions the administration and dr hamre are going to announce this change tomorrow and i am convinced that this change would not have occurred were it not for the efforts of members of the national security committee and permanent select committee on intelligences who stood up and cast very difficult votes the intense lobbying campaign by the private software companies who have significant pacs and who were having a significant influence on republican and democrat members brought tremendous pressure to bear on many members who wanted to make sure that our security was not being jeopardized in last years vote in the house subcommittee on defense and last years permanent select committee on intelligence and in this years votes in the house subcommittee on defense and permanent select committee on intelligences democrats and republicans stood together they said that we want to make sure in spite of the tremendous pressure by these software companies that we give every possible consideration to our security concerns those security concerns apparently are now being met tomorrow we will hear the outline of the specifics from the administration i have offered my support to dr hamre to work to develop bipartisan legislation to amend the safe act the goodlatte bill
