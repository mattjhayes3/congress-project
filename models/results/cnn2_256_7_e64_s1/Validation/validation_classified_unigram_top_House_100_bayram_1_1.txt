other parts of the country some religious organizations and other organizations are giving out information and condoms telling people that there is such a thing as safe sex the fact of the matter is that the aids virus the aids epidemic that we are facing right now in this country and around the world does not give us much latitude there is no such thing outside a monogomous relationship such as safe sex any longer any young person any married person any old person who involves themselves with another person that they do not have a lifelong experience with runs the risk of getting aids it is like playing russian roulette there has been a lot of information given out by the media by the surgeon general and others regarding the aids virus in fact the surgeon general and others have advocated the use of condoms as a step toward controlling the aids virus the fact of the matter is there is no foolproof method i said earlier today there are approximately 240 million aids viruses that can fit on a period at the end of a sentence so if you have contact with someone who has that aids virus you run the risk of getting it no matter what preventative measure you may employ i am not the only one who is saying this in fact i have gleaned the information i have from a number of sources i would like to read to you a letter that i received from dr robertson who is with the research and development corp in lexington ga he has done extensive research on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and i think everybody in america ought to know about this so that there is no misinformation o 1350 as we gain more information as time goes by it is going to be important that we take the steps that are necessary to protect the vast majority of the population from this epidemic this dread disease dr bowen the head of hhs said not long ago in a speech that tens of millions of people are going to die from aids the way it is going it could be more than that it is the worst plague to hit the world since the black plague and it may be the worst ever it is estimated right now that 4 million people in the united states alone have the virus within their systems it is doubling every 8 to 12 months which means that the attitudes of the american people do not change rapidly so next year there will be 4 to 8 million the following year there will be 8 to 16 million and the year after that there will be 16 to 32 million who are infected with the disease or who at least have the virus within their systems and so on there have been articles written saying that sometime within 12 years onefourth of the unitedstates population would have the virus within their systems and that may be conservative i would like to read this letter now it gets a little technical but i think most people if they will listen closely will glean from this letter what it really means the text of the letter is as follows dear mr burton i am writing in response to your telephone call today when you asked whether there might be a risk of transmission of the aids virus hivi other than by sexual intercourse homosexual acts the use of blood or blood products or during pregnancy and birth the answer to this question is yes the most pressing problem is that we cannot measure the risk though we can set some limits i will expand my answer in two waysfirst by telling you why one must be cautious in reaching any conclusions about the disease or its transmission and second by telling you why there is cause for concern about transmission by the nontraditional routes the most important source of information is the tabulation of aids cases reported to the centers for disease control these reports must be interpreted carefully since they represent disease diagnosed a long time after infection with hiv since there is no mechanism for collecting or reporting information about the development of antibodies to hiv or knowledge of infection and its routes is limited for example the majority of those coming down with aids male homosexuals in california drug addicts in new york come from the population first infected in this country but their proportions in the epidemic do not represent the proportions in the same groups infected now in contrast recent army data show that in some parts of new york there is an equal rate of infection amongst male and female applicants this will be reflected in aids cases reported in several years time these delays led many people to assume that aids would remain a disease exclusively a largely of homosexuals heterosexual spread of hiv in the united states has only recently been generally accepted with the publication of clear case reports although the epidemiological evidence has been strong for some time there have always been cases which could not be classifed into the known risk groups these represent a roughly constant 3 of the total when other categories of risk e g consorting with a prostitute are excluded this is not to say that these 3 acquired the virus casually but it does say that the unknown category is increasing roughly in step with the epidemic as a whole obviously there could be several explanations for this none of which can be excluded without considerable further study in particular if casual transmission were possible it would be difficult to prove without largescale prospective studies of the risks of associating with infected individuals studies to date are too small to exclude a risk though they may set limits on it indeed some appear to demonstrate a risk but again they are too small for us to be sure in this context it is important to remember that it is only recently that it has become clear that the risk of heterosexual transmission is roughly equal to the risk of homosexual transmission as is the risk of transmission from man to woman and from woman to man the early apparent differences in the risk of transmission by these routes appear to be accounted for by the delays in infection spreading to each group they are not real differences thus if transmission by nontraditional methods is either possible or likely it is only now with the virus quite widespread that we are likely to obtain good epidemiological evidence as was true for the traditional routes of transmission the first acceptable evidence of nontraditional transmission will come from case reports in which all other routes have been eliminated it is disturbing that we do in fact have several such cases reports these include transmission without sexual intercourse between an elderly couple whose only intimate contact was kissing transmission from a nursing mother to her child possibly in breast milk transmission between two young brothers by an unknown route and transmission between a patient and a neighbor who was nursing him it is likely that case reports of this kind will become more frequent as the general population becomes more heavily infected with the virus on the other hand without knowledge of the prevalence of seropositivitythat is of the number of infectious peoplein an environment it will be hard to detect transmission in say the workplace until the virus is quite prevalent as it will be in several years unless transmission is reduced now here we must for the moment rely on our theoretical knowledge of hiv and similar viruses as well as on what information we can glean from the case reports to hand hiv belongs to the family of retroviruses and the subfamily lentivlrinae the lentviruses are known to infect ungulates and primates by several routes including aerosols and even hiv has apparently spread from one chimpanzee to its cagemate without sexual contact in addition all the lentiviruses evolve rapidly so that their envelope proteins which contain the sites that recognise and blind to receptors on the cells they infect are very variable leading to the possibility of variation in infectiousness as is found in hiv as well as in specificity which might also lead to a variation in the efficiency of different routes of infection it is prudent therefore to assume that hiv can share these properties since it is extremely closely related to the other lentiviruses particularly in view of the fact that hiv can be found in most bodily secretions and excretions including urine tears and saliva as well as breast milk blood and semen hiv is also much tougher than had been thought being capable of surviving with undiminished infectiousness for at least two weeks at room temperature if damp there are therefore strong theoretical grounds for caution these grounds supply a possible february 19 1 987 basis for the transmission of the virus in those cases of nontraditional infection already reported and are cause for growing caution as the virus becomes more prevalent leading to an increasing number of contacts with infected people in the traditional modes of transmission it appears to be the case that risk per exposure is constant with infection becoming increasingly likely with an increasing number of exposures the analogy between the transmission of hepatitisb and aids has often been drawn the cdc recommend that hepatitisb precautions be taken to minimize the spread of hiv in the health care setting it seems that the routes of transmission are very similar but that the hepatitisb virus is more infectious than hiv in other words it is reasonable to expect that more cases of hiv transmission between household members will occur as prolonged exposure to hiv carriers becomes more common it will be much more difficult to detect transmission by these means outside the household without welldesigned prospective epidemlological studies the studies reported to date have been too limited to allow any conclusion other than that casual transmission is probably not easy we should remember however that this was said at first for heterosexual transmission of the virus though now we know that it is easy indeed the case reports we have are extremely strong evidence of transmission within the household and cannot be rebutted by the limited epidemlological studies of household transmission even amongst trained healthcare personnel there are cases of transmission that cannot be accounted for by riskgroup membership again all we can say is that transmission in the healthcare setting is not very likely at the moment we cannot say that it is impossible in an attachment to this letter i list the main points and give references to the most important papers copies of which are also attached my considered opinion is that transmission by contact within the family happens and that casual transmission is possible but that we have too few data to determine how efficient each casual route is some routes of transmission are not likely at all for example it does not seem possible for enough virus to be transmitted by mosquito though it is possible that other insect vectors in warm climates could play a role we simply have no direct evidence of insect transmission and what evidence we have suggests that if it plays a role at all in the tropics it is a very limited one transmission by coughing or sneezing is clearly possible in theory but does not yet seem to be likely if it were likely then we would expect to see a fillingin of the age distribution of those infected with the virus this could be happening since we have little information about the prevalence of infection by age group but if it is it has not yet affected the agedistribution of aids cases in the united states again this tells us the population at large the traditional routes are more efficient transmitters than the casual routes however i believe that there are more serious issues than the question of casual transmission one statistic illustrates this well it is likely that at least 4 million americans are infected by the virus we will not know the true number unless we perform widespread blood testing or until those infected begin to develop aids study of relatively small groups here and abroad shows that infection spreads rapidly through a population saturating it in about 58 years very roughly there is a doubling time for prevalence of infection of no more than a year if we accept this conservative estimate then there will be 4 million new infections in the united states in 1987 this is a daily rate of over 10 000 and just exceeds the annual number of live births in the united states even if only 2 million are now infected this statistic will be true in a years time if more are in fact infected now then we are already exceeding the number of live births with the number of new hiv infections since we now know that at least 50 of those infected will develop aids and then die and in fact have no reason to assume that this will not be the case for all or nearly all of those infected the situation is already extremely grave this is particularly true because what evidence we have suggests that no actions taken to date have had any measurable effect on the spread of the epidemic and because actions that are likely to be taken in the near future depend solely on changes in behavior in people who do not even know that they are infected with hiv and do not consider themselves at risk such behavioral change has not occurred in the past under these or any other circumstances without regulatory force to back it up the prognosis is therefore grim and relatively little time is left if we are to have any hope of controlling the epidemic in the united states we certainly cannot afford to wait for an hypothetical cure of the development of a vaccine yours sincerely"], [0.0012260079383850098, 0.998773992061615, 1, "i rise in support of h r 4844 the federal

of pilots and aircraft ownership to facilitate investigations of and legal actions against drug smugglers when drug enforcement authorities learn that a particular aircraft is being used in drug smuggling activities it is sometimes difficult or impossible to discover the identity of the true owners the difficulty is cause by the ease with which the faas aircraft registration and pilot certification requirements can be circumvented by smugglers in addition there are some significant holes in the faas system of registering aircraft and pilots even when a pilot or owner is acting in

of antitank weapons the number of mercenaries the number of officers that are available we have not had an answer he said to this proposal ten days on the offer has gotten lost he said apparently in

interesting meeting do you not think to have weinberger sit down and talk with a soviet adversary we all thought that would have been a very interesting meeting not possibly as interesting as the haglerleonard fight but certainly in that realm shevardnadze then said you have been saying republicans are difficult looking at cheney he said or cheney then decided to defend grenada in some detail shevardnadze said look shall we open a debate on that subject look at the number of unitedstates forces deployed around the world look at how the ussr is encircled by bases and foreign troops look at turkey look at all the other regions and continents he said the fact that you do not have troops in grenada does not make it any easier for us gorbachev has proposed no troops on any other countrys

we had gone on too long cheney suggested that we had a 5minute rule in the congress and he said oh yes we have this 5minute rule as well in the board of foreign experts five minutes for everyone but me i have as much time as i want then speaker wright went into some length about the issues that we had discussed before about salt and about other things he also raised the question of the timetable for afghanistan shevardnadze responded he said we did not test nuclear weapons for 18 months he agreed that this is not a lost effort he said sooner or later we will all come to this position nuclear weapons should not spread to the whole world basically he said that he is in agreement and i know the position of the unitedstates congress on this and i know we act in a common way as to the number of limits we propose something more there are negotiations going on in geneva and at the salt limits we should keep to the salt limits and we welcome the congresss pronouncements on this on afghanistan he referred to the fact that there had already been a time frame that this had been discussed in geneva he also said that the process of national reconciliation is taking place in afghanistan and then he said something really interesting which we assume he said frankly speaking we cannot have a civil war right after we leave internally there is an interesting process going on and we should encourage that dialog we should not encourage the extremists and he said you know what i mean i did not but maybe someone else did i was in vietnam i saw what happened to your troops there he said this with some sadness miccx leland then elaborated on his proposal for a joint food lift to africa and shevardnadze said this is a very good proposal we will have serious negotiations at any level on this as for practical advantages and problems we will work this out through our embassy it is a shame he said very wistfully the problem is not just in mozambique where the airlift would occur it is also in ethiopia and there we had some spontaneous cooperation and he said that we should build on this he said the global problem of hunger is related to the arms race and you know how much we spend on arms we believe in the party that we must stop and we must set an example for developing countries to stop the spread of the arms race in order to respond to hunger it is

willingto pay a reasonable fee for satellitetransmitted programming they recognized that they were receiving a service for which cable subscribers were paying as programmers began to scramble concerns turned to the availability and cost of decoders many believed that the costs to subscribe to these services would be significantly higher than those paid by subscribers in areas where cable service is available without dishes in fairness i think its important to realize that some of these concerns are being addressed decoders for instance which were not in ample supply initially now are being built into the dish lease and purchase plans are available for existing dishowners cable companies claim that the rates for packages for dishowners are now being offered at a rate less than is charged cable

certify it and then he is free of any restriction maybe it is the reductio ad absurdum by the other side that indicates the poverty of this argument i rise in support of the amendment the

400 united states business affiliates of canadian companies employ over 527 000 workers in the united states these statistics demonstrate the vast potential for economic expansion and growth under this historic agreement in addition to the expected gains from the elimination of all tariffs over a 10year period provisions of the agreement in nontariff areas such as energy government procurement services investments and intellectual property rights will provide the bedrock for longterm mutual benefits expanded twoway trade and investment can create millions of new jobs increase opportunities for both canadians and americans and greatly enhance the prosperity of both nations we can look at the example of other existing free trade areas to get an indication of the potential benefits of this agreement covering much larger economies the creation of the european economic community affords the most appropriate example from 1959 to 1969 the period when all ec tariffs were eliminated trade within the ec rose 347 percent about three times higher than outside the ec after great britain entered the ec in 1973 its exports to other member states grew by 28 percent per year for a 10year period imports from ec partners rose by 24 percent both spain and portugal have shown even greater trade expansion since their recent entry into the ec also twoway trade between australia and new zealand has nearly doubled since 1983 when they reached an accord liberalizing trade between them former secretary of the treasury james baker who was instrumental in finalizing the negotiations between our two countries has called the agreement truly a winwin enterprise by opening markets and establishing rules of fair play across a wide range of economic activity we can achieve better prices for consumers and businesses and create major commercial and investment opportunities he went on to say that the agreement reaffirms that the united states and canada are not only geographic neighbors but most special economic neighbors as well the successful conclusion of this agreement with its wideranging provisions supports his words in addition to the reduction of tariffs already mentioned the united statescanada agreement provides numerous improvements in the nontariff area for example the agreement establishes detailed rules of origin designed to properly identify those products of canadian and united states manufacture although necessary to ensure that the benefits of the pact are not extended to noncontributing countries the new definitions of origin signal a more effective method of determining such rules amorg all trading partners similarly the new disputesettlement procedures worked out between canada and the united states hopefully will result in more effective and more timely resolutions to trade disputes that can be translated to the multilateral process it remains for the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations now underway in geneva to take full advantage of the example the united states and canada have set in this and many other areas although the gatt is still arguing over what can be properly addressed by that international body this bilateral agreement has boldly addressed sectors of growing trade importance such as services traderelated investment and intellectual property rights furthermore the agreement provides secure fair access to canadian energy supplies even in times of shortage removes virtually all existing discrimination by canada against united states financial institutions as well as significantly liberalizing canadas foreign investment regime improves the rules under which bilateral auto trade is conducted limits agriculture and other subsidies removes meat import quotas improves mutual procedures for setting technical standards and enhances the applications when speaking before the canadian parliament last year president reagan referred to the open border between our two countries as a border that stands as a demonstration of more than a century and a half of friendship a border that has been called a lesson of peace to all nations president reagan celebrated the border as a concrete living lesson that the path to peace is freedom that the relations of free peoplesno matter how different no matter how distinct their national charactersthose relations will be marked by

each other very well but we have had a very friendly relationship and i have benefited from his being here because i have always valued his knowledge and his advice and i have always listened to his remarks on matters especially pertaining to defense and the architectural wonders of the west front and i recall we did meet one time in manila over in the philippines about 8 years igo and i learned of his service there with former general macarthur who is one of the most famous arkansans to ever come from my state i sense that i have gleaned from his experience a great deal of knowledge and information about politics of the pacific rim which is a dynamic growing area to which all of the worlds money seems to be flowing sams advice and information about the pacific has been very valuable to us i hope that the gentleman from new york will come back often and meet with us back in the cloakroom and other places to continue to be our adviser on that subject because most of us have a poverty of information in that part of the world having had little opportunity to travel there and to learn about that region it is the region of the future and one that we need to know about i say to the gentleman from new york i thank you for the contributions youve made in that regard and the general good guide that you have been during your years of service here in the halls of the house i expect it is kind of unusual sitting there listening to people that you have sen all these years finally getting up and saying something nice normally we do not get that until we leave i hope along
