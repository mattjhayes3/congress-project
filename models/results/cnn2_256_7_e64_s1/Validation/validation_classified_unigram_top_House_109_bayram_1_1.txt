more of the same continued tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by slashing programs that rhode islanders depend on however the spratt substitute contains thoughtful polities to balance the budget by 2012 without individual tax rate increases or harmful cuts to security health care education veterans benefits and other programs that improve the quality of life for rhode islands working families while the republicans claim that budget cuts are needed to return to fiscal discipline they forget their own policies caused todays financial problems without the tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of americans enacted since 2001 our nations fiscal health would be much rosier and the neediest and most vulnerable americans would not be forced to sacrifice their fiscal year 2006 budget proposal continues to move in the wrong direction and next years deficit will likely be the largest in history with at least 400 billion added to the national credit card how does this blueprint make us safer while the department of homeland security receives an overall increase in funding the budget largely follows the presidents request which cuts needed resources for the first responders who risk their lives every day to protect us the spratt substitute contains 1 1 billion more than the republican budget for vital law enforcement programs such as cops fire grants and byrne grants these programs provide rhode islands police and fire departments with the equipment and training to keep us safe how does this blueprint make us healthier the republican budget requires 20 billion in cuts to medicaid this reduction will jeopardize a critical health care safety net for seniors children and people with disabilities and shift more of the burden to states medicaid cuts would result in 80 million less for rhode island the loss of federal funding places an enormous burden on states like rhode island by pressuring them to cut eligibility for medicaid my state has successfully leveraged federal medicaid dollars and currently offers coverage to many vulnerable lowincome pregnant women parents of young children and other groups not included in the federal mandate without medicaid these people would likely join the increasing ranks of the uninsured lacking proper preventative care these patients will be forced to go to emergency rooms leading to long waits and higher costs for everyone these cuts will also threaten programs such as rite share an employer buyin program funded in part by medicaid the republican medicaid cuts are restored in the spratt substitute how does this blueprint prepare children for the future again the republican budget matches the presidents proposal to eliminate 48 education programs that provide assistance with vocational education education technology civic education and school counselors in contrast the spratt substitute provides 4 5 billion in additional funding for no child left behind and other valuable programs such as student loans and school lunches giving students the resources to succeed how does this blueprint honor those who serve our country in uniform perhaps most egregiously during this time of war the republicans want to cut veterans health care by 14 billion over five years impose new fees and increase copayments for veterans health care adding an undue burden to those who have served their country so bravely the spratt substitute provides 17 billion over five years to provide veterans the services they have earned through their patriotism and sacrifice the republican blueprint does not make us safer or healthier prepare children for the future or honor veterans by continuing failed tax policies while cutting effective programs that rhode islanders depend on their proposal is a misguided and unjust

by the leadership we refer to it as the leadership hour and to take an opportunity to talk about things that are important to this majority are important indeed to the american people and that is what we are going to do during this hour we are going to talk about the medicare part d prescription drug benefit but i want to digress for just a minute our colleagues on the other side of the aisle just spent the better part of an hour talking about the budget during the course of that colloquy we heard the word hypocrisy used a number of times i want to address this just for a moment because the hypocrisy of course is to suggest that the tax cuts that this administration and this republican majority have enacted and just today continued those tax cuts refused to let the other side of the aisle in this body raise taxes on the american people they spent a good deal of time talking about the fact that the rich get the biggest tax break well the hypocrisy of that argument is that the rich if you call someone with an adjusted gross income of 75 000 a year rich then so be it but these are the people that are paying most of the taxes these are the people that are paying at the 39 6 marginal rate the highest rate so for them in any acrosstheboard tax cut and indeed that is exactly what this is every taxpayer saves money but those that are paying the most in taxes with an acrosstheboard cut are quite naturally on a dollar amount not a percentage amount but on a dollar amount are going to get the biggest tax break of course they are but what is that enabling them to do the small business men and women in this country who create probably 75 percent of the jobs it is to grow their businesses because of the opportunity to rapidly depreciate for capital improvements and bricks and mortar and putting in a new product line in their business to hire some of these people who today because of their unemployment are not paying any taxes it is really hard i think and i think my colleagues understand this the american people understand it it is really pretty hard to get a tax refund when you are not paying any taxes but indeed we do that too the child tax credit increasing them from 600 to 1 000 those are refundable tax credits that are going to people who indeed are not paying any taxes again as i said at the outset what we are talking about tonight has got to be one of the most important things that we have done for the american people since medicare was first passed when i was a freshman medical student in 1965 where there was a part a the hospital part a part b the doctor part but no part d the drug part for many years i am going to say probably within 5 years of the passage of that bill people were starting to wonder why we didnt have that benefit of prescription drugs when more and more of these wonder drugs whether we are talking about pharmaceuticals or antibiotics or whether we are talking about beta blockers for heart disease and high blood pressure and irregular heart rhythms whether we are talking about oral bymouth chemotherapy and we realized of course it wasnt just surgery cutting something out a diseased organ that we really need to put our emphasis on it is preventive health care and allowing people to be able to afford to get prescription drugs to lower the blood sugar to prevent the ravages of diabetes such as losing your limb or having your kidneys fail and going on renal dialysis and maybe eventually needing a kidney transplant or to treat high blood pressure a condition which for a long time has no symptoms absolutely no symptoms it is incipient we use that word a person could end up in the emergency room having already had a stroke before anybody knew that they had high blood pressure or talk about coronary artery disease which most people have in adult life and until we realized that elevated cholesterol and certain type lipids in the blood stream is what caused those plaques to form in those coronary arteries that supply blood and oxygen of course to the heart muscle when we finally realized that if we could lower cholesterol and lipids in the body that we could prevent heart disease coronary artery disease heart attacks and not have to resort to what we know of course today as bypass surgery it is such a compassionate thing to prevent these diseases rather than to treat them when people are really really in danger of sudden death or a stroke that is what this is all about that is what this republican leadership president bush has delivered to the american people a promise that other congresses have made i can assure you that work was done on this in the past but former presidents former administrations former congresses just failed to deliver and so we are very proud to stand here tonight and talk about this wonderful addition tomedicare the part d prescription drug part it is optional it is just like part b a person doesnt have to sign up for it yes it is premium based there is a monthly premium often deducted from the social security check of those who can afford it and those who cannot afford it it is not going to cost them anything the lowincome seniors who qualify for the medicare supplement on this wonderful program for them they pay no deductible they pay no monthly premium there is no gap in the coverage they have catastrophic coverage and the only cost may be 1 for a months supply of a generic drug or up to 5 for a months supply of a brand name drug there are approximately 42 7 current medicare beneficiaries in this country today and mr speaker and my colleagues i want to draw your attention to my first slide because this really shows you the success that we have had in this 6month opportunity starting november 15 through upcoming in 6 days may 15 of those almost 43 million medicare beneficiaries most of them because of age 65 possibly 5 or 6 million because of a disability at a younger agelook at this mr speaker37 million seniors now have prescription drug coverage under medicare part d 37 million now we want to get this up to 40 million in the next 6 days and that is really why i am here tonight to get this message out to let those few stragglers if you will in regard to signing up to do everything we can and we will do that back in our districts we have been doing it in fact i have been working on that talking about trying to get that message out for over 2 years when we first passed this medicare modernization prescription drug act in november of 2003 a very proud moment for this physicianmember by the way to support such a wonderful program but now we have got the latest count 37 million and that is i think a fantastic achievement in this first sign p period why is it so important well seniors if you can see on this next slide my colleagues seniors ate saving an average of 1 100 a year with medicare prescription drug coverage maybe more importantly though that is average for the 37 million that are signed up but maybe more importantly the lowincome seniors are saving an average of 3 700 a year 3 700 a year that is a lot of money in regard to that number that i just shared with my colleagues 3 700 a year for those lowincome seniors and that is why we are pushing so hard in these next 6 days of the 6 million i said 37 million have signed up out of almost 43 million of those 6 million that havent we are estimating pretty accurately that close to 3 million of those are low income they qualify for this subsidy and some of them as i say their only cost of these lifesaving prescriptions would be a 1 copay and so it is veryimportant most important that we get the word out to them in these next few days and to get them signed up because this is literally a godsend it is a nobrainer and for whatever reason maybe they have heard some of the disingenuous well downright you know they talked about the h word in their hour just a few minutes ago hypocrisy from the other side regrettably i feel that that is part of the reason why the most needy 3 million of them have missed the opportunity thus far but we are determined to get the word out to them that is the compassioriate thing to do and we are doing it proof of the pudding more than a million seniors have enrolled in medicare part d just since april i am talking about a 2week period so we are talking about almost 500 000 people have signed up just in the last 21 2 weeks so we are getting the word out and thank god our seniors are responding well how is the program working for those that may have signed up on november 15 2005 and immediately january 1 2006 started getting their prescriptions with a prescription drug benefit before that of course we know that the seniors probably the only group of patients that go to the drug store went to the drug store and had to pay sticker price they werent getting any deals and nobody negotiated any discount for them because of volume buying it was just like going to buy a new automobile and paying that price on the windshield that we refer to as sticker price most people dont have to do that but that is what the seniors were doing well really that is what some were doing a lot were just too embarrassed to even go into the drug store knowing that they couldnt afford to pay even half that amount but what has happened since january 1 over this 5month period well 90 and i want to call my colleagues attention to this next slide i know the printing is a little small but look closely because these numbers are very telling ninetyone percent of seniors say their plan is convenient to use at their pharmacy and i want to thank our pharmacists too by the way especially our independent pharmacists because a lot of times it is just them and maybe a clerk up front and yet they are spending the time to explain and i know it is at significant cost to their bottom line and i think that they are to be commended because they have helped make this program a success and we are committed to continuing to work with them i know in my district i have met just within the last 10 days with some good personal friends who are independent pharmacists and they are bringing some concerns to us there is still some heartburn on their part and i understand that and we are going to continue to work with them because of the great work that they have done for us going back to the slide 90 percent say that they know how their plan works and they know how to use it eightyfive percent say their ilan covers all the medicines they need and nearly 80 percent are happy with the amount of coverage they have and this is so important they would recommend their plan to others i dont want to miss this opportunity to say my colleagues and i am sure on both sides of the aisle you have had similar experiences my mom god bless my mom i am thinking about her of course a lot this week because of mothers day coming up on sunday but the greatest mothers day gift that i gave to her mom is 88years old i dont think she would mind me telling that because she looks like she is 68 and if it wasnt for a couple of gimpy knees she would still be out on the golf course but i sat down with mom a couple of months ago and we went through this it was a little bit time consuming maybe a little bit more confusing than i thought or she thought it would be but she is saving about 1 200 a year now and this is what we are talking about real real savings moms very happy with the program she picked her own drug store very close by her home in aiken south carolina and she didnthave to change a thing and is very pleased with the program listen to what some of the senior organizations are saying about this program today and i remember during the debate and of course we got accused of passing this bill in the dark of night i would say to my colleagues in regard to that we started the debate late in the afternoon and we were determined to get our work done so we ended up on final passage yes in the dark of night but had we started our debate in the dark of night we would have passed this bill in the bright sunshine of the afternoon that is just the way the clock works i look at my job as a 24 7 job and i am not a clockwatcher just like i wasnt when i practiced medicine and delivered babies before coming to this body people were always coming to me saying dont all babies come in the middle of the night and i said well no but it seems that way because the patient either comes in in the middle of the night and ends up delivering in the daytime or comes in in the daytime and ends up delivering in the middle of the night we delivered this baby in the middle of the night but a beautiful beautiful baby it was and is and the other side criticized that great senior organization known as the aarp of which i have been a member for started at age 50 i wont tell you how many years i dont want to tell my age because my wife says that will tell her age but they were so mad so mad that this organization aarp with 37 million seniors as part of that group had the audacity to support a republican bill look what the aarp says today with the medicare drug program more older americans than ever before have access to affordable prescription drugs the focus right now needs to be on helping people not playing politics discouraging enrollment is a disservice to the millions who could be saving money on prescription drug bills thats a quote from the president and ceo of the aarp bill novelli and i know mr novelli and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know him and know that he doesnt play politics he is just stating the facts no hypocrisy here well i am not a regular reader of the new york times maybe the washington times the new york times is not known as a bastion of conservatism but listen to what they say the medicare drug benefits success depends heavily on getting lots of healthy people to sign up so that their premium s can help subsidize medicine for the chronically ill the may 15 deadline should serve as a useful product to force fencesitters to make a decision now that is a new york times editorial april 3 2006 when we were debating we had this resolution nancy johnson the distinguished chairwoman of the health subcommittee of ways and means put forward a resolution this evening encouraging all members of this body to work hard over this next week to get people signed up but the other side continues to try to put up a fence to be obstructionist to say you know dont sign up and criticizing us for encouraging them to sign up saying that we are cruel that we are going to enact a penalty if they dont well the fact is a lot of people good people good seniors are just like this senior they have a tendency to procrastinate l 2245 if it was not for the april 15 deadline i would never get my tax return in even with that if there is an opportunity to extend it without significant penalty i am going to take that opportunity i have done that probably every year for the last 10 or so waiting until absolutely until the last minute when really i had the facts i had the information and i needed to go ahead and get that done but i just kind of put it off until the last minute that is why we have a deadline it is not to be cruel or to be coercing or forcing anybody to do anything but clearly we anticipate that because of that deadline and kind of a wakeup call to people that 1 6 million more will sign up between now and next monday that is what that is all about the new york times certainly understands that i cant understand why our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who probably most of whom read that newspaper every day it is kind of maybe sort of biblical for them they cant understand that or maybe they missed that particular article listen to what the st petersburg times said here is good news without exception every senior i saw on the way out of the gulfport senior center that is in st petersburg was happy or relieved carolyn toliver dallas texas area on aging carolyn toliver the benefits counseling coordinator at the dallas area agency on aging says she is not phased by the prospect of a lastminute surge she even admits to wishing for one i hope we are overrun she said this is a generous benefit i dont want anyone to miss out on it here again from the new york times editorial pages it says many seniors are clearly saving money on drugs purchases i quote complaints and call waiting times are diminishing and many previously uninsured patients are clearly saving money on drug purchases that was in the new york times an article entitled medicare drug challenges it was an editorial actually on april 3rd of this year the news indeed is good despite again a lot of negativism on the other side there were a number of things that were suggested when the opposition for this program was so strong but today as i pointed out at the outset 37 million have signed up listen to this breakdown because this is important too 8 9 million enrolled in the standalone prescription drug plan almost 9 million 5 9 million are enrolled some medicare advantage that is the program that used to be medicare choice but because of medicare modernization it is much much improved almost 6 million of the socalled dual eligibles those people that because of their lowincome and age were eligible not only for medicare but medicaid almost 7 million retirees are enrolled in a medicare retiree subsidy that is a supplemental plan that includes prescription drug coverage there are still people that had the option and i think is real important for us to remember that nobody is forced into medicare part d if they have got something that is just as good if not better then we have encouraged them to stay in those programs they are then of course there are 3 5 million that are covered under federal retiree coverage 1 9 million are could have had under tricare 1 6 million are covered through the federal employee health benefit plan and then 5 8 million medicare beneficiaries have some alternative source of what we referred to as credible prescription drug cov erage some examples of that would be like veterans affairs people are getting their medication they are 65 they are on medicare they are eligible part a and part b but as far as the prescription drug part they are utilizing the veterans administration"], [0.9303540587425232, 0.9303540587425232, 0, "i rise today in strong support of h r 9 the fannie lou hamer rosa parks and coretta scott king voting rights

the enforcement system treats federal firearms licensees unfairly by focusing too much on minor technical violations with threats of revocation so on the occasional though rare occasion where the gun

service that has been exhibited by our guard and reserve units throughout the country recently i had a chance to return to iraq for my third trip in country it is invaluable experience in getting a firsthand account in regards to the ongoing operations the progress that is being made what is working and perhaps more importantly what is not working the time that we were able to spend with our troops on the ground is time well spent because they do tend to tell us like it is what is working what is not what we need to improve upon in regards to the policy of what is taking place but having gone to iraq now on three separate occasions i can honestly state that nothing has made me prouder to be an american than seeing our troops in uniform there performing their duties they are so welltrained so wellmotivated they are in short the best our nation has to offer yet their service to our country would be made much more difficult if they did not receive the support from back home first and foremost from their families and loved ones who also have to endure extreme sacrifice and hardship by allowing them to serve for extended periods of time overseas typically 1 year

employers out there that have to by law a law that congress has passed allow them to serve our country while keeping their jobs open and safe back home it is one of those items that people tend not to think too much about but it does go to alleviate a lot of the concerns that our serving guard and reserve units have and that is maintaining financial security for the families back home and knowing that when they do return from serving our country there will be a position for them at their place of employment in wisconsin we have had two companies last year that were recognized for their outstanding service to the guard and reserve employees that they have one is harley davidson the other was schneider trucking located up in green bay wisconsin every year there is a process to try to

decades crop prices are low subsidies are eroding deepening digital divide the opportunities for opportunity in rural america are slim in offering the amendment i believe we could begin to meet a

water and waste grant program in the bill to 689 million an increase of 44 percent over the bill higher than any of the years since at least fiscal year 1996 these are the kinds of community

energy production consumption and infrastructure e 1345 we ought to seize this opportunity to reenergize a farm economy and at the same time jumpstart the countrys energy independence by looking at these new technologies unfortunately i believe our investment in these programs continues to be tentative lets take a look at the programs bioenergy makes available reducedprice feedstocks for expansion of ethanol and biodiesel facilities that receives no funding at all under this bill this program alone could help our farmers take those first steps towards creating a market for renewable energy the valueadded agricultural product market development grants could build more integrated ethanol biorefineries and spur development of new uses for agricultural products that does not even receive its authorized level in this bill with only 28 million despite its popularity the renewable energy systems and energy efficiencies improvement program that provides resources to farmers and rural small businesses for energy efficiency is only funded at 23 million that is half its authorized level let me just be clear these are all usda programs funded under this bill so we have a serious role to play in this committee the amendment proposes to seriously fund these programs it would increase biorefinery development grants by 50 million restore 120 millioi to the bioenergy program and fund the valueadded agricultural product market development grant program at an authorized level of 40 million in addition it doubles the funding for the renewable energy systems and the energy efficiency improvements program and the biomass research and development program while providing increased funding to finance renewable fuel filling stations in rural areas it also increases funding for the land grant universities by 25 million to look at their portion of the research which will be critical in order for us to move forward the amendment is fully paid for by asking those making more than 1 million per year to forego less than 1 500 of their 90 000plus tax cuts american families are sacrificing enough it is time this congress ask the most welloff to do their part to meet the

movement ultimately forced the king to restore sovereignty to the people of nepal on april 24 the king bowed to public pressure and announced the reinstatement of parliament on april 28 parliament convened for the first time since 2002 with g p koirala of the nepali congress party at the helm of a national unity government the kings seizure of civilian authority and disdain for the political parties leethem to seek a rapprochement with nepals maoist insurgents based on their mutual rejection of the kings royal coup this rapprochement led to a formalized 12point understanding between the partiesand the maoists the key element of which is a commitment by the parties now the government to support elections to a constituent assembly charged with drafting a new constitution a longstanding maoist demand in exchange for maoist commitment to support multiparty democracy under the comprehensive agreement reached this november the maoist rebels will join a transitional government while their weapons are to be put under u n supervision the new agreement also establishes an ambitious timetable for democratic reform with the objective of holding elections monitored by the u n to the constituent assembly by midjune 2007 the government of the united states has welcomed the announcement of this agreement the administration and congress hope this step will place nepal on a path to lasting peace and democracy all of us hope that the maoist commitment to peace and multiparty democracy is genuine and that they have irrevocably abandoned their stated goal of establishing a oneparty authoritarian state while it is always prudent to judge those who take law into their hands by their actions not their words the congress is committed to giving reconciliation approaches as a fair and reasonable chance america fully supports any peace process that safeguards the aspirations of the nepali people as the resolution suggests this means that violence and intimidation and criminal acts such as forced recruitment of cadre and extortion should cease forthwith nepali people who have lived in fear and insecurity for over a decade deserve not only a chance for peace and prosperity but to choose their own form of government through free and fair elections america is committed to helping the nepali people build a peaceful prosperous and democratic future i urge support for this

used to initiate military operations except in accordance with article i section 8 of the constitution of the united states the intent of this is simple to prevent the president from committing unitedstates forces to additional wars without first coming to congress for a vote authorizing such military action if the president wishes or feels it is necessary to have a war with syria iran north korea or any other nation then under the unitedstates constitution and my amendment he must first come to congress some will try and argue that this would tie the hands of the president and the pentagon and the cia when it comes down to tracking down al qaeda my amendment would not impact the governments ability to hunt apprehend or kill members of al qaeda on september 18 congress adopted a broad authorization of force that says the president is authorized to use all necessary appropriate force against nations organizations and persons he determines planned authorized committed aided the terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the united states by such nations organizations or persons referring back to the preceding list of countries if the president could demonstrate that any of them were involved in 9 11 he would not need further authorization from congress nor would my amendment impact on our ongoing military operations in iraq on october 16 2002 congress authorized those actions under the united states constitution further there are those who would say what about covert activities it is important to note that title 50 united states code section 413 already provides congressional authorization pursuant to amendments in 1980 to the national security act of 1947 for the president to authorize covert operations under certain circumstances on behalf of the united states h4772 co in other words if my amendment passes the president will still have all of the authorization from congress he needs to actively pursue al qaeda operations in iraq and other terrorist activities around the globe the amendment simply seeks to reinforce war powers granted solely to congress under the unitedstates constitution to ensure the president cannot launch a major war against iran syria tlorth korea or any other nation without a vote from congress some will say is that really necessary on april 18 2002 in response to a letter i and other members sent to the president about the need to authorize the war with iraq i received a letter from thenwhite house counsel alberto gonzalez now attorney general mr gonzalez stated that the president has broad constitutional authority as commanderinchief and as the sole organ of the federal government in foreign affairs to deploy the armed forces of the united states a formal declaration of war or other authorization from the congress is not required to enable the president to undertake the full range of actions that may be necessary to protect our national security that is an extraordinarily broad assertion not supported by a president after more than 200 years of interpretation of the constitution so i feel my amendment as narrow as it is is necessary to protect the war powers separation of the president as the commanderinchief the congress of the united states has the sole authority to declare war except in case of sudden attack upon the united states its citizens or armed forces ample opportunity exists for the president to continue to pursue al qaeda and others and the war in iraq under this amendment i urge my colleagues if they support that interpretation of the constitution which is broadly acknowledged by most legal scholars except mr gonzalez and i do not know if he is a legal scholar and would uphold our authority"], [0.002224445343017578, 0.4977755546569824, 0, "the defense appropriations bill which this conference report is about is also the vehicle for a number of other issues those other issues have been discussed very thoroughly during consideration of the rule so i atn going to reserve my comments strictly to the area of the defense appropriations bill this bill is to provide for the security of our nation and to appropriate the funds to pay for the equipment the training the consumable supplies but more importantly for the men and women who serve in our uniform those who make it possible for us to sleep tonight well not tonight because we are not sleeping tonight but to make it possible for americans to sleep tonight knowing that they kre secure because of these brave warriors who are prepared to protect america at any instance this bill for example includes the money for the pay raise for the members of our military the bill provides a bridge fund of 0 billion for the conduct of the global war against terror in afghanistan and iraq and other places it provides for replacing the equipment that has been destroyed or worn out dulfing the conduct of the war it provides additional funding to provide more effective ways to protect against and defend against the terrible tragic ieds it provides armor for our vehicles i am going to be brief i just want to hit some of the highlights of what the bill does i want the members to know that this appropriations bill funds the insurance and death gratuities that we have increased for the members of our military it provides basically the presidents request for a fairly aggressive shipbuilding program this is a really good defense appropriations bill it was strongly supported when it passed the house 6 months ago but because of other delays we are just now getting to vote on this final package this is a good bill and i do not think there is any controversy associated with the defense part of this conference

organizations the fire chiefs international the forest firefighters folks support this legislation because they know what it will do and how important it is the udall amendment may sound plausible may sound reasonable and it is neither the udall amendment is based on the theory that salvage increases fire risk wildfire fighting associations representing over 12 000 firefighters disagree this amendment also requires that no practice may be carried out unless the secretary certifies the practice or project will not increase fire risk or decrease forest regeneration now if you havent been involved in this discussion like we have in nine hearings and 50 drafts you would think well that sounds reasonable we wouldnt want to do anything that would increase fire risk or maybe decrease regeneration well let me give you an example of what happens in the real world imagine the following scenario logging creates logging slash under contractual agreements it must be cleaned up often within 30 days the agency could get sued because of the increased fire risk that exists during that 30day period to do a recovery after a hurricane the forest service proposes a salvage sale to capture value remove hazardous fuels and plant a mix of willow species and riparian areas and mixed conifers on the drier sites a lawsuit could be filed saying the agency hasnt proven that one seedling that survived that fire or that hurricane would be affected so otherwise they can get you coming and going you cant prove that an action in the forest will not have any effect if you go hiking in the forest you could step on a seedling and i am going to tell you if you do a project in the forest you are going to have an effect that is why our legislation requires mitigation and

just so large that it goes out of our sphere of understanding as i was referencing before our conversation with regard to the family budget and the dollars that they spend there but at the end of the day the issue has really come down to the exact same thing and that is are you taking in as much money income your paycheck what have you through federal tax revenues as you are paying out at the end of the day do you have a balanced budget do you have a paycheck that is a problem for the american family this is a problem for the states as well as the gentlewoman knows i come from the great state of new jersey and people from new jersey know right now our state is having a difficult time with the state budget other people are looking in and they realize we are having a difficult time with the state budget we have a new governor who is trying to deal with this issue as a matter of fact in the state of new jersey we are looking at a 6 billion shortfall in revenue coming in what that means is that we have less money coming in than is going out at the end of the day for the state treasurer when he writes out his checkbook at the end of each day but what the state of new jersey has to do now of course is the same thing as the family budget that is they have to set priorities boundaries or limits but so too does the federal government the federal government is basically on some of the items that you have already raised we have to decide what are the priorities of the federal government i think one major word that you described for almost all of them is security homeland security economic security in the area of homeland security if you look at the budget that came out of the budget committee that i serve on we are planning to spend a 3 8 percent increase in homeland security to make sure that americans at home feel more secure that our borders are secure that the department of homeland security and the people that work for them have adequate money in order to get the job done another area of course for us in the area of security is defense we want to make sure that we are able to protect our nation protect the freedoms and the liberties that our fore fathers have fought and other generations have fought since that time for that reason in this budget we will be seeing a 7 percent increase in defense veterans of course is another area that this budget does not skimp on at all and i think the gentleman from texas gave some of the numbers before as far as the policy and the goals of this administration and of this republican congress to make sure that our veterans are adequately taken care of and protected so this budget does continue what this republican congress has done in the past it sets out what the appropriate priorities have got to be for this
