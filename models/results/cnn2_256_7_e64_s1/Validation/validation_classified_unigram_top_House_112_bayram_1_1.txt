that these cuts are too much too fast but its important to remember that these agencies and programs have seen unprecedented massive increases in spending in recent years this sort of excess has contributed to our astronomical debt and is threatening our recovery we simply cant fund unnecessary and ineffective programs when we are borrowing 42 cents on every dollar we spend we just simply cant afford it this legislation makes smart significant cuts across each and every agency funded by this bill the bill still adequately funds the agencies that are important to the health of our citizens the stability of our economy and the preservation of our environment but weve made some priority adjustments in areas that can and should withstand lower budgets some areas that will see bigger reductions include climate change programs which are trimmed 22 percent from last year and land acquisition funding which is at a level nearly 79 percent lower than last year frankly many of the cuts in this bill are just plain common sense particularly when it comes to the environmental protection agency the reductions and provisions in this bill were made with very good reasonto rein in unparalleled outofcontrol spending and jobkilling overregulation by the epa though we all appreciate the core mission of the epa this agency has lost grips with economic reality and has become the epitome of the continued and damaging regulatory overreach of this administration we cant allow an agency to circumvent the authority of congress especially when it has such destructive effects on our nations economic recovery id like to say that weve heard from americans all across the country and across every sector of the economy who attribute harsh regulatory burdens to their economic uncertainty uncertainty thats crushing job growth its my hope that this legislation sends the message loud and clear legislation by regulation must stop weve restricted funding for epa personnel as well as addressed epas flawed greenhouse gas regulations and de facto moratorium on mining permits in appalachia its my hope that provisions like these will return the epa to a better working order

simpson and ranking member moran the subcommittee and all of the staff for all their hard work on this very tough bill chairman simpson has led the way on an excellent bill i think that makes good on

that theyve gone above and beyond their duty to ensure that these cuts come from wasteful and redundant programs i know these decisions were not made lightly were not made easy but they are responsible and will help us move in the right direction although its been difficult at times the house should be proud to be moving this years appropriations process in regular order the first time

christmas tree lights up with christmas tree lights made in china it will be at 17 trillion were borrowing money from china where there are 25 catholic bishops under house arrest and hundreds of

away and has failed and the congressboth political partieshave walked away and failed i commend my friends mr cooper and mr latourette and ask for a yes vote on the simpsonbowles commission mr chair nearly six years agoduring the last republican house majorityi introduced legislation to create an independent bipartisan commission to address the deficit i called it the safe commission short for securing americas future economy everything would be on the table for discussionentitlements all other spending programs and tax policyand like the brac process congress would be required to vote up or down on the commissions recommendations my colleague and good friend jim cooper of tennessee joined me in sponsoring this legislation in 2007 and in subsequent years it ultimately became the blueprint for the presidents national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform more commonly referred to as the simpsonbowles commission the simpsonbowles commission produced a credible plan that gained the support of a bipartisan majority of the commissions 18 members called the moment of truth the commissions report made clear that eliminating the debt and deficit will not be easy and that any reform must begin with entitlements mandatory and discretionary spending also has to be addressed as well other sacred cows including tax reform and defense spending had just three more members of the simpsonbowles commission supported the recommendations this plan likely would have passed the congress and be law today i was disappointed that the president and his administration walked away from the commission the president failed the country leadership on both sides of the congressional aisle has done no better this town is dysfunctional if the plan had advanced we would already be on our way in getting our nations fiscal house in order over the past year and a half i have repeatedly said that while there are some changes i would make i would support a budget proposal similar to or based on simpsonbowles if it came to a vote on the house floor i want to commend mr cooper and mr latourete today for offering this substitute amendment which was drafted using the bipartisan principals of the simpsonbowles commission simpsonbowles provides the framework for the most comprehensive and realistic solution to our nations fiscal problems i have submitted the preamble of the simpsonbowles commission report for the record which i believe is a worthy read as we debate the cooperlatourette substitute every member of congress and the president know the dire economic situation facing our country a debt load over 15 5 trillion annual deficits over 1 trillion and unfunded obligations and liabilities over 65 trillion on the books to pay for programs such as social security medicare and medicaid were borrowing this money from nations such as chinawhich is spying on us where human rights are an afterthought and catholic bishops protestant ministers and tibetan monks are jailed for practicing their faithand oilexporting countries such as saudi arabiawhich funded the radical madrasahs on the afghanpakistan border resulting in the rise of the taliban and al qaeda we always say we want to leave our country better than we found it and to give our children and grandchildren hope for the future just today noted historian niall ferguson testified before my subcommittee and said that if we do not change course the debt burden will not only crush our children and grandchildren but also the current generation in the very near futu re according to the congressional budget offices long term estimate every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025 every penny that means no money for national defense no money for homeland security no money to fix the nations crumbling bridges and roads no money for medical research to find a cure for cancer or alzheimers or parkinsons diseases we have to find a solution to this debt crisis failure is not an option congress and the president must be willing to support a plan that breaks loose from the special interests holding washington by the throat and return confidence to the country congress and the president also need to be honest with the american people and explain that we cannot solve our nations financial crisis by just cutting waste fraud and abuse within discretionary accounts the real runaway spending is occurring in our outofcontrol entitlement costs and the hundreds of billions in annual tax earmarks until we reach an agreement that addresses these two drivers of our deficit and debts we cannot right our fiscal ship of state i amand have beenwilling to make the hard choices to ensure a better future for our children and grandchildren every two years i take an oath to support and defend the constitution i do not sign pledges to lobbyists or special interest groups if the cooperlatourette substitute does not pass today i will vote to support the ryan budget proposal so that we may move the budget process forward and continue the necessary discussions to address our nations financial crisis but i hope this substitute passes it is a balanced and ambitious roadmap to address our deficit it also is the only truly bipartisan plan that is being offered and i believe the only plan that has the opportunity to be approved by the senate more important this proposal calls for difficult decisions by finding savings to completely turn off the budget control acts looming sequestration which could devastate our defense capabilities as i mentioned earlier i do not agree with every recommendation in the simpsonbowles plan nor do i support every part of the cooperlatourette substitute for example i fully support efforts to repeal and replace the patient protection and affordable care act and regret that cooperlatourette is silent on the need to address this issue i am also concerned about the instructions proposed for the committee of jurisdiction over the federal workforce this could impact workers including the fbi and cia agents serving in afghanistan cbp agents stopping illegal immigrants coming across our borders the va doctors caring for our veterans and the nih medical researchers working to develop cures for cancer diabetes alzheimers and autism however the cooperlatourette substitute is the kind of bipartisan cooperation that we must have it is the kind of forthright realistic conversation about our nations fiscal future in which we must engage across the aisle across the capitol and down pennsylvania avenue if we are to have any hope of coming up with a credible plan to protect the future for our children and grandchildren every member should support this substitute preamble throughout our nations history americans have found the courage to do right by our childrens future deep down every american knows we face a moment of truth once again we cannot play games or put off hard choices any longer without regard to party we have a patriotic duty to keep the promise of america to give our children and grandchildren a better life our challenge is clear and inescapable america cannot be great if we go broke our businesses will not be able to grow and create jobs and our workers will not be able to compete successfully for the jobs of the future without a plan to get this crushing debt burden off our backs ever since the economic downturn families across the country have huddled around kitchen tables making tough choices about what they hold most dear and what they can learn to live without they expect and deserve their leaders to do the same the american people are counting on us to put politics aside pull together not pull apart and agree on a plan to live within our means and make america strong for the long haul as members of the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform we spent the past eight months studying the same cold hard facts together we have reached these unavoidable conclusions the problem is real the solution will be painful there is no easy way out everything must be on the table and washington must lead we come from different backgrounds represent different regions and belong to different parties but we share a common belief that americas longterm fiscal gap is unsustainable and if left unchecked will see our children and grandchildren living in a poorer weaker nation in the words of senator tom coburn we keep kicking the can down the road and splashing the soup all over our grandchildren every modest sacrifice we refuse to make today only forces far greater sacrifices of hope and opportunity upon the next generation over the course of our deliberations the urgency of our mission has become all the more apparent the contagion of debt that began in greece and continues to sweep through europe shows us clearly that no economy will be immune if the unitedstates does not put its house in order the reckoning will be sure and the devastation severe the president and the leaders of both parties in both chambers of congress asked us to address the nations fiscal challenges in this decade and beyond we have worked to offer an aggressive fair balanced and bipartisan proposal a proposal as serious as the problems we face none of us likes every element of our plan and each of us had to tolerate provisions we previously or presently oppose in order to reach a principled compromise we were willing to put our differences aside to forge a plan because our nation will certainly be lost without one we do not pretend to have all the answers we offer our plan as the starting point for a serious national conversation in which every citizen has an interest and all should have a say our leaders have a responsibility to level with americans about the choices we face and to enlist the ingenuity and determination of the american people in rising to the challenge we believe neither party can fix this problem on its own and both parties have a responsibility to do their part the american people are a long way ahead of the political system in recognizing that now is the time to act we believe that far from penalizing their leaders for making the tough choices americans will punish politicians for backing down and well they should in the weeks and months to come countless advocacy groups and special interests will try mightily through expensive dramatic and heartwrenching media assaults to exempt themselves from shared sacrifice and

lloyd doggett and i brought a bill to the floor that passed by voice vote to end the use of social security numbers on medicare cards most recently at an august 2012 ways and means committee joint subcommittee hearing gao questioned cmss lack of a serious plan to stop displaying the social security number while cms fails to act both the public and private sectors are working to protect their customers and businesses from identity theft the departments of defense and veterans affairs are removing social security numbers from their id and medical cards and i applaud them for taking that action private health insurance and many others ended the use of social security numbers on public documents a long time ago and even cms knows better it wont allow insurers in the medicare advantage and part d drug benefit programs to use social security numbers on their enrollees cards the time to protect our nearly 50 million americans carrying medicare cards with their personal information is

small states i know youre a delegation of two were a delegation of one i represent the whole state of delaware i tell my constituents that we have two senators and one member of congress that means that i have to work twice as hard to serve the people in my state im pleased to join my freshman colleagues on the democratic side of the aisle this afternoon for our discussion about small business and job creation and id like to talk for a little bit about the situation in my state the state of delaware all of us are coming off a district work week where we spent our time im sure meeting with constituents talking to business owners small business owners large business owners and working our districts and i did the same thing in delaware not too far from the capitol here i would like to highlight two meetings that i had in particular one was a job fair that we held in georgetown delaware which is the county seat in the lower part of our state many people from the washington d c area know georgetown as they pass through it to go to our lovely beaches during the summer time to enjoy time with their family at the beach this particular day we sponsored a job fair in georgetown along with senator carper and senator coons this was a program that senator coons championed in wilmington initially and weve moved it now to the other two counties of our state and had a job fair in dover and a job fair in georgetown this past week really helping to connect those folks in our state who are unemployed or underemployed people looking to move up with employers who are looking to hire and even though we have over 9 percent unemployment nationally and a little bit over 8 percent unemployment in our state of delaware there are still a lot of jobs that go wanting mostly because the employers are not able to find people that have the required skills for that particular enterprise so the good news about this job fair is that we had 55 employers there many of whom were prepared to hire people and offer them jobs certainly take resumes and interview people or set up interviews but we had over 8 000 people who came seeking employment or seeking an upgrade in their current job situation and thats a lot of people in the small state of delaware in the least populous area of our state so it tells us the very serious problem that we have with the lack of jobs and the lack of skills that people might have to do the jobs that are out there later on in the week i met at pats aircraft which is an airplane manufacturing facility at georgetown airport theyve been hiring airplane mechanics over the last several years in fact when i was lieutenant governor one of the biggest problems that they had was finding workers that had the requisite skills to do the jobs that they had now they have since lost some of that work but they were looking ahead and anticipating with some assistance from the faa to extend the runway there at georgetown airportgoing back to your point about the need for infrastructure to stir business development business growth and job creation if we were able to extend the runway there at the airport pats would be able to hire more mechanics but there are a lot of people out there while they might want those jobs would not have the skills to do the work and so delaware technical and community college with the help of the state government has developed a training program specifically to prepare workers for that facility and other airplane manufacturing facilities in our region we have a dassault falcon plant which does airplane maintenance and mechanics at the new castle county airport as well as a large boeing facility over the line in southeastern pennsylvania so these are jobs they are highly skilled jobs they are jobs that require mechanical ability they are jobs that require training and there are certainly lots of folks out there that are looking for employment and these are the kinds of jobs that we need to prepare people for one of the press conferences we had this week was at delaware technical community college where we highlighted a federal grant that was going to delaware tech to create training programs for businesses basically to enable people to upgrade their skills to take the jobs that are available one of the problems obviously that we have in our countryand the presidents employment council has identified this problemis that we have jobs that are out there but we dont have people with the right kinds of skills for those jobs so we need to have programsand this is where the public sector comes into play particularly technical and community collegesto provide that training and those skills for those folks later on in the week i met and spoke with the georgetown chamber of commerce and the georgetown chamber of course is comprised mostly of very small businesses they had a really simple message for me as a member of congress and that is that they see their businesses struggling because of a lack of confidence among consumers and when you think about the unitedstates economy at large about 70 percent of economic activity is consumer driven so when consumers dont have confidence either in their employment situation in the presentthey may not be employedor their future employment situation theyre not willing to spend money on small business services or products in the community and therefore these small businesses suffer so their message to me was really a simple one twofold one is do no harm in washington dc do the work of the people solve the problems that we have and inspire confidence and i think one of the ways that we can do thattheres a lot of discussion most of the discussion that i hear from my constituents in the state of delawareand weve had town hall meetings were going to have a telephone town hall meeting tonight im sure i will hear the same thing enough with the partisan bickering back and forth across the aisle lets focus on the challenges that we facecreating jobs and strengthening businesses creating a business climate in the short term where businesses can thrive where consumers can have confidence so theyll be willing to spend on small businesses and other procurement and in the long term address our deficits our debt and our budget imbalances if were able to do that well at least provide some confidence to the people that we represent that those that they send from delaware the members of the house of representatives here and our senators across the capitol are doing their part are working together are focused on not the politics of where we all stand in relation to the next election but on solving the problems that face our country i think the vote that we have coming at the end of this year which will be the result of the work of the committee on the budget will be maybe one of the most important votes in a number of years i have heard our majority whip steny hoyer refer to it as the most important vote here in the last 30 years and i think thats right in many respects because people out there my constituents your constituents ms hanabusa in hawaiii see our colleague from rhode island has joined us as wellour constituents are asking us begging us to do our work to inspire confidence and to do the right thing for the country and that involves giving people the skills they need to be able to do the jobs that are available out there creating confidence so businesses can make investments so people will be willing to spend money and consume so our economy will get back on its feet again in the long term well set up a fiscal situation with our government so that the economy can be strong and create jobs for my children and their children so i want to thank my colleague from hawaii for leading our dialogue this afternoon on job creation on small business development across our country in our respective districts and i look forward to sitting here with you for a few more minutes and engaging in this dialogue i just wanted to give a few words about how the people in delaware are responding to the work that we are doing or are not doing here in the

about the governors of all 50 states be they republican or democrat and the territories to be told by the boss again that no you cant be an incubation center you cannot be innovative in regard to

level 5 or 6 years ago long before this patient protection affordable care act even was on the drawing board but when you have things in the bill when the boss writes a section of the bill that says states it doesnt matter that you have to balance your budget we dont at the federal level but were going to dictate to you that youre going to have to start covering medicaid constituency up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level were going to put that into law thats part of this new law obamacare and you have no choice now were going to give you a little breathing room and were going to say its not going to start for a couple of years indeed january of 2014 you have got to expand your medicaid rolls from the typical state covers 100 percent of the federal poverty level this goes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level and the boss says well well pay all of it with federal dollars for the first couple years but were going to phase that out and then oh yes guess what happens the boss adds eventually at the end of the day 60 billion to state medicaid costs and also there is a section in the bill that tells the states and its called maintenance of effort you cant change one thing that you currently do in your medicaid program to prepare yourself for this tsunami if youre covering today 185 percent of the federal poverty level you cant all of a sudden say well gosh you know were going to have to lower that to 150 percent and put some oats away and get ready for that real rainy day in 2014 we heard from another governor today in that hearingthere were threegovernor deval patrick of massachusetts was one and governor haley barbour from mississippi was the other and governor barbour was saying that a couple of years ago he instituted a program in the state of mississippi that would make sure that people that were on the medicaid program were eligible that they deserved to be there they werent eating somebody elses lunch as the expression would go they werent illegal immigrants their income wasnt too high to make them eligible for this safetynet program and of course as we all know thank goodness income from year to year can get better were still waiting for that to happen i think obamacare and some of these other policies that were seeing over the last 4 years is preventing that from happening so governor barbour would make people come and face to face verify that they were still eligible from year to year as i understand it this rule this maintenance of effort would prohibithe has already done it in mississippibut in any other state as an example to make sure your rolls were clean and were you covering the people that were eligible and that really needed that care this is the kind of thing that we are dealing with and why

services to submit a report to congress detailing the effect that the tort reform provisions in this bill would have on health care premiums and delays the effective date of title i of the bill until that report is submitted for years proponents of tort reform have tried to convince americans that skyrocketing health care costs are entirely attributable to greedy plaintiffs and runaway jury awards they recite anecdotes about doctors closing their practices refusing to deliver babies or perform surgeries for fear of being sued but we should not be making federal policy based on anecdotes if recent independent research is any indication the report that the secretary submits to congress under this amendment is unlikely to find that the bill will have any meaningful effect on health care premiums recent analysis in states adopting restrictions similar to those in this bill has found no substantial impact on the consumer cost of health care nor has access to health providers improved as a result proponents of tort reform claim that capping damages will drive down the cost of medical malpractice insurance and that doctors will pass this savings along to patients but 2 years ago cbo found that malpractice insurance premiums settlements and awards account for just a tiny fraction of total health care expenditures in 27 states where damages have been capped the medical malpractice premiums are not lower on average than in states without caps my amendment asks for data on how this bill will affect the cost of health care for all americans now i want to be very clearno one should be compensated for a frivolous lawsuit but there are ways to address frivolous lawsuits without infringing on the rights of those who truly have been injured by medical mistakes what this bill does accomplish ought to frighten anyone who believes in the rights of states to govern themselves and the rights of individuals to be compensated for loss this bill tramples over the rights of states to enact laws governing their own tort systems and it severely restricts individuals rights to be compensated for all the losses caused by health care providers in my home state of oregon for example our supreme court has held that most statutory caps on noneconomic damages are unconstitutional and oregon is not alone at least 12 other states have some constitutional prohibition against these types of restrictions this bill not only overrides state laws and constitutions governing punitive and noneconomic damage awards it also addresses states statutes of limitations pleading standards attorneyfee provisions and joint liability but it does not stop there although this bill is being presented as medical malpractice reform it reaches far beyond professional malpractice against doctors to include product liability cases against drug and device manufacturers badfaith claims against hmos and insurance companies and negligence suits against nursing homes and it would take away all of the state and individual rights in farreaching areas of the health care industry without evidence that doing so will lower the premiums for americans this is an unwarranted intrusion in personal liberty and a giveaway to insurance companies so we should know if its going to lower health care premiums if this congress is going to enact a sweeping bill nullifying longstanding state law and trampling on state constitutional rights its not too much to ask that we arm ourselves with the knowledge of how this will actually affect american families this amendment simply requires the secretary of health and

ranked as the fifth winningest college basketball coach in america with 668 wins stretching over his remarkable career he is also the third winningest coach in atlantic coast conference history behind two legends dean smith and mike krzyzewski gary williams inherited a struggling program and turned it into a perennial national contender under his guidance the terrapins reached the ncaa tournament

still treasure and i had the opportunity of attending in atlanta won the national championship in 2002 coach williams was honored as national coach of the year in 2002 and as acc coach of the year in

agreement sitting there are union folk ready to go to work all it has to do is be approved the permit for this approved by the president once he says yes 20 000 people go to work and we put ourselves on a path to greater energy security thats one of the reasons why i fought so hard to get onto the energy and commerce committeeto set us on a path to energy security where we dont have to send our money unitedstates consumers dollars to buy the energy necessary to propel our economy but a funny thing happened on the road to energy security the environmentalists said that this is heavy crude and it is going to expel in the process too much co2 they want to stop fossil fuels so instead of using the most energyefficient refineries in the world that would have the least emissions of c02 i guess the environmental community would rather it go to china where they have few pollution and carbon controls on their refineries and by the way china just bought half of the oil sands just a week ago theyd be glad to buy the other half if we dont so its going to be refined the president has until february 21 to say yes or no to this that was by act of congress setting that deadline because the original application was filed september of 2008 3 years and 4 months ago the average is 18 months for a transcontinental pipeline this administration has been dragging its feet because they dont want to irritate the environmental community which has been heightened now since were into an election year i wish we could have done this before we got into 2012 where it could be based on the merits and not the politics but politics is what were dealing with right now the president said several times in the last few weeks that geez because congress has forced my hand on making a decision before february 21 thats not enough time so i may just have to deny it well thats complete bull heres a document i apologize to the gallery and maybe our cspan viewers because the print is rather small but this is an administration document from their agency dated july 25 executive office of the president july 25 let me read the important sentence here the significant sentence in their document the bill that we had then on july 25 they say its unnecessary because the department of statewho makes the recommendation to the presidenthas been working diligently to complete the permit decision process for the keystone xl pipeline and has publicly committed to reaching a decision before december 31 2011 two other documents from the state department have said that they have all the information they need theyre working diligently and they will have the recommendation to the president by december 31 2011 which of course they have not made and the president says geez congress no reason for you to get involved because were working diligently and we have all the information we need and we will make a decision then just prior to december 31 theyre starting to say we want more information or youre putting us in a box where were going to have to say no bull this is all politics stop playing politics mr president and put us on a road that we can be energy independent and at a time of high unemployment where these tradespeople are standing around waiting for work put them back to work now mr president i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.00617903470993042, 0.5061790347099304, 1, "i

of prevention im pleased to have cointroduced this resolution with a bipartisan group of colleagues including the chair ms roslehtinen indeed this congress this administration and this president understand that failing to prevent a nucleararmed iran would ignite a destabilizing arms race in the middle east would threaten the very existence of our ally israel and would endanger the security of the american people as iran faces growing international isolation now is not the time to roll back crippling economic sanctions nor should we fall victim to this regimes penchant of hiding behind the pretense of negotiations simply to buy more time with this resolution we will send a message to irans regime and to the world that the unitedstates will accept nothing less than a strict policy of

towards a very specific and growing threat to our nation every day american businesses are being targeted by china russia and other foreign actors for cyberexploitation and theft these acts of industrial espionage are causing enormous losses of valuable american intellectual property that ultimately costs the united states jobs we cannot afford to allow highpaying jobs to be stolen in this manner nor can we simply sit by and allow the cyberwarfare being conducted against us to continue without consequences madam chairman jobs are at stake as is the technological capital of the united states but if the reality of this economic cyberwarfare isnt convincing enough you should understand that there are other good reasons for us to support this bill the stateoftheart technology stolen from americans can easily be turned against us and represents a serious threat to americas critical infrastructure none in this body would likely disagree that we have to prevent our enemies from protecting american military technology thats why we have long had export controls and other mechanisms to prevent such a thing from occurring madam chairman how is the theft of intellectual property any less a threat today whether we like it or not cyberwarfare is a reality our government and its security agencies understand this and are using both classified and unclassified information to fight the threat but without passage of this bill they are being forced to do so without the meaningful participation of industriesprivate industriesthat are being subjected to attacks that in some cases our government even knows about but cannot share that with those private companies so we shouldnt expect americas private sector innovators to protect themselves if we wont tell them where the attacks are coming from if we dont share this information or allow them to share information with us how do we expect to secure the sensitive information the acting chair the time of the gentleman has

strongest possible terms the senseless act of violence that claimed their lives that so many victims were young children who had their entire lives ahead of them makes the shooting even more

huge new york giants fan and today was buried in a giants jersey and noah pozner who is also 6 whose best friend was his twin sister arielle who was in another class and survived though im sure she felt she lost her other self these children were truly innocent mostly knowing in their short lives just joy and little about the brutality in this world until they experienced it firsthand on friday

grateful for their commitment to helping the children that need it the most april is recognized as national child abuse prevention month unfortunately sexual abuse of children is still a serious problem in our country and too many cases go unreported my colleague from california and i have introduced h r 3486 the speak out to stop child abuse act which would require states that receive federal funding under their child abuse prevention and treatment act to have a law on the books that makes it a criminal penalty for any adult who knowingly fails to report the sexual abuse of a child h r 3486 simply asks states to help by requiring adults who witness the sexual abuse of a child to report it i want to thank congresswoman bass for introducing this legislation and i also recommend all of my colleagues help support this also"]]}
