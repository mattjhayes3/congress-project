abortioninducing drugs and contraception catholic employers who fail to provide that insurance coverage could be fined 2 000 per employee per year and the obama administration will force catholics to buy insurance coverage that includes coverage for services that many of them find morally wrong for many catholics this requirement violates their core beliefs about the sanctity of life of the unborn the health care law that is forcing catholics to put their government ahead of their god includes a religious conscience exemption it allows people with certain religious objections to opt out and some religious groups have been allowed to opt out but catholics have been denied an optout instead the obama administration is forcing catholics to violate their religious conscience this is not the united states of america that i know religious tolerance has been a bedrock principle of the american government for almost 240 years its one of the reasons why the united states came to exist in the first place the first amendment states that americans have the right to religious freedom religious freedom isnt just the ability to believe and worship as we see fit its also our right to keep other beliefs from being imposed on us the federal government has respected those rights by being sensitive by creating tolerant policies regarding our military service our tax policies and even our airport

agree no matter on what side of the aisle we stand that the right to freely express our religious beliefsand more importantly not have other beliefs forced upon usis a core value of this country it is

establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof theyre first and theyre first for a reason the united states of america has long been a place of religious freedom its one of the things that separates us from foreign countries just as the federal government should not endorse a religion it should not punish a religion either all religions must be treated equally they must be respected thats the american way today catholics all across the united states feel like outsiders they feel as if their government has betrayed them catholic leaders including three bishops that lead catholics in my district have clearly said they cannot and will not comply with this unjust decision by the obama administration no one should have to choose between their god and their government and no one especially a government founded on religious freedom should force them to the decision by this administration to make catholics violate their most basic principles is a violation of the most

constitution is an exceptional document and we have all taken an oath to defend it and defend it we must too often our constitution is under attack by the liberal activist movement that seeks to achieve through the courts that which they cannot achieve at the ballot box on the front line are the unelected judges that disregard the words and meaning of the constitution in favor of their own political and social views they decide cases not on the law and the facts but on the outcome that they alone believe to be the best policy roe v wade is an example of this sort of judicial activism at its worst together with other cases the roe court created a fundamental right to abortion even though a simple reading of the constitution reveals no such right as a result unimaginable harm has occurred in the short time that i have talked tonight another baby has been aborted that equals one abortion every 2 minutes 3 300 abortions a day or 1 2 million abortions a year i am unapologetically prolife i believe that the miracle of human life begins at conception i believe that we are fearfully and wonderfully made knit together by god in our mothers womb i believe that every american is entitled to basic human rights and i believe that i have an obligation to do everything i can to fight for the unborn to prevent taxpayer money from funding abortions and to protect our democratic system from the encroachment of an allpowerful judiciary let us use this 38th anniversary of roe v wade as an occasion to reaffirm our beliefs and redirect ourselves to that cause"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "9 months after the administration sent 1 200 national guard troops to the border washington has decided that it is time for the troops to withdraw in my opinion this decision is dangerously irresponsible violence has already spilled into the united states from mexico the 16 texas border counties are packed with foreign nationals charged with serious crimes in the united states according to the gao 56 percent of the border is wide open and instead of fulfilling their duty to protect the people of this country washington orders retreat it defies logic that we would remove the national guard from the border if anything we need more troops on the ground doesnt washington know that the border is a war zone to abandon the third front puts americans at risk with crossborder crime this is a national security issue that cannot be ignored it is the first duty of the federal government to protect the people and the homeland not order retreat and thats just the way it is"], [0.5, 0.0,

these high gas prices is the continued political upheaval in the middle east and the impact that its having on economic uncertainty around the world keystone would bring nearly a million barrels of oil from our friendly neighbor canada to the north and also up to 100 000 barrels of oil from the bakken discoveries in montana and north dakota it would also put more americans to work while improving our energy security the department of energy has stated that gasoline prices in all markets served by the gulf coast and east coast refiners would decrease as a result of the pipelines construction the white house would be welladvised to consider a poll that i took in a recent teletown hall of our constituents where 87 percent of the constituents said that they strongly supported

the need for fairness fairness he said is an american value yet the president and his administration are blatantly ignoring one of the most basic of american valuesthe freedom of religion im referring to the decision by the obama administration to force catholic employers to provide insurance that includes coverage for sterilization abortioninducing drugs and contraception catholic employers who fail to provide that insurance coverage could be fined 2 000 per employee per year and the obama administration will force catholics to buy insurance coverage that includes coverage for services that many of them find morally wrong for many catholics this requirement violates their core beliefs about the sanctity of life of the unborn the health care law that is forcing catholics to put their government ahead of their god includes a religious conscience exemption it allows people with certain religious objections to opt out and some religious groups have been allowed to opt out but catholics have been denied an optout instead the obama administration is forcing catholics to violate their religious conscience this is not the united states of america that i know religious tolerance has been a bedrock principle of the american government for almost 240 years its one of the reasons why the united states came to exist in the first place the first amendment states that americans have the right to religious freedom religious freedom isnt just the ability to believe and worship as we see fit its also our right to keep other beliefs from being imposed on us the federal government has respected those rights by being sensitive by creating tolerant policies regarding our military service our tax policies and even our airport screenings american catholics are not asking for special rights were asking for equal rights i am proudly prolife and i will stand here to defend the rights of the unborn but this isnt about abortion this isnt a question of when life begins this is about the fundamental rights of all americans as spelled out in our founding documents and this decision by the obama administration is a devastating blow against the freedom of religion its one thing for the federal government to try to take over our health care system and we can all debate the merits of such legislation but i think we can all agree no matter on what side of the aisle we stand that the right to freely express our religious beliefsand more importantly not have other beliefs forced upon usis a core value of this country it is nonnegotiable good people of all faiths should be outraged by this decision if this administration can trample on the beliefs and rights of the american catholics those of other religions should ask are we next yesterday i read in the new york times that legal scholars say the american constitution is old and outdated that it isnt relevant in the modern world now as this administration ignores our most treasured valuesnot religious values but american valuesour constitution could not be more relevant the first words of the american bill of rights are congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof theyre first and theyre first for a reason the united states of america has long been a place of religious freedom its one of the things that separates us from foreign countries just as the federal government should not endorse a religion it should not punish a religion either all religions must be treated equally they must be respected thats the american way today catholics all across the united states feel like outsiders they feel as if their government has betrayed them catholic leaders including three bishops that lead catholics in my district have clearly said they cannot and will not comply with this unjust decision by the obama administration no one should have to choose between their god and their government and no one especially a government founded on religious freedom should force them to the decision by this administration to make catholics violate their most basic principles is a violation of the most basic american principle i strongly condemn the obama administration for this outrageous overreach of federal authority and i strongly encourage the administration to rescind this unfair unamerican policy if the obama administration can take away this most basic american value for 80 million catholics whos next"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a gallon of gas is over 4 heading to 5 the average family spends 2 200 more on gas than they did 2 years ago fourteen million americans are out of work and wondering how they are going to put food on the table americas infrastructure is crumbling a quarter of our bridges are structurally deficient the american society of civil engineers says all our infrastructure needs are going to cost over 2 trillion for roads bridges water sewer systems airports locks and dams where will we find the money well we send 100 billion each day to foreign nations for oil opec exerts control over world oil prices and wants it to be 200 per barrel we are 60 percent dependent on foreign oil and climbing as a country we waste 20 to 40 percent of our energy in inefficient buildings and factories we want clean air and water we want to see our highways and bridges fixed we want clean power plants lower energy prices and dont pollute our environment but where will the money come from today my colleagues and i on the energy working group are introducing the infrastructure jobs and energy independence act a bipartisan bill that for the first time brings forward a comprehensive plan to rebuild america take back our energy future and create millions of jobs we can become energy independent we can create these jobs and we can do it all without raising taxes or adding to the national debt how well america has enough offshore reserves to replace all oil imports from venezuela and saudi arabia for the next 80 years and enough clean natural gas to power industry for the next 63 years yet the drilling moratorium means that instead of using our own resources to grow jobs we are supporting the economies of unstable regimes that want to do us harm our plan opens the door to the safe responsible expansion of energy production off our coasts where there is 8 trillion worth of economic output in oil and gas reserves offshore over 20 years that translates to between 2 5 trillion and 3 7 trillion in new federal revenues from lease rights and royalties without raising taxes that is 440 billion for infrastructure of our roads and bridges 330 billion that we will invest in renewable energy sources and buildings and transportation 220 billion for clean coal technology 88 billion for environmental restoration to clean up our lakes bays rivers and streams 66 billion in energy conservation 110 billion for carbonfree technology and nuclear energy development 66 billion to rebuild our water and sewer systems in small towns and big cities all across america 44 billion for liheap and 660 billion for states that are producing and also several hundred billion to pay down the national debt there is a plan for jobs and energy in america and this is the plan that estimates are will create about 1 million jobs each year new jobs in building highways and bridges new jobs in developing our energy resources and we can do it all i ask my colleagues to support the infrastructure jobs and energy independence act lets rebuild america lets create jobs without raising taxes lets stop borrowing from foreign nations lets pay down our national debt lets stop buying from opec and lets use our rules and our laws to make sure we do all of this in a way that is environmentally sound so we can create jobs and have energy independence for this and the next generation"]]}
