with the gold rush northern california was the main destination of those in search of quick wealth the banks of the feather river yielded great riches to those who were in the right place at the right time but the precious metal that caused a rush to the west was not the only treasure that california possessed young settlers whose dreams had not materialized in the gold fields soon turned to the fertile central valley and envisioned golden acres of grain today those acres are covered with fruit trees rice fields and almond and walnut orchards as the valley continues to yield its agricultural treasure making california the leading agricultural economy in the world others looked at the golden promise in the vast forests their labor provided the lumber for the growing towns and cities of northern california a tremendous renewable resource to the american people our forests provide materials for homes and businesses as well as endless recreational opportunities and habitat for unique plant and animal species some entrepreneurs recognized that there were other ways to gather gold than simply panning in a streambed they opened dry goods stores banks and hotels women found that they could earn a living utilizing their household skills cooking and cleaning for miners who couldnt california was born a land of golden opportunities and to this day she continues to call to those willing to take a risk in order to improve their own lives many came to california for only a visit but stayed a lifetime the specious skies majestic mountains and rushing rivers of northern california stirred their souls while her fertile valleys gentle climate and endless opportunities captured their imagination yes gold fever may have lured early settlers here but even though the

precipitating the korean war unprepared south korean or rok forces and the handful of americans on the ground were incapable of halting this swift and brutal assault in a matter of days the badly battered unitedstates and rok units had been pushed back to a tiny toehold on the southern tip of the korean peninsula it was only with determination and unbelievable courage that american forces together with south korean and allied troops were able to push back the attacking north korean army the breakout of the pusan perimeter the inchon landing battles like pork chop hill and heartbreak ridge the terrible fight against overwhelming odds at the frozen chosin reservoir on these and countless other unnamed battlefields we beat back the invaders the korean conflict reflected the absolute determination of the united states to halt the spread of tyranny and totalitarianism but the cost was high the war that north korea started resulted in 39 000 unitedstates deaths and over 100 000 wounded and severely undermined unitedstates relations with russia and china it took decades for our south korean ally to recover in the socalled democratic peoples republic of korea the dprk there is certainly a very different and distorted interpretation of the events that occurred 50 years ago incredibly according to the north korean news agency quote the unitedstates instigated the rok army to start a surprise armed invasion of north korea on june 25 1950 it was commanded by the unitedstates military advisory group end of quote the newscast goes on to explain that in precipitating this unprovoked attack the unitedstates supposedly indiscriminately carpet bombed throughout north korea these lies from north korea newscasts are not from some ancient historical record no this was the broadcast in the last several weeks it is worth noting that this slanderous pack of lies was broadcast right after the recent historic meeting between south korean president kim dae jung and north korean leader kim jong il it was broadcast the day after the united states had announced the delivery to north korea of an additional 50 000 tons of grain and about the same time that north korea was reinventing history secretary of state albright was announcing that north korea is not a terrorist state or even a rogue state but merely a state of concern this member points this out because of the recent changes in perception regarding north korea on the verge of collapse the hermit kingdom is at least attempting to give the impression that it is reaching out to south korea and to the west if north korea is in fact sincere in its peaceful overtures that certainly would be a dramatic positive development however it would be premature to assume that the dprk has irrevocably reformed its behavior it would be naive in the extreme to believe that a few gestures constitute a reversion of 50 years of violently confrontational behavior and terrorism and it would be foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary he must continue to view north korea as a terrorist state and to regard the korean peninsula as the place on the globe where american forces might again be attacked and a tragically costly war begun again"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "a couple of different points that i want to make here one is that this is a very difficult process we have a budget agreement that the president says he supports that all of us in congress say we support that calls for very difficult appropriations levels and quite bluntly none of us are really happy with it we want to keep the budget caps we are trying to stay with the budget agreement we all go out home and say we want to save all this money for social security but when it comes to each bill it is always well we really need this we really need that we have been trying to save a little bit of money in each one because a number of us strongly felt that while everybody talks about the need to stay within the budget agreement the fact is that the money we had on the table for laborhhs for interior and veterans was not sufficient and that every side was kind of doing a winkwink and saying well we are trying to try to stay within the caps and within the budget agreement knowing we were not working towards that every dollar we save in this appropriations bill the agriculture appropriations bill is going to be able to be used for those programs that the gentleman from wisconsin and others have said they are concerned about and will help us preserve social security that is the real tradeoff yes it will be difficult for members offices to live under a freeze which is in effect a reduction but we also gave each member of congress flexibility to move their funds around and most members do not even spend their full account furthermore this is another round in my opinion of pick on the majority whip the plain truth of the matter is that the majority and minority are both getting the same amount of money in this we reduced in this agreement the amendment that will be offered the money going to leadership not by a lot but by some this amendment does not really please anybody but at least it moves the ball forward and reduces some funds overall the minority leader the gentleman from missouri gets the same amount as the majority whip he can either give it to the minority whip or do it elsewhere the fact is that early on for many different reasons in the majority side the whips office was disproportionately cut in its budget that is why the majority is choosing to put the money in the whips office the minority has the same amount of funds what is good for one side is good for the other we have also reduced the committee spending we need to lead by example every dollar we can save in the operations that support congress in our own operations in all of the many organizations here we can put into educating our children into the health concerns raised by the gentleman from california in the difference diseases we can put it into our national defense that is one of the problems here we have just seen all of our secrets in our military offensive and defensive pc tentially be at risk to china at the same time unless we spend more money in defense we are completely vulnerable if we spend more money there it

the two congresses previously we are averaging 24 to 29 percent per year increase take a million dollars under thishold harmless at the end of 5 years that means they would have 750 000 but at a growth rate of 24 to 29 percent what they would actually have is well over a million dollars at the end of that 5 years so we are into the specifics of talking about a cut when there is no cut the fact is there is extreme imbalance in the amount of funding that is going to the ema in san francisco versus other areas and it is recognized this legislation is not intended to hurt san francisco i will have a private wager with the gentleman and gentlewomen from california that in 5 years there will be more money under this formula for each of those emas than there is today including san francisco because in fact if we increase something 25 percent per year at the end of 5 years we will not have 200 percent we will have about 270 percent so even with the 25 percent cut if that would happen and that is just the potential i understand my colleagues should be concerned to protect what is already coming in the second point that i would make is that the testimony from the gao clearly said that there is a disparity in the funding and they clearly said that the foundational factor under which we made that funding was based on what the funding was in 1990 which was evidence of those who had hiv had aids and had died so the base that is used for the san francisco ema continues to recognize in its base not people living with hiv but people who have died from aids people living with aids what our formula will say is if hiv increases in san francisco they will get more money as people live longer they will get more money and what we do is to make sure somebody who lives in south

riches to those who were in the right place at the right time but the precious metal that caused a rush to the west was not the only treasure that california possessed young settlers whose dreams had not materialized in the gold fields soon turned to the fertile central valley and envisioned golden acres of grain today those acres are covered with fruit trees rice fields and almond and walnut orchards as the valley continues to yield its agricultural treasure making california the leading agricultural economy in the world others looked at the golden promise in the vast forests their labor provided the lumber for the growing towns and cities of northern california a tremendous renewable resource to the american people our forests provide materials for homes and businesses as well as endless recreational opportunities and habitat for unique plant and animal species some entrepreneurs recognized that there were other ways to gather gold than simply panning in a streambed they opened dry goods stores banks and hotels women found that they could earn a living utilizing their household skills cooking and cleaning for miners who couldnt california was born a land of golden opportunities and to this day she continues to call to those willing to take a risk in order to improve their own lives many came to california for only a visit but stayed a lifetime the specious

have lured early settlers here but even though the stores of that precious metal have mostly given out people still flock to california today as a third generation northern californian i am very proud

the 38th parallel and precipitating the korean war unprepared south korean or rok forces and the handful of americans on the ground were incapable of halting this swift and brutal assault in a matter of days the badly battered unitedstates and rok units had been pushed back to a tiny toehold on the southern tip of the korean peninsula it was only with determination and unbelievable courage that american forces together with south korean and allied troops were able to push back the attacking north korean army the breakout of the pusan perimeter the inchon landing battles like pork chop hill and heartbreak ridge the terrible fight against overwhelming odds at the frozen chosin reservoir on these and countless other unnamed battlefields we beat back the invaders the korean conflict reflected the absolute determination of the united states to halt the spread of tyranny and totalitarianism but the cost was high the war that north korea started resulted in 39 000 unitedstates deaths and over 100 000 wounded and severely undermined unitedstates relations with russia and china it took decades for our south korean ally to recover in the socalled democratic peoples republic of korea the dprk there is certainly a very different and distorted interpretation of the events that occurred 50 years ago incredibly according to the north korean news agency quote the unitedstates instigated the rok army to start a surprise armed invasion of north korea on june 25 1950 it was commanded by the unitedstates military advisory group end of quote the newscast goes on to explain that in precipitating this unprovoked attack the unitedstates supposedly indiscriminately carpet bombed throughout north korea these lies from north korea newscasts are not from some ancient historical record no this was the broadcast in the last several weeks it is worth noting that this slanderous pack of lies was broadcast right after the recent historic meeting between south korean president kim dae jung and north korean leader kim jong il it was broadcast the day after the united states had announced the delivery to north korea of an additional 50 000 tons of grain and about the same time that north korea was reinventing history secretary of state albright was announcing that north korea is not a terrorist state or even a rogue state but merely a state of concern this member points this out because of the recent changes in perception regarding north korea on the verge of collapse the hermit kingdom is at least attempting to give the impression that it is reaching out to south korea and to the west if north korea is in fact sincere in its peaceful overtures that certainly would be a dramatic positive development however it would be premature to assume that the dprk has irrevocably reformed its behavior it would be naive in the extreme to believe that a few gestures constitute a reversion of 50 years of violently confrontational behavior and terrorism and it would be foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary he must continue to view north korea as a terrorist state and to regard the korean peninsula as the place on the globe where american forces might again be attacked and a tragically costly war begun again"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a couple of different points that i

all this money for social security but when it comes to each bill it is always well we really need this we really need that we have been trying to save a little bit of money in each one because a number of us strongly felt that while everybody talks about the need to stay within the budget agreement the fact is that the money we had on the table for laborhhs for interior and veterans was not sufficient and that every side was kind of doing a winkwink and saying well we are trying to try to stay within the caps and within the budget agreement knowing we were not working towards that every dollar we save in this appropriations bill the agriculture appropriations bill is going to be able to be used for those programs that the gentleman from wisconsin and others have said they are concerned about and will help us preserve social security that is the real tradeoff yes it will be difficult for members offices to live under a freeze which is in effect a reduction but we also gave each member of congress flexibility to move their funds around and most members do not even spend their full account furthermore this is another round in my opinion of pick on the majority whip the plain truth of the matter is that the majority and minority are both getting the same amount of money in this we reduced in this agreement the amendment that will be offered the money going to leadership not by a lot but by some this amendment does not really please anybody but at least it moves the ball forward and reduces some funds overall the minority leader the gentleman from missouri gets the same amount as the majority whip he can either give it to the minority whip or do it elsewhere the fact is that early on for many different reasons in the majority side the whips office was disproportionately cut in its budget that is why the majority is choosing to put the money in the whips office the minority has the same amount of funds what is good for one side is good for the other we have also reduced the committee spending we need to lead by example every dollar we can save in the operations that support congress in our own operations in all of the many organizations here we can put into educating our children into the health concerns raised by the gentleman from california in the difference diseases we can put it into our national defense that is one of the problems here we have just seen all of our secrets in our military offensive and defensive pc tentially be at risk to china at the same time unless we spend more money in defense we are completely vulnerable if we spend more money there it squeezes elsewhere i believe this amount of sacrifice is minimal on our parts and it is courageous because normally congress does not allow any amendment on the leg branch i
