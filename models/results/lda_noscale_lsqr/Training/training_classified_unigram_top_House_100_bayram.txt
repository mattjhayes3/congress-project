convenient for whoever is speaking the fact is that central america has been a place of great desperation for a long long time the somozas dominated nicaragua for 40 years america conveniently extended support at times when indeed we should have been pressuring for change that did not come through democratic and republican administrations over too many years in my first session in 1979 that debate was raging and america had made a decision to push the somozas out in order to provide hope freedom and opportunity economic growth and change and suddenly after that crisis we began to give money in sizable form to a new government and that new government suddenly we found was not the one we expected the business people of nicaragua had gone back to work others forgot about the crisis and the communists of nicaragua took over and the very people who came to this floor and pied to give freedom a chance peace a chance suddenly found the sandinista communists to be ok suddenly they

has never seen 1 hours worth of hearings in nor any examination by the cor mittees of the congress who have developed the expertise in drafting health care legislation and in providing secure funding for it no one knows if the bill before us is financially sound i wouldnt oppose a bill on an important subject like this on merely procedural grounds but there is good reason for a sound process and this bill coming as it does directly to the floor from the pen of the sponsor without any intervening examination has bypassed every opportunity this institution provides to be sure that legislation

benefitsonly to find that it increased them too much we could not afford to pay benefits that generous without breaking the social security system so congress went back and tried to correct its mistake and presto the notch years were created in short congress was trying to do a good thing but it did not take the time to do it right we are about to do that all over again there is legislation in the senate to address the need for home health care there is legis lation being developed in the house to deal with this very same issue they are proceed ing through the regular process and they will come before this bodywith a track record of analysis that can demonstrate that it will be workable we should let those efforts proceed but trying to rush a measurehowever well meaningthat has

care only to have to dash the hopes when we discover that the program was not well thought out or properly financed that turns hope to despair fortunately our choice is not between passing this bill

district shut its doors there was no notice given to the workers i was angry i thought the actions of the ownership of that plant were despicable and i thought what congress should do is pass legislation that requires that notice be given to the workers then somewhere in the back of my mind i heard the voice of an old priest that used to rattle around the halls of i oras college in dubuque ia he said the road to hell is paved with good intentions i cannot mimic him very well but the fact of life is that in this case the road to hell is paved with good intentions we all want to help workers and some think that by passing this legislation we will but i suggest to my colleagues the opposite is true the fact is that when layoffs occur they usually occur because of a lost customer or they occur because of commodity price changes let us say the price of corn has gone up and the ethanol plant no longer has a market or maybe there is a new competitor the sponsors of the legislation say those are unforeseeable and we are not going to have a problem with that but the fact of life is that if notice is not given by those employers they are going to be in a position where they face litigation so the bottom line is that this bill prohibits a private employer from imposing a necessary partial layoff in order to save jobs for other workers and that is what is wrong with the legislation at its most basic but there is another thing that is wrong with it besides the fact that it costs jobs and that is that it is directed toward small businesses the large employers are already covered most of them by collectivebargaining contracts and the rest of them ladies and gentlemen will thumb their noses at this legislation look at what happens in canada the large companies every other week put in their paycheck a notice which says in 30 days or 60 days we will be closing down and it occurs week after week after wcek and they get around the bill but the smaller businesses are not sophisticated enough to do that so it provides no protection from the large but it hurts the small so i suggest to my colleagues if they want more plant closings vote for this bill

announce purchases of several million bushels of united states grain last tuesday the delegation visited lincoln ne as it visited other american cities and yesterday it was in washington dc as a member of congress who represents a large and important agricultural constituency i certainly appreciate their purchase of american grain however as this korean buying mission tours the united states and with great fanfare announcing purchases of grain i wish they would also explain why they have such a terrible protectionist policy affecting many other united states agricultural commodities and processed food productsfor example their barriers against the import of beef while i try not be cynical about the korean purchases i can only conclude that one reason for the high profile given thcse grain purchases is an attempt to hide their protectionist import policies toward a variety of agricultural and food products the worst example is their virtually total ban on highquality unitedstates beef which has been in effect since may 1985 in light of the korean trade surplus with the united states of 7 3 billion in 1986a 72 percent increase in 1 year over 1985we deserve better treatment and

nation in the world and its 1987 exports of 47 billion exceeded the total gnp of many other countries in the world currently the united states is by far its largest trading partner and korea is the seventh largest trading partner of the united states in recent years korean exports to the united states rose dramatically increasing at an average 20percent annual rate today approximately 40 percent of all korean exports go to the united statesthats right an incredible 40 percent of their total export market is found in our country koreas recent feed grain buying spree in the united states is surely designed in significant part to mute criticism of the fact that the united states share of the korean agricultural market had fallen to its lowest point in almost 20 years in regard to agricultural trade korea exported more than 41 million worth of processed foods and beverages to the united states this represents a doubling of sales over the past 5 years in contrast united states food and beverage sales to korea slipped from 19 million in 1982 to 18 million in 1986 in response to trade policy measu es designed to keep highvalue agricultural product imports to a minimum while promoting their exports there are small amounts of trade in the international interest but the trends are unfortunately significant we know however that a market exists in korea for united states food products by the fact that so much of it is being illegally sold out of a united states military post and base exchanges most of the discussion regarding united states beef exports has been focused on the expiration of the united statesjapanese agreement on their beef quotas however koreas outright ban on imported beef should be the initial focus of american policymakers and american people is it fair absolutely not and every american will recognize that when they know about the ban its outrageous in january 1987 we reached an understanding with the korean government that the united states would not file a gatt case against korea on beef in exchange for the korean govermnnts commitment to inprove access for other agricultuial products and a resumption of beef imports by the end of 1987 the government of korea has reneged theyve broken their promise to the cou try that is the destination of 40 percent of their total exports theyve broken their promise to the nation that ensures their security against north korea aggression the 1987 deadline has now passed and the market remains closedslammed shut this issue has been the subject of intense and protracted negotiations so far little progress has been made with no results the outcome of these discussions on removing the ban and the quota on beef will be a test of koreas commitment to open its markets resolving the agricultural trade issues will reassure skeptics in the american public and congress that the administration can ensure and the korean government will at long last really provide fair market access for american goods and services it is a test of whether the government of korea will keep its commitments if the administration cant demonstrate convincingly that market access can be achieved in countries which have very large trade surpluses with the united states the concerns of many americans about unfair trade practices among our international trading partners will grow and there will be that much less likelihood of removing the more extreme protectionst trade provisions from the omnibus trade bill which is currently in conference at this time a quite appropriate section 301 case regarding koreas treatment of the united states beef has been filed with the office of the united states special trade representative independently the ustp raised the issue lt a gatt dispute panel last week in geneva switzerland while the united states was assured or placated last year that some liberalization would occur once the korean presidential elections were concluded nothing substantive has been forthcoming from the koreans we are now being told that no action may be taken prior to the upcoming parliamentary elections in korea because united states beef exports would be a sensitive political issue quite frankly a total ban on united states beef is a sensitive issue here too i would remind the korean government that we have been patient too long what will be the next excuse for inaction that is offered it is time to set these political excuses aside unitedstates cattle producers have had enough the time for stonewalling and excuses is over i would encourage the ustr to accept the 301 case which it has pending and to proceed full speed in prosecuting the case korea is no longer an impoverished country it now has a responsibility to play fairly in the world trading environment which has enabled it to prosper in light of our huge trade deficit with korea it is not unreasonable to have open access to the korean market the elimination of koreas restrictions on united states beef would be an excellent start if protecting korean beef producers is politically sensitive they can do the same thing that the japanese should dodirectly subsidize their beef producers they can pay them and permit the korean and japanese consumers to reap the advantages of more highquality beef at much much lower prices again thank you korea for purchasing our grain but please be fair and live up to

the back of my mind i heard the voice of an old priest that used to rattle around the halls of i oras college in dubuque ia he said the road to hell is paved with good intentions i cannot mimic him very well but the fact of life is that in this case the road to hell is paved with good intentions we all want to help workers and some think that by passing this legislation we will but i suggest to my colleagues the opposite is true the fact is that when layoffs occur they usually occur because of a lost customer or they occur because of commodity price changes let us say the price of corn has gone up and the ethanol plant no longer has a market or maybe there is a new competitor the sponsors of the legislation say those are unforeseeable and we are not going to have a problem with that but the fact of life is that if notice is not given by those employers they are going to be in a position where they face litigation so the bottom line is that this bill prohibits a private employer from imposing a necessary partial layoff in order to save jobs for other workers and that is what is wrong with the legislation at its most basic but there is another thing that is wrong with it besides the fact that it costs jobs and that is that it is directed toward small businesses the large employers are already covered most of them by collectivebargaining contracts and the rest of them ladies

closing down and it occurs week after week after wcek and they get around the bill but the smaller businesses are not sophisticated enough to do that so it provides no protection from the large but it

and yesterday it was in washington dc as a member of congress who represents a large and important agricultural constituency i certainly appreciate their purchase of american grain however as this korean buying mission tours the united states and with great fanfare announcing purchases of grain i wish they would also explain why they have such a terrible protectionist policy affecting many other united states agricultural commodities and processed food productsfor example their barriers against the import of beef while i try not be cynical about the korean purchases i can only conclude that one reason for the high profile given thcse grain purchases is an attempt to hide their protectionist import policies toward a variety of agricultural and food products the worst example is their virtually total ban on highquality unitedstates beef which has been in effect since may 1985 in light of the korean trade surplus with the united states of 7 3 billion in 1986a 72 percent increase in 1 year over 1985we deserve better treatment and more access to korean markets open united states markets and the international trading system have worked well for korea and koreans havw benefited

far its largest trading partner and korea is the seventh largest trading partner of the united states in recent years korean exports to the united states rose dramatically increasing at an average 20percent annual rate today approximately 40 percent of all korean exports go to the united statesthats right an incredible 40 percent of their total export market is found in our country koreas recent feed grain buying spree in the united states is surely designed in significant part to mute criticism of the fact that the united states share of the korean agricultural market had fallen to its lowest point in almost 20 years in regard to agricultural trade korea exported more than 41 million worth of processed foods and beverages to the united states this represents a doubling of sales over the past 5 years in contrast united states food and beverage sales to korea slipped from 19 million in 1982 to 18 million in 1986 in response to trade policy measu es designed to keep highvalue agricultural product imports to a minimum while promoting their exports there are small amounts of trade in the international interest but the trends are unfortunately significant we know however that a market exists in korea for united states food products by the fact that so much of it is being illegally sold out of a united states military post and base exchanges most of the discussion regarding united states beef exports has been focused on the expiration of the united statesjapanese agreement on their beef quotas however koreas outright ban on imported beef should be the initial focus of american policymakers and american people is it fair absolutely not and every american will recognize that when they know about the ban its outrageous in january 1987 we reached an understanding with the korean government that the united states would not file a gatt case against korea on beef in exchange for the korean govermnnts commitment to inprove access for other agricultuial products and a resumption of beef imports by the end of 1987 the government of korea has reneged theyve broken their promise to the cou try that is the destination of 40 percent of their total exports theyve broken their promise to the nation that ensures their security against north korea aggression the 1987 deadline has now passed and the market remains closedslammed shut this issue has been the subject of intense and protracted negotiations so far little progress has been made with no results the outcome of these discussions on removing the ban and the quota on beef will be a test of koreas commitment to open its markets resolving the agricultural trade issues will reassure skeptics in the american public and congress that the administration can ensure and the korean government will at long last really provide fair market access for american goods and services it is a test of whether the government of korea will keep its commitments if the administration cant demonstrate convincingly that market access can be achieved in countries which have very large trade surpluses with the united states the concerns of many americans about unfair trade practices among our international trading

quite appropriate section 301 case regarding koreas treatment of the united states beef has been filed with the office of the united states special trade representative independently the ustp raised the issue lt a gatt dispute panel last week in geneva switzerland while the united states was assured or placated last year that some liberalization would occur once the korean presidential elections were concluded nothing substantive has been forthcoming from the koreans we are now being told that no action may be taken prior to the upcoming parliamentary elections in korea because united states beef exports would be a sensitive political issue quite frankly a total ban on united states beef is a sensitive issue here too i would remind the korean government that we have been patient too long what will be the next excuse for inaction that is offered it is time to set these political excuses aside unitedstates cattle producers have had enough the time for stonewalling and excuses is over i would encourage the ustr to accept the 301 case which it has pending and to proceed full speed in prosecuting the case korea is no longer an impoverished country it now has a responsibility to play fairly in the world trading environment which has enabled it to prosper in light of our huge trade deficit with korea it is not unreasonable to have open access to the korean market the elimination of koreas restrictions on united states beef would be an excellent start if protecting korean beef producers is politically sensitive they can do the same thing that the japanese should dodirectly subsidize their beef producers they can pay them and permit the korean and japanese consumers to reap the advantages of more highquality beef at much much lower prices again thank you korea for purchasing our grain but please be fair and live up to your promises to remove the beef ban as the first step in an immediate action to begin a speedy phaseout of beef quotas we appreciate your grain and soybean business but given your huge trade surplus with us we can and do expect to be your supplier of quality grain and soybeans at competitive pricesplus beef and a whole range of food productswhich your consumers would readily buy if given a chance"]]}
