of 2 26 billion bushels in 1979 while the 1941 legislation stimulated a rapid increase in production research and market development have been the second and third stage rockets which have given the soybean its meteoric rise to its present global orbit increasing new uses for soybean products through the years have provided a fertile field for the market development efforts which have caused sales to blossom around the world price support legislation was inspired early in 1941 by the war in europe and the immediate shortage of fats and oils in the united states which followed the japanese attack on pearl harbor the united states had been dependent on the pacific area for supplies of vegetable oils for soap paints and varnishes before world war ii the united states was importig twofifths of its fats and oils soybeans were not widely grown in this country although annual acreage had been increasing slowly for two decades less than 5 million acres of soybeans were harvested in 1940 even prior to pearl harbor official washington had become concerned about the impact of the growing war the reality of the situation caused a shift in attention from a policy of reducing the buildup of government stocks of several agricultural commoditiesnot soybeansto a policy seeking higher bngricultural production to meet wartime needs in conjunction with formulating a program for expanding agricultural production secretary of agriculture claude r wickard appointed interbureau coordinating committees for the basic commoditiescorn wheat cotton rice and tobacco an interbureau coordinating committee for fats and oils authorized on april 30 1941 recommended sponsoring a program calling for an expansion of soybean acreage on june 13 1941 agricultural conservation programs were announced to encourage increased production of soybeans for oil under the new provisions farmers were allowed to harvest an acreage larger than that harvested for soybeans in 1940 without penalties for exceeding acreage allotments ten days later farmers in states with minimum acreage requirements of soilconserving or erosionresisting crops received notice that soybeans harvested for beans for crushing were to be classified as an erosionresisting rather than soildepleting crop on july 1 1941 the steagall amendment was added to farm law raising the loan rates for basic commodities and directing usda to support the price at not less than 85percent parity on those nonbasic commodities including soybeans for oil for which the secretary of agriculture requested that production be increased thus the first government price support program for soybeans was inaugurated in 1941 on october 21 announcement was made of the first soybean price support loan to be offered by the commodity credit corporation nonrecourse loans were offered at a national average support level of 1 05 per bushel which was equal to 81 percent of comparable parity at the time of the support announcement the average farm price for soybeans was about 1 20 per bushel at the end of the 194142 marketing year the average farm price received for soybeans equalled 1 55 per bushel the 149 000 bushels placed under price support loans were redeemed before the end of the season soybean oil production increased from 564 million pounds in 1940 to 707 million pounds in 1941 in december 1941 price ceilings were placed on soybeans and were continued until the end of world war ii with the unitedstates entry into world war ii the need for a large increase in domestic oil production became even greater and the expansion of soybean production appeared to be the most feasible means of achieving this end in addition to the support prices the government established production goals starting with the 1942 crop the price support provision for the steagall commodites was raised from a floor of 85percent of parity to not less than 90 percent to remain in effect until 2 years after the termination of hostilities production during the war years more than doubledfrom 78 million bushels in 1940 to 193 million bushels in 1945 the price of soybeans during world war ii was contoiled within a rather narrow range by the price floor afforded by the support loan program and ceiling prices first on consumer products and later on raw agricultural products no acreage allotments or marketing quotas have ever been used to restrict the production of soybeans however federal programs for corn feed grains wheat and cotton often have included crosscompliance provisions applying to

fourth decade of legislative life of the soybean price support programa program devised originally to stimulate production but which successfully has avoided the tighter governmental control applied to other major crops over these 40 years the production of soybeans in the united states has grown a crop of around 78 million bushels in 1940 to the alltime record crop of 2 26 billion bushels in 1979 while the 1941 legislation stimulated a rapid increase in production research and market development have been the second and third stage rockets which have given the soybean its meteoric rise to its present global orbit increasing new uses for soybean products through the years have provided a fertile field for the market development efforts which have caused sales to blossom around the world price support legislation was inspired early in 1941 by the war in europe and the immediate shortage of fats and oils in the united states which followed the japanese attack on pearl harbor the united states had been dependent on the pacific area for supplies of vegetable oils for soap paints and varnishes before world war ii the united states was importig twofifths of its fats and oils soybeans were not widely grown in this country although annual acreage had been increasing slowly for two decades less than 5 million acres of soybeans were harvested in 1940 even prior to pearl harbor official washington had become concerned about the impact of the growing war the reality of the situation caused a shift in attention from a policy of reducing the buildup of government stocks of several agricultural commoditiesnot soybeansto a policy seeking higher bngricultural production to meet wartime needs in conjunction with formulating a program for expanding agricultural production secretary of agriculture claude r wickard appointed interbureau coordinating committees for the basic commoditiescorn wheat cotton rice and tobacco an interbureau coordinating committee for fats and oils authorized on april 30 1941 recommended sponsoring a program calling for an expansion of soybean acreage on june 13 1941 agricultural conservation programs were announced to encourage increased production of soybeans for oil under the new provisions farmers were allowed to harvest an acreage larger than that harvested for soybeans in 1940 without penalties for exceeding acreage allotments ten days later farmers in states with minimum acreage requirements of soilconserving or erosionresisting crops received notice that soybeans harvested for beans for crushing were to be classified as an erosionresisting rather than soildepleting crop on july 1 1941 the steagall amendment was added to farm law raising the loan rates for basic commodities and directing usda to support the price at not less than 85percent parity on those nonbasic commodities including soybeans for oil for which the secretary of agriculture requested that production be increased thus the first government price support program for soybeans was inaugurated in 1941 on october 21 announcement was made of the first soybean price support loan to be offered by the commodity credit corporation nonrecourse loans were offered at a national average support level of 1 05 per bushel which was equal to 81 percent of comparable parity at the time of the support announcement the average farm price for soybeans was about 1 20 per bushel at the end of the 194142 marketing year the average farm price received for soybeans equalled 1 55 per bushel the 149 000 bushels placed under price support loans were redeemed before the end of the season soybean oil production increased from 564 million pounds in 1940 to 707 million pounds in 1941 in december 1941 price ceilings were placed on soybeans and were continued until the end of world war ii with the unitedstates entry into world war ii the need for a large increase in domestic oil production became even greater and the expansion of soybean production appeared to be the most feasible means of achieving this end in addition to the support prices the government established production goals starting with the 1942 crop the price support provision for the steagall commodites was raised from a floor of 85percent of parity to not less than 90 percent to remain in effect until 2 years after the termination of hostilities production during the war years more than doubledfrom 78 million bushels in 1940 to 193 million bushels in 1945 the price of soybeans during world war ii was contoiled within a rather narrow range by the price floor afforded by the support loan program and ceiling prices first on consumer products and later on raw agricultural products no acreage allotments or marketing quotas have ever been used to restrict the production of soybeans however federal programs for corn feed grains wheat and cotton often have included crosscompliance provisions applying to soybeans farmers participating in these programs

on this date the us government officially recognized the three baltic republics of estonia lithuania and latvia these baltic states had been independent for approximately 4 years and the united states felt in 1922 that it was time to welcome estonia lithuania and latvia into the international arena from that moment in 1922 these new nations achieved even greater legitimacy and established a firm basis for their right to exist these small countries when grouped together occupy about the same amount of territory as new england yet they have given the world much through their culture and knowledge and will continue to do so in the future when the baltic states first became independent they were constantly under pressure from their two powerful and aggressive neighbors germany and russia estonia lithuania and latvia were the object of many political quarrels between the two huge countries nearby who fought over the natural resources available in the area eventually as everyone here tonight knows the russians entered the baltic states and took control of the governments at that time the many balts who protested were arrested sent out ot the country or killed here in the united states it is difficult to realize how hard the struggle for freedom has been for the baltic people but we cannot forget that not long ago we americans were oppressed by colonial overlords however with some assistance from friendly nations we carried through a revolution and established our freedom as the united states of america thus it is incumbent on us to vocally support those people whose nations have been forcibly invaded and occupied the inhumane actions of the soviet union cannot be legitimized simply by waiting for the nations of the west to forget all about the baltic states for that reason we have introduced a resolution in the house house resolution 526 which reaffirms the unitedstates recognition of the baltic states in 1922 fortyfour members of the house have cosponsored this resolution and i am confident that many more will do so in the near future when this measure is passed by the house of representatives it will send a strong signal to the soviet union

over two decades what happened to them is the history of all nonrussian states within the unitedstatess r a history of brutal expansionism and tyranical oppression in 1940 the soviet union forcibly and unlawfully incorporated latvia within its domain and set out systematically to destroy the countrys national cultural linguistic and religious integrity to accomplish this they practiced every tactic of terrorism imprisonment exile torture and murder it is out of outrage for this barbarous injustice that the united states along with other great western powers steadfastly maintains a policy of nonrecognition of the forcible annexation of latvia a national independence day is supposed to be a time of celebration so what do we have to celebrate latvia is still a captive nation the baltic freedom fighters who for years waged guerrilla warfare in the face of impossible odds have finally been crushed all dissident activities have been driven underground and the people of latvia are daily denied the elemental rights of human beings so what do we have to celebrate we have the fact that despite unrelenting oppression the latvians fierce love of liberty and commitment to national identity has not diminished by one jot their experience should remind us how privileged we are to live in the free world and should spur us to help people everywhere who are struggling against persecution i am

federal outlays exceeded 500 billion in fiscal year 1980 600 billion in fiscal year 1981 and are projected to exceed 700 billion in fiscal year 1982 if this is not enough to convince the members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment

the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congessmen who support it a similar process and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely noticeable but when the costs of all the programs are added the impact is severe the requirements of balancing the budget and limiting the growth in spending will give the taxpayers an qual opportunity to influence spending discussions through the ballot box under the balancedbudget amendment congressmen will be forced to remain aware of public opinion because the votes for deficit spending and tax increases will be voted directly on those issues this should result in an examination of priorities when programs are considered the spending limitation will force congress to make choices which should lead to more efficient government the american people are demanding that congress balance the budget today we have the opportunity to carry out the will of the people and this is one congressman who will be voting to support the people of this country it is clear that the american budget process is seriously

american system the elimination or sharp reduction in deficit spending and the limitation on spending will reduce inflationary monetary policies and allocate more financial resources to the private
