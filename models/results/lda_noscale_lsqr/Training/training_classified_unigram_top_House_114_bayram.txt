billiondollar surplus bill the government takeover of our health care and the massive new regulations put on small businesses but more importantly i fought for the people of my district so that their voice would be heard and respected by my colleagues for i heard that voice in every vote that i have cast but i also knew that being in the majority was key to making a difference so i am proud of the work i have done to contribute to a republican majority here in congressto begin to scale back the overreaches of a bloated federal government and to begin to bend the curve on outofcontrol spending that has only happened because of a republican majority and i am proud to have played a role in building it during this time i saw how slow the federal government can be and how frustrating congress can get but i also learned that one man can make a difference working with my republican colleagues and across the aisle with my democrat friends we have been able to pass legislation that helped businesses across america create millions of jobs some of them have been located in my home district but many more across this great country there was is and will be so much to do and i am honored to have played a small part in making a real difference but these accomplishments come with some frustrations as well that this body doesnt move quickly enough or as efficiently as it could to confront the challenges facing our country i regret that i wont be here when we finally pass a smarter simpler tax code so that every hardworking taxpayer in my district and across the country will know that washington not only cares about them but respects them and their sacrifice and i will miss joining my colleagues in saving and strengthening social security and medicare that will directly improve the quality of life for millions of americans for generations to come to my constituents back home the good hardworking taxpayers whom i have been lucky enough to call friends i will never be able to thank you enough for the opportunity you have given me to serve together we have tackled some of the big problems at home like economic development projects helping businesses expand improving our locks and dams along our riverways and so much more projects that have helped improve the quality of life in our community we have also tackled some small problems but big problems to the people who have been facing themfolks looking for help adopting children overseas or simply trying to get answers from an unresponsive bureaucracy here in d c solving those individual cases has been extremely fulfilling i am particularly grateful to have played a role in helping so many veterans get the respect they deserve and the benefits that they earned i am proud of the good work that my team has delivered to the tens of thousands of constituents who have turned to our office in their time in need my staff delivered for me because they delivered for you every day 24 7 i was never more excited than the day i walked into this chamber 6 years ago i leave here with sadness and humility for those whom i have let down i will work tirelessly to make it up to you i know that god has a plan for my life the good book tells us that before i formed you in the womb i knew you i also know that every person faces adversity in life abraham lincoln held this seat in congress for one term but few faced as many defeats in his personal business and public life as he did his continual perseverance in the face of these trials never giving up is something all of us americans should be inspired by especially when going through a valley in life i believe that through lifes struggles we learn from our mistakes and we learn more about ourselves and i know that this is not the end of a story but rather the beginning of a new chapter thank you for the honor to serve i look forward to keeping in touch with my friends in this chamber and my friends across the 18th district may god continue to bless this awesome institution and the important role that it plays for america and the rest of the world with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "820 miles of the border from san antonio to el paso i would like to thank the gentlewoman for the time today and also for taking me to your district and seeing that part of the border our trip a few weeks ago was great enlightening to me i have spent a lot of time crisscrossing those 820 miles of the border and it was great to see how the san diego sector and tucson and my fellow texans in mcallen are doing the same thing as the gentlewoman knows i spent 9 years as an undercover officer in the cia i chased groups like al qaeda and the taliban i have chased narcotraffickers all over the world and the threat is increasing and the threat is sophisticated the drug trafficking organizations in mexico are making 50 billion a year in the united states that is a big number their tactics techniques and procedures are sophisticated and we need to keep up it is about moves and countermoves what i like about this bill is it empowers our members of border patrol to do their job a lot of people talk about border security i like to refine it a little bit part of it is interdiction stopping people before they get to the border it is grabbing them it is having them in custody and then it is removal this bill is focused on this first piece of border security which is interdiction we need to make sure that our men and women that are on the border every single day have the tools that they need in order to do their job it is different in tucson it is different in eagle pass it is different in san diego what i like about this bill that was developed under the leadership of chairman mccaul is that it gives them that freedom and flexibility having spent a lot of time overseas i know the disconnect between the field and headquarters and that is going on right here on our border we need to make sure that the guys and gals that are on the border have the tools that they need this is a sophisticated threat as you alluded to using ultralight aircraft to deliver their payload they are using tactics that intelligence organizations have used all across the world to do denial and deception we need to make sure we have all the resourcesthings like the aerostats things like radar technology things like uavsin order to have that combined picture of the border this is something that for 19 months i talked to folks in the district i know like you this was a very important issue the american people sent us up here to do our job and our job is to protect our citizens and to protect our homeland this bill does it it is a strong bill and i look forward to working over these next few days and weeks in order to make this happen"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a costbenefit analysis prior to the implementation of a regulation requires a number of assumptions that make an accurate analysis difficult if not impossible h r 50 allows committee chairmen and ranking members to ask for the retrospective reviews of specific regulations i think there needs to be a degree of deference and some respect for the idea that it is for committee chairmen and ranking members both sides of the aisle not just based on some whim i think it is offensive to suggest that it be just some whimsical thing this allows an important check on any preimplementation costbenefit analysis and these retrospective reviews better clarify the true costs of regulation even president obama supports retrospective reviews and issued an executive order requiring agencies to conduct them more importantly retrospective reviews work in april of 2014 the gao issued a report on retrospective reviews at 22 executive agencies that report found that more than 90 percent of retrospective regulation reviews led the agencies to revise clarify or eliminate regulation text90 percent however the pace of retrospective review is much slower than planned and the 22 agencies reviewed by the gao had plans to conduct more than 650 retrospective reviews but had only completed 246 of them as of august of as you can see the agencies are already doing this work it is good to go back and review we shouldnt be afraid of that we should encourage it this provision in the bill simply allows congress to work with agencies to prioritize regulatory areas most important to the american taxpayer we need to maintain the ability to make such requests and i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a few weeks ago i had the pleasure of going to the 50th anniversary commemoration of the vietnam war in little rock and to see all the hugs and emotion at that event truly it was a tumultuous time in our world it was so good to see the healing that those men and women experienced at that 50th anniversary i looked at that table set for the pow mia ceremony and of course i was thinking about sergeant harold george bennett from perryville arkansas sergeant bennett was born on october 16 1940 in thornburg arkansas a very small town outside the beautiful ouachita national forest a graduate of perryville high school he enlisted in the unitedstates army in 1957 he served as an airborne infantryman with the 82nd and 101st airborne divisionsno finer units he completed special forces training in 1963 from there sergeant bennett volunteered to go to south vietnam as a special forces adviser with the military assistance command on december 29 1964 his unit was airlifted to a small village after it had been overrun by the viet cong upon landing sergeant bennetts unit was confronted by enemy forces twice he refused extraction by military helicopters as he was concerned for the pilots safety and wanted to continue the fight against the enemy after a furious and courageous battle sergeant bennett was taken prisoner by the viet cong like so many of his colleagues he spent 179 days as a pow and attempted to escape three times at great risk his captors executed him on june 25 1965 only 24 years old sergeant bennett was the first american pow killed in vietnam and like so many other servicemen who lost their lives there his remains have never returned home"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a lot of this is talk and with due respect to my friend from colorado i hear the point but i would say a lot of that is we are hearing we we this we this we the federal we this it really should be we the people at the state we the people at the local level it is important that we get some of the power that we like to monger up here among us in this house to return it back to the states to return it back to the individual school boards who best knows to make these decisions other than these parents and these school boards we talk about accountability as dr phil would say how has that been working for us the last 40 years we need to get the accountability back to where it goes where
