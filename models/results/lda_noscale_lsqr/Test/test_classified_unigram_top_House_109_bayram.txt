carriers were discontinuing the sale of medical liability insurance but because too many physicians felt forced to leave their practice leave their specialty or leave the state for a more affordable state but 10 years ago in wisconsin we figured out a reasonable answer i led the fight to create a new medical liability system where injured parties receive every single dollar of economic damages to which they are entitled but where there is a modest cap on noneconomic damages things like pain and suffering loss of society loss of companionship you know what it worked we hear a lot about studies here we know as a fact in wisconsin it worked in a short period of time wisconsin became one of only six states not to have a medical liability crisis as a result as the state medical society reported physicians especially those in highrisk specialties actually moved into our state from states like ohio and pennsylvania and florida and illinois it worked but sadly my state recently lost its way even though by any reasonable measure our reforms work the wisconsin courts struck them down we can only hope that wisconsin enacts a new medical liability reform act but until then we should pass the health act it will not only help wisconsin doctors and patients but those in every state facing a medical liability crisis this bill is statefriendly it does not preempt state reforms if a state like wisconsin has a cap on noneconomic damages whether that cap is higher or lower that cap will take effect more important it is doctorfriendly it is patientfriendly it will help us get a handle on at least a small portion of our health care costs it will encourage doctors to continue to practice in vital specialties and it will attack defensive medicine i urge support for the health act"], [0.0,

their health costs their education costs and their social services costs but now it is becoming illegal for illegals to get these services that even many americans do not receive taxpayers are finding their own answers while some federal lawmakers in washington remain deaf to their desire because they are too busy dueling over illegal immigration doctrines state leaders are stepping in across the couhtry just this week in colorado lawmakers took a cue from their citizens by cutting through the conflict and passed 11 bipartisan bills taking a tougher stance on illegal entry just like houston illegals have been drawn to colorado like moths to a flame and like many states colorado has left the porch light on for them because they have bad laws that encourage illegal entry such as laws that protect employers that hire illegals providing illegals benefits that many americans do not receive such as unemployment grants and even medical care this may explain why half of colorados immigrants are illegal but those days may be over because now state legislators are aiming to flip the switch and turn out the lights and turn off the benefits that make being illegal so lucrative this week they passed 11 immigration bills including making people prove that they are legal residents of colorado in order to receive state and federal benefits that is a farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom line those businesses who exploit

in our administration and today i would like to talk about one aspect of national security that will probably be unknown to a great many americans and to those few who know about and have studied it this will remind them of the potential for this threat to our country indeed to our whole society our first glimpse of the possibility of this threat occurred in 1961 it was in the pacific and we were then doing a series of nuclear tests and this was our first and last high altitude test it was over johnston island and the weapon was detonated above the atmosphere the first time that we had done that no one knew what was going to happen as a result of that test and the consequences were unexpected and really quite striking hawaii was about 800 miles away if you think back to 1961 we did not have all of the electronics that we have today we were more in an electrical infrastructure then than we were in an electronic infrastructure and the electrical infrastructures are very much more robust than an electronic infrastructure because you are dealing with big structures and heavy wires and so forth even so the effects of this detonation above the atmosphere resulted in the shutdown of electrical circuits there were many disruptions in electrical and certainly in electronic equipment such as existed those days in hawaii 800 miles away the soviets were also doing testing simultaneously with ours and they had more experience with this phenomenon we now have a name for this phenomenon we call it electromagnetic pulse or emp and here i have a chart which shows very schematically what is happening we detonate the weapon above the atmosphere and there is an immediate distribution of gamma rays that travel at the speed of light that will strike every object within line of sight and when these gamma rays reach our atmosphere they produce what is called compton electrons all of this essentially at the speed of light and these compton electrons then become a force which is very much like a nuclear storm magnified many many times and if you think of the disruptions that a robust solar storm can produce to our communications here you can get some idea as to the potential impact of an emp it is sometimes called high altitude or hemp we sinc6 have learned a great deal more about that than we knew then but the feature that we learned then was that wide areas are affected you can have very high field strengths and here it says 50 kilovolts per meter we have since learned as reported by the russian generals and i will come to that report in a few moments that the soviets purportedly designed and built electromagnetic weapons that would produce 200 kilovolts per meter so that is four times larger than the number which is given here in this chart this was may of 1986 that was 20some years after the explosion but a long time before these russian generals were interviewed there is a very broad frequency band running from very very short wavelengths to very long wavelengths the pulse lasts more than 2 minutes but it comes on with such abruptness that our surge protectors for your computer and other devices are useless because the pulse is through the surge protector before it sees it so there is now nothing out there the equivalent of emp the next chart shows on the right that just about everything is affected by emp it has a missile which is taking off there we are not even sure that we can launch through a robust emp laydown what i am told is that we tested our missiles and we found some deficiencies and we corrected that and we have done that several times and the last time we corrected the defi ciencies we intentionally did not test again hoping that we had fixed all the deficiencies but knowing that if we tested and found deficiencies that that intelligence would probably get out to our enemies and they would know that we were vulnerable and rather than run that risk we believe that we had corrected all the deficiencies so we have not tested and hopefully a potential enemy will also believe that we have corrected all the deficiencies but that is not a certainty we do not yet know for certain that we could launch our ballistic missiles through an emp laydown it shows effects on automobiles by the way if you have a car or truck that has a coil and a distributor you are probably immune to emp but all modern cars as you know when you take your car for service has a lot of computers indeed a computer is required for servicing your car so all of the new vehicles are vulnerable to emp airplanes only a few of our military airplanes are emp hardened all of the other planes are vulnerable to emp effects here on the left it shows the coverage with the height of blast 60 miles and how large an area that is line of sight with the simple geometry of the earth and the height if you are 200 miles up you cover a bigger area and if you are 300 miles high up with the center of that in iowa nebraska about in that area it covers our whole country or the margins of our country in south florida northwest washington state and maine all are covered with a blast of about 300 miles high above nebraska or iowa the next chart is a little more detailed presentation of the blast area and it shows that it is not simple concentric rings because of the dynamics of thedetonation of a nuclear weapon you have a distribution of intensities but generally speaking out at the margins of the country with 480 kilometers about 300 miles with a detonation of that blast you see from the purplehere that you have got about 50 percent of maximum at the margins of our country the level to which we tested is classified but if the russian generals are correct that they developed weapons at 200 kilovolts per meter that would mean 100 kilovolts per meter at the margins of our country and there is concern that even when we test and harden that we may not have hardened it to an adequate level the next chart answers an important question that i am sure a lot of people ask at about this point and that is if there is such enormous vulnerability to emp why would you be talking about that and giving our potential adversaries a heads up that we are vulnerable to help understand that most americans may not know about it but every one of our potential enemies knows about it i have here just one little chart which as you can see is not in english it is in russian as a matter of fact and although i cannot read russian i certainly can l6ok at the sketches here and what we see is emp e 1730 here is a weapon detonated above the atmosphere and here you see the effect of that this is the emp pulse here lasting a long time by the way the fact that the wavelengths in that pulse go from extremely short to extremely long mean that they can couple with almost everything i am told that the smallest electronic parts on the warehouse shelf will couple with some of the shortest waves and long long lines like railroad tracks will couple with the longest waves as a matter of fact they will even couple with wires that are buried several feet underground without technical knowledge what we are talking about almost seems like buck rogers and science fiction a blast of a single weapon up to 300 miles in the sky and by the way if it were in the daytime and you were looking away from it you would not even know it happened if you were looking at it obviously you would see it because it was very bright and it was line of sight you are not hurt by it it has no effect on our bodies but if you have an electronic watch that will stop if you get in your car that probably will not run the phones will not work there will be no power grid there are literally tens of thousands of what are called scada which are little control devices in our power grid and they all contain chips microelectronics and many of them were manufactured by organizations that do not even exist now because they have been in the field for a long time and all of those are gone signals traveling through fiber will get there but if you have anything other than optical switching if you have electronic switching the switches will be gone and so even if you are using fiber you still cannot transmit your data if you are using otherthanoptical switching so this chart demonstrates very clearly that our enemies know about emp because this is from a russian publication and it shows the effects of emp this is the power grid they show the transformers going out by the way if our big transformers go out there are no replacements on the shelf the biggest ones are not even manufactured in this country we will need to go to europe or scandinavia and you place your order and in a year to 18 months they will have the transformer for you i was concerned about emp and i called a friend of mine tom clancy who i knew had an emp scenario in one of his books and he lives on the eastern shore of maryland i knew him so i called tom and asked him for some information on emp he said if you have read my book you know as much about emp as i know but let me refer you to in his opinion the smartest man hired by the unitedstates government and he gave me the name of a dr lowell wood who worked for lawrence livermore lab one of our big nuclear labs out in california well this was back oh probably 12 13 years ago a while ago and cell phones were not all that popular you may remember that we were using pagers if you wanted to communicate with someone why you paged them and that went up to a satellite and back down to their pager and they got the little message please call so and so i did that with lowell wood i thought he was in california and he happened to be in washington andof course the same satellite that would have brought the signal down to california brought it down to washington within an hour he was sitting with me in my office dr lowell wood was indeed afont of knowledge on electromagnetic pulse i was concerned that because of cost considerations that our military was waiving emp hardening on essentially all of its new weapons systems and that that made us vulnerable to an emp attack and so i got in legislation the establishment of an emp commission and the emp commission was set up and functioned for 2 years normally our commissions work for a year but because of the details of this legislation they were able to work for 2 years they brought forth a big report this is the executive summary of that report and this was issued in 2004 this is the executive summary of the report of the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse emp attack and here are a number of powerpoint presentations that they prepared because they were going around the country briefing a large number of organizations federal and state and private on the results of their study the next chart shows the commissioners here you will see dr johnnie foster is the developer of almost all of our new atomic weapons dr bill graham who was the chair of this was rumsfelds cochair when they did that very important study on the emerging ballistic missile threat that came out a few years ago it is interesting i spent a couple of days in moscow with bill graham and rumsfeld when we were briefing members of the russian duma so that they would understand that our withdrawal from this treaty that prohibited us from protecting ourselves against intercontinental ballistic missiles had nothing to do with russia because we cannot imagine that we could produce a robust enough protection system to protect us against the literally thousands of intercontinental ballistic missiles that russia has but there are some new players on the scene out there like china and north korea and iran and who knows who may get in line and we could we felt with the development of a system the successful test just a few days ago be able to take out a few weapons from a country like this another very important member of this commission was dr joan woodward who is the deputy director of the sandia labs out in albuquerque new mexico i was out visiting my son there who works at the labs and he brought me home some material from the lab that led me to believe that they might have some knowledge that would be helpful in this emp study so i asked for a briefing i had not looked at the list and remembered specifically who was on this list of commissioners and i came in for a 5hour classified briefing on the commissions work and dr joan woodward had at her disposal all of the resources of the sandia labs so they did a really magnificent job of studying the threat not just to our military but to our national infrastructure the next chart shows something which alarmed them this is from their commission report we have redacted here the names of the russian generals but they interviewed two russian generals who told them that russia had designed and built a super emp nuclear weapon capable of generating 200 kilovolts per meter that is an enormously high pulse russian chinese and pakistani scientists are working in north korea now i am not saying this i am taking this from the report of the emp commission russian chinese and pakistani scientists are working in north korea and could enable that country to develop an emp weapon in the near future now this is the assessment of the emp commission the next chart just builds on the point that i made that most of our citizens may not know anything about emp because it is really a buck rogers star wars kind of a phenomena it almost seems like science fiction the fact is that although few of our people know about emp all of our potential enemies know about emp and i just wanted to make that very clear because i do not want anybody to have the notion that we are somehow informing a potential enemy of something that he does not know about this first quote here is a very interesting one this is not exactly the quote as i remember but it is a pretty h6354 co good paraphrase because i was there it was may 2nd of 1999 and i was sitting in a hotel in vienna austria with ten other members of our congress and three members of the russian duma i can tell you exactly when we were there we were there when the three prisoners hostages whatever you want to call them were released by yugoslavia you may remember that event they were released to jesse jackson as you may remember for 2 days we sat in that hotel room hammering out a framework for an agreement five days later that was voted by the g8 russia joined the g7 because the only country that the bosnians had enough respect for to be controlled by them was russia and when the g7 joined with russia they used the framework agreement that we had developed and that ended the hostilities there as you may remember well one of the three russians there was vladimir lukin he was the ambassador here at the end of bush 1 the beginning of the clinton administration at the time we were there he was the chair of their equivalent of our international relations committee in the russian duma he is a fairly short fellow with even shorter arms and he was extremely angry and he sat there for 2 days with his arms folded across his chest looking at the ceiling and then he made this statement and what he said was as i remember it if we really wanted to hurt you with no threat of retaliation we would launch an slbm and we would detonate a nuclear weapon high above your country and shut down your power grid and your communications for 6 months or so that was vladimir lukin another russian who was there who was i think the third ranking communist and yes there is still a big communist party in russia who was the third ranking communist alexander shurbanov and he smiled and he said if one weapon would not do it we have some spares like i think at least 7 000 spares you see the reason for no fear of retaliation was that if it was launched from the ocean we would never know where it came from well that was his comment now all of this is from the emp commission none of those are my statements chinese military writings describe emp as the key to victory and describe scenarios where emp is used against unitedstates aircraft carriers in a conflict over taiwan again a survey of worldwide military and scientific literature sponsored by the commission found widespread knowledge about emp and its potential military utility including in taiwan israel egypt india pakistan iran and north korea this next bullet is

have met with general newbold in my office a couple of times i am very impressed with this gentleman and his integrity and his honesty and i want to read just a couple of paragraphs from a time magazine article it is entitled why iraq was a mistake a military insider sounds off against the war and the zealots who pushed it this article is not written by a reporter for time magazine this article was written by lieutenant general greg newbold retired and i just want to read a couple of paragraphs because i think he makes such a great point again this article is april 9 2006 i met with him in my office in may of this year this is paragraph one of two i want to read for the record from 2000 until october 2002 i was a marine corps lieutenant general and director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff after 9 11 i was a witness and therefore a party to the action that led us to the invasion of iraq an unnecessary war inside the military family i made no secret of my view that the zealots rationale for war made no sense and i think i was outspoken enough to make those senior to me uncomfortable but i now regret that i did not more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were peripheral to the real threat al qaeda i retired from the military 4 months before the invasion in part because of my opposition to those who had used 9 11s tragedy to hijack our security policy until now i have resisted speaking out in public ive been silent long enough i mention that before i read the last paragraph i had the pleasure as i said earlier to meet with general newbold in may of this year i had the pleasure of hearing him speak today and he is a man of great integrity like the majority of all of those in our military he was on the inside before we went to war in iraq he heard the planning was part of the planning and as he said to us today he said you know when we first had our meeting after september 11 we were told to develop a strategy for afghanistan and then the next time we have our meeting we are asked where is the plan for iraq this is i think such an important part that he writes members of congress from both parties defaulted in fulfilling their constitutional responsibility for oversight many in the media saw the warning signs and heard cautionary tales before the invasion from wise observers like former central command chiefs joe hoar and tony zinni but gave insufficient weight to their views these are the same news organizations that now downplay both the heroic and the constructive in iraq i mention this because i think we fn congress to meet our constitutional duties do have a responsibility for oversight i would think and hope that my party as well as the other party would want to know how did we get into iraq was the intelligence verified time after time time after time before we committed our troops to iraq i think that we should know in fairness to democracy a democracy will not stand without truth being told so i hope that my side as well as the other side would come together and let us hold hearings i have actually asked the chairman of armed services to bring in general newbold general zinni and general baptiste and bring them in to the armed services committee for hearings even if it was a classified or a closed hearing because we in congress in both parties should be asking these questions i will close by saying that again it has been a pleasure that i would have the privilege to hear general newbold today at lunchtime he reiterated things he had said to me back in may to about 10 of my colleagues and i do hope that we need not to make the same mistake in future wars we need to make sure that the congress is informed and informed with credible evidence from

them because they have bad laws that encourage illegal entry such as laws that protect employers that hire illegals providing illegals benefits that many americans do not receive such as unemployment grants and even medical care this may explain why half of colorados immigrants are illegal but those days may be over because now state legislators are aiming to flip the switch and turn out the lights and turn off the benefits that make being illegal so lucrative this week they passed 11 immigration bills including making people prove that they are legal residents of colorado in order to receive state and federal benefits that is a farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding

preeminent today in the minds of many people and in the congress and in our administration and today i would like to talk about one aspect of national security that will probably be unknown to a great many americans and to those few who know about and have studied it this will remind them of the potential for this threat to our country indeed to our whole society our first glimpse of the possibility of this threat occurred in 1961 it was in the pacific and we were then doing a series of nuclear tests and this was our first and last high altitude test it was over johnston island and the weapon was detonated above the atmosphere the first time that we had done that no one knew what was going to happen as a result of that test and the consequences were unexpected and really quite striking hawaii was about 800 miles away if you think back to 1961 we did not have all of the electronics that we have today we were more in an electrical infrastructure then than we were in an electronic infrastructure and the electrical infrastructures are very much more robust than an electronic infrastructure because you are dealing with big structures and heavy wires and so forth even so the effects of this detonation above the atmosphere resulted in the shutdown of electrical circuits there were many disruptions in electrical and certainly in electronic equipment such as existed those days in hawaii 800 miles away the soviets were also doing testing simultaneously with ours and they had more experience with this phenomenon we now have a name for this phenomenon we call it electromagnetic pulse or emp and here i have a chart which shows very schematically what is happening we detonate the weapon above the atmosphere and there is an immediate distribution of gamma rays that travel at the speed of light that will strike every object within line of sight and when these gamma rays reach our atmosphere they produce what is called compton electrons all of this essentially at the speed of light and these compton electrons then become a force which is very much like a nuclear storm magnified many many times and if you think of the disruptions that a robust solar storm can produce to our communications here you can get some idea as to the potential impact of an emp it is sometimes called high altitude or hemp we sinc6 have learned a great deal more about that than we knew then but the feature that we learned then was that wide areas are affected you can have very high field strengths and here it says 50 kilovolts per meter we have since learned as reported by the russian generals and i will come to that report in a few moments that the soviets purportedly designed and built electromagnetic weapons that would produce 200 kilovolts per meter so that is four times larger than the number which is given here in this chart this was may of 1986 that was 20some years after the explosion but a long time before these russian generals were interviewed there is a very broad frequency band running from very very short wavelengths to very long wavelengths the pulse lasts more than 2 minutes but it comes on with such abruptness that our surge protectors for your computer and other devices are useless because the pulse is through the surge protector before it sees it so there is now nothing out there the equivalent of emp the next chart shows on the right that just about everything is affected by emp it has a missile which is taking off there we are not even sure that we can launch through a robust emp laydown what i am told is that we tested our missiles and we found some deficiencies and we corrected that and we have done that several times and the last time we corrected the defi ciencies we intentionally did not test again hoping that we had fixed all the deficiencies but knowing that if we tested and found deficiencies that that intelligence would probably get out to our enemies and they would know that we were vulnerable and rather than run that risk we believe that we had corrected all the deficiencies so we have not tested and hopefully a potential enemy will also believe that we have corrected all the deficiencies but that is not a certainty we do not yet know for certain that we could launch our ballistic missiles through an emp laydown it shows effects on automobiles by the way if you have a car or truck that has a coil and a distributor you are probably immune to emp but all modern cars as you know when you take your car for service has a lot of computers indeed a computer is required for servicing your car so all of the new vehicles are vulnerable to emp airplanes only a few of our military airplanes are emp hardened all of the other planes are vulnerable to emp effects here on the left it shows the coverage with the height of blast 60 miles and how large an area that is line of sight with the simple geometry of the earth and the height if you are 200 miles up you cover a bigger area and if you are 300 miles high up with the center of that in iowa nebraska about in that area it covers our whole country or the margins of our country in south florida northwest washington state and maine all are covered with a blast of about 300 miles high above nebraska or iowa the next chart is a little more detailed presentation of the blast area and it shows that it is not simple concentric rings because of the dynamics of thedetonation of a nuclear weapon you have a distribution of intensities but generally speaking out at the margins of the country with 480 kilometers about 300 miles with a detonation of that blast you see from the purplehere that you have got about 50 percent of maximum at the margins of our country the level to which we tested is classified but if the russian generals are correct that they developed weapons at 200 kilovolts per meter that would mean 100 kilovolts per meter at the margins of our country and there is concern that even when we test and harden that we may not have hardened it to an adequate level the next chart answers an important question that i am sure a lot of people ask at about this point and that is if there is such enormous vulnerability to emp why would you be talking about that and giving our potential adversaries a heads up that we are vulnerable to help understand that most americans may not know about it but every one of our potential enemies knows about it i have here just one little chart which as you can see is not in english it is in russian as a matter of fact and although i cannot read russian i certainly can l6ok at the sketches here and what we see is emp e 1730 here is a weapon detonated above the atmosphere and here you see the effect of that this is the emp pulse here lasting a long time by the way the fact that the wavelengths in that pulse go from extremely short to extremely long mean that they can couple with almost everything i am told that the smallest electronic parts on the warehouse shelf will couple with some of the shortest waves and long long lines like railroad tracks will couple with the longest waves as a matter of fact they will even couple with wires that are buried several feet underground without technical knowledge what we are talking about almost seems like buck rogers and science fiction a blast of a single weapon up to 300 miles in the sky and by the way if it were in the daytime and you were looking away from it you would not even know it happened if you were looking at it obviously you would see it because it was very bright and it was line of sight you are not hurt by it it has no effect on our bodies but if you have an electronic watch that will stop if you get in your car that probably will not run the phones will not work there will be no power grid there are literally tens of thousands of what are called scada which are little control devices in our power grid and they all contain chips microelectronics and many of them were manufactured by organizations that do not even exist now because they have been in the field for a long time and all of those are gone signals traveling through fiber will get there but if you have anything other than optical switching if you have electronic switching the switches will be gone and so even if you are using fiber you still cannot transmit your data if you are using otherthanoptical switching so this chart demonstrates very clearly that our enemies know about emp because this is from a russian publication and it shows the effects of emp this is the power grid they show the transformers going out by the way if our big transformers go out there are no replacements on the shelf the biggest ones are not even manufactured in this country we will need to go to europe or scandinavia and you place your order and in a year to 18 months they will have the transformer for you i was concerned about emp and i called a friend of mine tom clancy who i knew had an emp scenario in one of his books and he lives on the eastern shore of maryland i knew him so i called tom and asked him for some information on emp he said if you have read my book you know as much about emp as i know but let me refer you to in his opinion the smartest man hired by the unitedstates government and he gave me the name of a dr lowell wood who worked for lawrence livermore lab one of our big nuclear labs out in california well this was back oh probably 12 13 years ago a while ago and cell phones were not all that popular you may remember that we were using pagers if you wanted to communicate with someone why you paged them and that went up to a satellite and back down to their pager and they got the little message please call so and so i did that with lowell wood i thought he was in california and he happened to be in washington andof course the same satellite that would have brought the signal down to california brought it down to washington within an hour he was sitting with me in my office dr lowell wood was indeed afont of knowledge on electromagnetic pulse i was concerned that because of cost considerations that our military was waiving emp hardening on essentially all of its new weapons systems and that that made us vulnerable to an emp attack and so i got in legislation the establishment of an emp commission and the emp commission was set up and functioned for 2 years normally our commissions work for a year but because of the details of this legislation they were able to work for 2 years they brought forth a big report this is the executive summary of that report and this was issued in 2004 this is the executive summary of the report of the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse emp attack and here are a number of powerpoint presentations that they prepared because they were going around the country briefing a large number of organizations federal and state and private on the results of their study the next chart shows the commissioners here you will see dr johnnie foster is the developer of almost all of our new atomic weapons dr bill graham who was the chair of this was rumsfelds cochair when they did that very important study on the emerging ballistic missile threat that came out a few years ago it is interesting i spent a couple of days in moscow with bill graham and rumsfeld when we were briefing members of the russian duma so that they would understand that our withdrawal from this treaty that prohibited us from protecting ourselves against intercontinental ballistic missiles had nothing to do with russia because we cannot imagine that we could produce a robust enough protection system to protect us against the literally thousands of intercontinental ballistic missiles that russia has but there are some new players on the scene out there like china and north korea and iran and who knows who may get in line and we could we felt with the development of a system the successful test just a few days ago be able to take out a few weapons from a country like this another very important member of this commission was dr joan woodward who is the deputy director of the sandia labs out in albuquerque new mexico i was out visiting my son there who works at the labs and he brought me home some material from the lab that led me to believe that they might have some knowledge that would be helpful in this emp study so i asked for a briefing i had not looked at the list and remembered specifically who was on this list of commissioners and i came in for a 5hour classified briefing on the commissions work and dr joan woodward had at her disposal all of the resources of the sandia labs so they did a really magnificent job of studying the threat not just to our military but to our national infrastructure the next chart shows something which alarmed them this is from their commission report we have redacted here the names of the russian generals but they interviewed two russian generals who told them that russia had designed and built a super emp nuclear weapon capable of generating 200 kilovolts per meter that is an enormously high pulse russian chinese and pakistani scientists are working in north korea now i am not saying this i am taking this from the report of the emp commission russian chinese and pakistani scientists are working in north korea and could enable that country to develop an emp weapon in the near future now this is the assessment of the emp commission the next chart just builds on the point that i made that most of our citizens may not know anything about emp because it is really a buck rogers star wars kind of a phenomena it almost seems like science fiction the fact is that although few of our people know about emp all of our potential enemies know about emp and i just wanted to make that very clear because i do not want anybody to have the notion that we are somehow informing a potential enemy of something that he does not know about this first quote here is a very interesting one this is not exactly the quote as i remember but it is a pretty h6354 co good paraphrase because i was there it was may 2nd of 1999 and i was sitting in a hotel in vienna austria with ten other members of our congress and three members of the russian duma i can tell you exactly when we were there we were there when the three prisoners hostages whatever you want to call them were released by yugoslavia you may remember that event they were released to jesse jackson as you may remember for 2 days we sat in that hotel room hammering out a framework for an agreement five days later that was voted by the g8 russia joined the g7 because the only country that the bosnians had enough respect for to be controlled by them was russia and when the g7 joined with russia they used the framework agreement that we had developed and that ended the hostilities there as you may remember well one of the three russians there was vladimir lukin he was the ambassador here at the end of bush 1 the beginning of the clinton administration at the time we were there he was the chair of their equivalent of our international relations committee in the russian duma he is a fairly short fellow with even shorter arms and he was extremely angry and he sat there for 2 days with his arms folded across his chest looking at the ceiling and then he made this statement and what he said was as i remember it if we really wanted to hurt you with no threat of retaliation we would launch an slbm and we would detonate a nuclear weapon high above your country and shut down your power grid and your communications for 6 months or so that was vladimir lukin another russian who was there who was i think the third ranking communist and yes there is still a big communist party in russia who was the third ranking communist alexander shurbanov and he smiled and he said if one weapon would not do it we have some spares like i think at least 7 000 spares you see the reason for no fear of retaliation was that if it was launched from the ocean we would never know where it came from well that was his comment now all of this is from the emp commission none of those are my statements chinese military writings describe emp as the key to victory and describe scenarios where emp is used against unitedstates aircraft carriers in a conflict over taiwan again a survey of worldwide military and scientific literature sponsored by the commission found widespread knowledge about emp and its potential military utility including in taiwan israel egypt india pakistan iran and north korea this next bullet is kind of repeated in the next chart so i will skip to this one iran has tested launching a scud missile from a surface vessel a launch mode that could support a national or"]]}
