cite an example of why that could be a problem let us say that a health plan sets up its definition for getting psychiatric care saying that somebody has to try to commit suicide three times before

these items first extending permanent normal trade relations with china is a win for fairness this agreement forces china to adhere to our rulesbased trading system without an agreement there are no rules and we have no say whatsoever in how china conducts its business with the rest of the world secondly it is a win for unitedstates workers and businesses china is an incredibly important emerging market with more than a billion consumers thirdly trade with china is a win for american values inside china through free and fair trade america will not only export many products and services but we will deliver a good oldfashioned dose of our democratic values and free market ideas fourthly international trade whether it be with china or any other nation means jobs for my state of new jersey and

that are already there in the last 6 years the manner in which this administration has circumvented congress when it comes to deployment of the unitedstates military forces around the world has been

recognize what the jacksonvanik waiver does and what it does not do by law the underlying issue here is about immigration based on vietnams record of progress on immigration and its continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver will continue to promote freedom of immigration disapproval would undoubtedly result in the opposite the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations 5 years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationships this is in americas own shortterm and longterm national interests it builds on vietnams own policy of political and economic reintegration into the world this will be a lengthy and challenging process however now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam vietnam continues to cooperate fully with our priority efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting of american powmias the jacksonvanik waiver supports this process the jacksonvanik waiver certainly does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion on may 4 however this body passed a resolution condemning just such violations of human rights the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate and sign a new bilateral commercial trades agreement with vietnam congress will have an opportunity in the future whether to approve it or not and whether to grant ntr or not but that is a separate process the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver only keeps this process going nothing more renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not antomatically make american exports to vietnam eligible for possible coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs the waiver only allows american exports to vietnam to be eligible for such coverage the war with vietnam is over and we have embarked upon a new although cautious expanded relationship with vietnam now is not the time to reverse this constructive course accordingly this member urges a no vote on the resolution having summarized the key reasons to oppose the resolution this member would like to expand on a few of these points first the issue of emigration which indeed is what the jacksonvanik provision is all about since march of 1998 the united states has granted vietnam a waiver of the jacksonvanik emigration provisions of the trade act of 1974 as this is only an annual waiver the president decided on june 2 2000 the renew this extension because he determined that doing so would substantially promote greater freedom of emigration from that country in the future this determination was based on vietnams record of progress on emigration and on vietnams continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year as a result we are approaching the completion of many refugee admissions categories under the orderiy departure program odp including the resettlement opportunity for vietnamese returnees former reeducation camp detainees mccain amendment subprograms and montagnards the vietnamese government has also agreed to help implement our decision to resume the odp program for former unitedstates government employees which was suspended in 1996 the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver is an acknowledgment of that progress disapproval of the waiver would undoubtedly result in vietnams immediate cessation of cooperation second the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations five years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationship this policy is in americas own short and longterm national interest it builds on vietnams o n policy of political and economic reintegration into the world in the judgment of this member this will be a lengthy and challenging process however he suggests that now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam third over the past five years vietnam has increasingly cooperated on a wide range of issues the most important of these is the progress and cooperation in obtaining the fullest possible accounting of americans missing from the vietnam war those members who attended the briefing by the distinguished ambassador to vietnam a former prisoner of war and former member of this body the honorable pete peterson learned of the significant efforts to which vietnam is now extending to address our concerns regarding the pow mia issue including their participation in remains recovery efforts which are physically very dangerous fourth the jacksonvanik waiver does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion however our experience has been that isolation and disengagement does not promote progress on human rights new sanctions including the symbolic disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver only strengthens the position of the communist hardliners at the expense of those in vietnams leadership who are inclined to support more openness engagement with vietnam has resulted in some improvements in vietnams human rights practices though we still remain disappointed at the very limited pace and scope of such reforms as this member mentioned on may 4 2000 this body adopted a resolution condemning vietnams human rights record given the strong reaction to our resolution by hanoi it is evident that our actions and concems did not go unnoticed fifth the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with any new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status however with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate a new bilateral commercial trade agreement with vietnam this agreement was signed two weeks ago in washington in the opinion of this member this agreement is in our own short and long term national interest vietnam remains a very difficult place for american firms to do business vietnam needs to undertake additional fundamental economic reforms this new bilateral trade agreement will require vietnam to make these reforms and will result in increased american exports supporting jobs here at home in a separate process with a separate vote congress will have to decide whether to approve or reject this new trade agreement and to grant ntr status to vietnam given that the agreement has yet to even be transmitted to congress and there are only a limited number of legislative days before the bodys scheduled adjoumment this member believes that these decisions will not be made until the 107th congress meets next year thus the jacksonvanik waiver simply ensures that the modest trade opportunities currently available to american businesses will continue until congress considers the agreement sixth contrary to the claims of some opponents of the jacksonvanik waiver renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not automatically make american investment in and exports to vietnam eligible for coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs such as those administered by the overseas private investment corporation the exportimport bank and the unitedstates department of agriculture the waiver only allows american exports and investments to be eligible for such coverage each must still face separate individual reviews against each programs relevant criteria americans must conclusively recognize that the war with vietnam is over with the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1995 the united states and vietnam embarked on a new relationship for the future it will not be an easy or quick process vietnam today remains a communist country with very limited freedoms for its citizens significant reforms must occur before relations can be truly normal the emotional scars of the vietnam war remain with many americans in the mid1960s this member was an infantry officer and intelligence officer with the first infantry division within a month of completing my service members of my tightknit detachment of that division were in vietnam and taking casualties the first night after arrival like other vietnamera veterans this member has emotional baggage a great many americans have emotional baggage about vietnam but this member would suggest that it is time to get on with our bilateral relationship and not reverse course on vietnam passing this resolution of disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver would represent yet another reflection of animosities of the past at a time when vietnam is finally looking ahead and making changes towards its integration into the international community a retrenchment on our part by this disapproval resolution is not in americas short and long term national interests

responders every bit as much as it needed a national defense our thanks certainly should go out not only to these firefighters but their loved ones who experienced the tremendous effort the sacrifice

about the dream team about how everybody is going to be caught in this wonderful net and all of your needs your prescription needs your medical needs will all be met by this democratic congress and by this democratic gore plan have you ever heard of the proposition you dont get nothing for free somewhere somebody has got to pay for it you better figure out what the problem is i think we can agree on the problem the democrats that were up here they would like you to believe that they are the only ones that under stand that there are prescription service problems out there in our society and that they are the ones with the solution and their solution is very simple it tracks the canadian health care plan it is nationalized health care it is socialized health care the republicans and frankly some conservative democrats are saying wait a minute wait a minute before we jump into this pool of nationalized medicine what you tried to do with hillary clinton about 6 or 7 years ago 7 or 8 years ago lets take a look at what the ramifications are lets study other nations that have jumped into the same pool that you want us to jump into for example canada and take a look at what the canadian system has that is better than our system that is what i propose you do before you jump into the pool take a look at what the unintended consequences are maybe there are some things in the canadian health care system that are better than the american health care system but i would tell you this that in america you still get the best health care of anywhere in the world when they like to come up here and talk about the uninsured americans remember that there are different categories you may have somebody that is uninsured but no matter where you are in america you can never be denied emergency care at a hospital if that hospital receives government funds and i do not know any hospital i am sure there are a couple of them out there but not very many more that do not operate on government funds the fact is the prescription drugs in this country the prices that are being charged for them are in my opinion outrageous there is no question that the angel here is not the

new jersey and his colleagues when they stand up here and trash and cut down more conservative democrats or the conservative republicans i think it is incumbent on them to kind of have an openness requirement tell the people what the consequences are of nationalized health care tell people what the consequences are of a canadiantype of system talk about it tell the people what the consequences are of research for better medicines know this is why this congress just does not jump up and sign the blank check offered by the gentleman fromnew jersey we are not going to jump up and sign a blank check at least enough of us on both sides of the aisle are saying wait a minute what are we doing what are the consequences clearly we all agree on the problem despite what the gentleman from new jersey says nobody is patting the pharmaceutical companies on the back and saying be proud of yourself they have not done a good job in some regards with medicine but frankly it appears that there is some gouging going on out there but before my colleagues addressthat problem take a very careful look at what the democrat the liberal democrat approach is because i can assure my colleagues in the long run first of all they promise it will only be 10 percent of the surplus and a much much smaller percent of the budget and nothing will grow and grow and grow and it is the open door for socialized medicine in this country for a national health care and there are a lot of people who in my opinion will suffer under a national health care plan nobody should be forgotten and nobody should be left behind but there are ways to address that without going into a hillary clintontype of health care plan so my discussion here tonight was not intended to be on health care but there is nobody else that stands here to rebut these gentlemen as they speak here unrebutted for 1 hour about the socalled quote cruel hoaxes by the republican leadership those words ought to be stricken from the record they are inaccurate they are misleading the gentleman from new jersey and some of his colleagues they know that the cruel hoax by the leadership i did not say there is a cruel hoax by the democratic leadership come on we have more protocol on this floor we can be more ladies and gentlemen in talking about the problem the people that suffer while this partisan bickering goes on back here are the senior citizens that do not have prescription care or by the way anybody that does not have the ability to care for themselves but do not address it by waving the magic wand and saying look citizens we have got something for nothing we are going to take care of all of your health care needs we are going to take away your personal responsibility and the government is going to assume it remember every time and i cannot say this strong enough every time the government assumes one of your responsibilities every time the government takes a burden of yours and makes it a burden of theirs they take something with it it comes with a price somewhere we are losing a freedom somewhere we are going to lose the ability to have choice in the future so in summary on this health care plan let me say i am discouraged by the comments that were made previous to my speaking here this evening we do not get anywhere and i direct my remarks at the liberal democrats look we are not going to get anywhere with a nationalized health care plan we are not going to get anywhere with socialized medicine why do you not sit down instead of talking about how leadership has this cruel conspiracy going on by throwing a few bucks at insurance companies why do you not put the electionyear rhetoric aside and sit down with us and help us try and figure out what a solution is every day that we use that kind of rhetoric there are people out there who are suffering because my colleagues are not willing to sit down and put their heads together to come up with a solution and there is a solution i am optimistic that we can have a solution we do have a great country and we have made wonderful strides in health care but clearly we have got some problems in that system but we can fix it without having our health care provided by the united states of america which means they are going to oversee what doctors you see they are going to oversee what kind of prescriptions you get they are going to oversee what kind of treatments you get they are going to oversee how often you are going to get to see this doctor or that doctor socialized or national medicine is not the magic answer it appears to be tonight it is very easy to buy into this very easy to buy into this because the democrats the liberal side over here not all democrats i stand corrected the liberal democrats over here they think you are going to get something for nothing and they are saying look it is easy for us to afford it no problem remember you do not get something for nothing let me switch subjects and talk about something much much more pertinent i think really because of the olympics i hope some of you have are having the opportunity to watch it in fact i was over at the office before i came over this evening watching the olympics how exciting that is even if it is taped nbc or whoever does that the reality of it is look what we get to see clear across the ocean in sydney and watch those olympics and i am very proud of those people i want to tell you i heard an advertisement i will not tell you the name of the company the other day but i heard an advertisement about the olympics and it said our young men and women that go over there to compete in the olympics they will come home heroes and i thought to myself you know they will come over celebrities i would like to have their autographs i am proud of them but i think using the word heroes is somewhat of a delusion i think the real word of heroes is used in a different type of setting there are sports celebrities and there are heroes i have a perfect example i am not just up here talking without giving you an example it is happening this week in pueblo colorado first of all on my way over i real quickly grabbed a dictionary and i looked up the word hero hero a mythological or a legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability an illustrious warrior a man admired for his noble qualities one that shows great courage an object of extreme admiration and devotion with courage with that said let me read an editorial from one of the leading newspapers in the state of colorado the pueblo chieftain it is called patriots week what is patriots week about this is a celebration of heroes this week we anticipate more than 110 americans more than 110 americans who have been decorated with the medal of honor which is the highest honor our country can give out 110 bf them will be in pueblo colorado to be honored by a city which was recently designated as one of the four finest communities to live in this country pueblo colorado picked out of hundreds of communities it was picked in the top four this week pueblo is hosting 110 medal of honor winners and they are calling their week patriots week i am going to go through my poster here in a few minutes with you and show you some of the interesting things about what this week is going to consist of first of all let me read the editorial out of the sunday chieftain star and journal my good friend bob rawlings who is the publisher and editor this is patriots week the home of heroes in pueblo colorado on tuesday the national medal of honor society convenes here for its annual convention pueblo is home to four medal of honor recipients the most of any city at least in modern times on thursday largerthanlife bronze sculptures of the four

black tie patriot dinner on friday will bring five greats from the world of sports to pueblo golfer arnold palmer gold glove baseball player brooks robinson nba center david the admiral robinson onetime boxing champion gene fullmer and the nhl hockey star pat lafontaine will receive the societys patriot award for the joy and support they have given to our military forces also commentator paul harvey and world war ii cartoonist bill maudlin will receive special awards from the medal of honor society two other veterans organizations are in pueblo this in week in conjunction with the societys convention two days ago the 50th anniversary reunion of the 578th combat engineering battalion began later this year the crew of the peachy a b29 piloted by puebloan bill haver that flew raids over japan will meet for its annual gettogether mr haver named the plane a replica of which is at the aircraft museum at the memorial airport in honor of his sister peachy wilcoxson and i know peachy today is constitution day all of these patriots spot for the ideals embodied in the united states constitution and many of their comrades perished in that effort so let each and every one of us reflect on that remarkable document and rededicate ourselves to the cause of liberty and justice well how exciting in pueblo alone for example i would like to just to kind of for a moment go over who are the four members who are from pueblo colorado as i mentioned in my comments unfortunately two of our members two of our citizens of pueblo passed away earlier this year mr crawford who was in the army you can see right here and mr sitter right here but we still have surviving drew dix the gentleman right here with the red dot and jerry murphy who was in the marines in korea this is the plaza that pueblo colorado has dedicated and put together through contributions from the local community here is a community that came together did not come to the united states congress and ask for money did not expect the government to do it they got together in their community of pueblo colorado to honor all medal of honor recipients but specifically to put something that will be a longlasting recognition of the four medal of honor winners from pueblo colorado that is what that little plaza is going to look like the statues here is one of jerry murphy 82 feet tall that is the completed statute there honoring jerry here so you have an idea there is bill crawford before he passed away as he stands with the statue of him which is also about 81 2 feet high this is going to be an exciting week in pueblo what i thought i would do is share with my colleagues four of the stories of these medal of honor winners i can tell you that i have had the occasion and i consider it amongst the highest privileges of my congressional career if i were to kind of recapture my memories of serving in the united states congress where i felt the most fortunate to meet somebody or the most privileged to be able to shake their hand i would have to put it in the order of i am catholic the pope and mother theresa and right behind them our medal of honor winners in fact i was in a parade in pueblo not very long ago and i had the opportunity in that parade to shake the hands of two medal of honor winners who were watching the parade you feel so much pride because these people are such heroes they really are what heros are the word they do not cause any delusion to the word hero h7715 they embody hero in its fullest envisions let me talk about drew dix i will point out drew here drew right here by the way a special hello to his mother a very sweet person in pueblo colorado let me talk a little about drew drew d dix unitedstates army special forces vietnam citation for conspicuous gallantry in the action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty sergeant dix distinguished himself by exceptional heroism by serving as a unit advisor to heavily armed vietcong battalions attacked the providence capital of chau phu resulting in complete breakdown and fragmentation of defenses of the city sergeant dix with a patrol of vietnamese soldiers was recalled to assist in the defense of the city learning that a nurse was trapped in a house near the center of the city sergeant dix organized a relief force successfully rescued the nurse and returned her safely to the tackle operations ceiter but that is not all being informed that now there were other trapped civilians within the city sergeant dix voluntarily led another force to rescue eight civilian employees located in a building which was under heavy mortar and small arms fire sergeant dix then returned to the center of the city upon approaching a building he was subjected to intense automatic rifle and machine gun fire from an unknown number of vietcong he personally assaulted the building killing six of the vietcong and rescuing two philippinos the following day sergeant dix still onhis own volition assembled a 20man force and though under intense enemy fire cleared the vietcong out of the hotel the theater and other adjacent buildings within the city during this portion of the attack army republic of vietnam soldiers inspired by the heroism and success of sergeant dix rallied and commenced firing upon the viet cong sergeant dix individually captured 20 prisoners including a high ranking viet cong official he then attacked enemy troops who had entered the residence of the deputy providence chief and was successful in rescuing the officials wife and children sergeant dixs personal heroic actions resulted in 14 confirmed viet cong killed in action and possibly 25 more the capture of 20 prisoners 15 weapons and the rescue of 14 united states and free world civilians the heroism of sergeant dix was in the highest tradition and reflects great credit upon the united states army raymond jerry murphy and if you ever go to pueblo colorado you will see murphy boulevard i mean these guys are real heroes their community loves them our country has deep respect for medal of honor winners excuse me not winners they did not win it medal of honor recipients and i stand corrected on that raymond jerry murphy united states marine corps korea citation for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as a platoon commander of company a an action against enemy aggressor forces although painfully wounded by fragments froman enemy mortar shell while leading his evacuation platoon in support of assault units attacking a cleverly concealed and wellentrenched hostile force occupying commanding ground second lieutenant murphy steadfastly refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small arms fire skillfully maneuvering his force from one position to the next and shouting words of encouragement undeterred by the increasing intense enemy fire he immediately located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire swept hill to direct evacuation teams to the wounded personally carrying many of the stricken marines to safety when reinforcements were needed by the assaulting elements second lieutenant murphy employed part of his unit as support and during the ensuing battle personally killed two of the enemy with his own pistol with all of the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units beginning to disengage he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of friendly forces of the hill and although suffering intense pain from his previous wounds he seized an automatic rifle to provide more firepower when the enemy reappeared from the trenches after reaching the base of the hill he organized a search party and again ascended the slope for a final check on missing marines locating and carrying the bodies of machine gun crew back down the hill wounded a second time while conducting the entire force to the line of departure through a continuing barrage of enemy small arms artillery and mortar fire he again refused medical assistance until assured that every one of his men including all of the casualties had preceded him to the main lines his resolute and inspiring leadership and exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon second lieutenant murphy and enhance the finest traditions of the united states marine corps william crawford our third pueblo citizen united states army world war ii for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of life and above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy in italy 13 september 1943 whencompany i attacked an enemyheld position on hill 424 the third platoon in which private crawford was a squad scout attacked as a base platoon for the company after reaching the crest of the hill the platoon was pinned down by intense enemy machine and small arms fire locating one of these guns which was dug in on a terrace on his immediate front private crawford without orders and on his own initiative moved over the hill under enemy fire to a point within a few yards of the machine gun emplacement and singlehandedly destroyed the machine gun and killed three of the crew with a hand grenade thus enabling his platoon to continue its advance when the platoon after reaching the crest was once more delayed by enemy fire private crawford again in face of intense fire and on his own volition advanced directly to the front midway between two hostile two this time hostile machine gun nests located on a higher terrace and placed in a small ravine moving first to the left with a hand grenade he destroyed one gun emplacement and killed the crew then he worked his way to the right and under continuous fire from the other machine gun emplacement he used one hand grenade and the use of his rifle and he killed one enemy and blew out the machine gun nest and forced the remainder of the enemy to flee seizing the enemy machine gun that was left from the one emplacement he fired on the withdrawing germans and facilitating his companys advance these are remarkable individuals carl sitter united states marine corps korea for conspicuous gallantry at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty as a commanding officer of company g in action against enemy aggressor forces ordered to break through enemy infested territory to reinforce his battalion the morning of 29 november captain sitter continuously exposed himself to enemy fire as he led his company forward and despite 25 percent casualties suffered in the furious action he succeeded in driving the group to its objective assuming the responsibility of attempting to seize and occupy a strategic area occupied by a hostile force of regiment strength deeply entrenched on a snow covered hill commanding the entire valley southeast of town as well as the line of march of friendly troops withdrawing to the south he reorganized his depleted units the following morning and boldly led them up that steep frozen hillside under blistering fire encouraging and redeploying his troops as casualties occurred and directing forward platoons as they continued the drive to the top of the ridge during the night when the vastly outnumbered enemy launched a sudden vicious counterattack setting the hill ablaze with mortar machinegun and automatic weapons fire and taking a heavy toll in troops captain sitter visited each foxhole and gun position coolly deploying and integrating reinforcing units consisting of service personnel unfamiliar with infantry tactics into a coordinated combat team and instilling in every man the will and determination to hold his position at all costs with the enemy penetrating his lines in repeated counterattacks which often required handtohand combat and on one occasion infiltrating to the command post with hand grenades he fought gallantly with his men in repulsing and killing the fanatic attackers in each encounter painfully wounded in the face wounded in the arms and wounded in the chest by bursting grenades he staunchly refused to be evacuated and he continued to fight on until a successful defense of the area was assured with a loss of the enemy by more than 50 percent of their troops dead or wounded or captured his valiant leadership superb tactics and great personal valor throughout 36 hours of bitter combat reflect the highest credit upon captain sitter and the unitedstates naval service these four gentlemen that i just described as heroes who got the medal of honor are from pueblo colorado but i want to remind all of my colleagues there is what we call the medal of honor society and 110 members of that society will be in pueblo colorado this week to be honored by our community and to be honored by our nation for what they have done those four stories i told are but a drop in the bucket of the stories of valor the stories of courageous brave men and women who stepped out above the call of duty because they believed in america they believed in freedom and they were willing to lay their life down for it this weekend i had a wonderful opportunity to spend with my wife and my parents in meeker colorado and we were up at the cemetery an old cemetery we were in the old section of the cemetery and i walked by a grave and it was a young man not much on the gravestone had the gentlemens name had his birth he was 22 years old and all it said on the gravestone was he died for his country as we know we have thousands and thousands and thousands of men and women in this country who have died for their country and we have hundreds of thousands of men and women who have fought bravely for what this country stands for for the freedom of this country for the benefit of all of us we cannot acknowledge everybody with a medal of honor so we know that there are brave and courageous individuals out there who should have received the medal of honor who earned the medal of honor but did not receive it but we do know we still have a group of individuals who did receive the medal of honor and they truly should own lock stock and barrel the title of hero"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today this week children from every state in the union have come to washington to participate in the juvenile diabetes foundation childrens congress as the cochairman of the house diabetes caucus which boasts 265 members of this body who have dedicated themselves to trying to find a cure for diabetes it is fitting that we pay tribute to these young people who came here today and participated in a ceremony on the west front of the capitol to highlight the need to cure diabetes this is not only an adult disease it is a childs disease a cruel childrens disease that affects millions of people in this country it is necessary it is appropriate that this congress devote adequate resources to try to find a cure for disease through research so i am happy to join all the other members of the caucus in saluting the juvenile diabetes foundation and all the children who participated here today i am especially proud of nancy stockton the delegate from cheney washington nancy is a tribute to her family her community and all young people with diabetes"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today i would like to speak on an issue which i have indeed spoken about before but i have some startling new information for the american people it is no surprise to anyone that i am deeply concerned about americas relationship with communist china in this body we have votes on the trading status with communist china and this administration is operating under policy guidelines that deal with communist china in a certain way in fact the united states congress the house of representatives and the senate have voted for normal trade relations or what used to be called mostfavorednation status for china and a majority of members of this body on my side of the aisle have voted to treat communist china in terms of our trade relations as we do normal trade relations with other societies that of course with a largenumber of people on the other side supporting mostfavorednation status normal trade relations as well the clinton administration has gone beyon l this perhaps those of us in this house believe that trading relations with another country even a dictatorship like that on the mainland of china will in some way help that society evolve into a more peaceful more benevolent more democratic situation i consider that to be wishful thinking i disagree with that concept i personally believe in free trade between free people and it is better to give dictatorships and people who live under dictatorships the incentive to reform and the incentive to move towards democracy rather than giving them the fruits of a positive trade relationship with this the strongest economy in the world i would treat communist china differently than i would treat the government of belgium or italy or other democratic societies in trying to determine what our trade policy should be again this is based on wishful thinking however it is beyond my realm and my ability to understand how this administration has been able to move forward with its policies toward communist china over these last 6 years the president of the united states has insisted time and again that communist china be considered a strategic partner of the united states those are the words that this administration has insisted upon communist china a strategic partner of the united states a few moments ago we pledged our allegiance to the flag of the united states of america our flag as i noted before we said the pledge stands for freedom and justice how can a country which is based not on some ethnic background as our country has no ethnicity that we are supposedly protecting as in other countries their national identity stems from that from an ethnic or racial homogeny among the people but we have no religious belief that binds all of our people together in fact we have every race and every ethnic group from every part of tha world people who have come here to america and we have every religion in america what binds americans together is our love of liberty and our love of justice and our love of freedom that is the foundation that is the basis of our country how can we if we believe that to be true consider the worlds worst human rights abuser as our strategic partner yes having a trading relationship with a dictatorship such as china is wishful thinking it is also exploitation on the part of various business interests in the united states business interests that i might add could care less about the working people in our country often closing up factories here in order to set up factories in china in order to sell the products that were made in china back here in the united states because we have such a low tariff on chinese goods although the chinese tariff on our goods is very high but if we stand for freedom and justice how can we have not just a trading relationship but a strategic partnership with communist china it is my contention that this nonsense this almost surrealistic policy on the part of the clinton administration has already yielded a horrible bounty of threats and jeopardy to the united states of america let me make this very clear the clinton policy of treating communist china as a friend as a benevolent country as a strategic partner has resulted in putting the united states in grave danger there are two things that i will talk about today first i have spoken about this before and it is well known in the public although it is being denied through the liberal media over and over and over again now and that is the weapons and technology of mass destruction that communist china has managed to obtain because of our lax policies towards the communist china regime and number two i would like to speak today about dramatic information that i have uncovered in panama during a recent trip to panama i spent time investigating the situation spoke to people who were in hiding who were afraid for their lives spoke to others who were firsthand observers of corruption and firsthand observers of a strategic maneuver on the part of the chinese that is moving forward and putting the united states in great danger so i will be speaking first about the technology and missiles that have found their way and been upgraded the chinese missiles that have been upgraded with american technology and then i would like to talk a little bit about what i discovered in panama it is most disturbing to me that after 2 years we still have press reports from the likes of bob scheerer of the los angeles times and why the los angeles times feels that it has to always tout the far left line i do not know i do not understand that i do not understand how a major newspaper in the united states can continually take the side of those leftwing regimes and downplay any threat to the united states that these leftwing regimes around the world pose to the united states of america but now mr scheerer in the l a times and others in the media and this administration through an orchestrated maneuvering is trying to suggest that there was no validity to the cox report and that the chinese really have not through underhanded means obtained information that permits them to develop weapons of mass destruction that threaten millions of americans this i assert today is a truism over the last 7 years the communist chinese have been able to obtain and start putting into their weapons systems technology that cost the american people the american taxpayer billions of dollars to develop the communist chinese have been able to use american technology to leapfrog ahead by decades farther ahead than what they would be if it was not for the fact that they had american technology at their disposal which permits them to build weapons of mass destruction that threaten every american city that threaten tens of millions of americans with nuclear incineration they have atomic weapons that are based on american technology and they obtained them from the united states in some way i would say today that the american people need to pay attention i would alert the american people that something is wrong with the taxpayer dollars that they have spent by the billions which are now being put in the hands of people like those who are in charge of the regime in beijing the communist chinese regime thbere is something wrong when those billions of dollars that we spent during the cold war now find their way the technology that was developed finds its way to a power like communist china and no amount of words it is hard to even describe the process of the mangling of the language and word games that is being played by this administration in order to call china our strategic partner to call communist china the worlds worst human rights abuser our strategic partner 0i 1015 this has resulted in several things number one this body had to act on its h8378own to force the clinton administration to discontinue military exchange programs with the communist chinese regime let us make this very clear communist china is the worlds worst human rights abuser it is a communist dictatorship their leadership still claims to their own communist congresses in beijing that the united states is the enemy and that they will destroy us but yet we have had a policy in the last 5 years of military exchanges in which we are teaching them our military secrets and we permit their top military brass to observe our troops and how they act and the game plans that we use during our warfare our potential warfare with any adversary at the same time we have been taking these military exchange programs and what have we been doing we have been teaching the communist chinese how to run a logistics system how to supply troops in the field how to transport troops this we are doing with the military of the worlds worst human rights abuser a country that threatens our own national security what sense does that make the people of tibet are still suffering under a genocidal policy by the communist re gime in beijing there are muslims in the far reaches of western china who are also suffering a genocidal attack believers in god christians who refuse to register with the government are being brutally suppressed thrown into concentration camps they call it the laogai system of prisons now we hear that a buddhist sect made up of middleaged and senior citizens of china who practice nothing more than kind of a breathing exercise an exercise program in the morning that helps the soul as well as the body even this little buddhist religious sect is now coming under severe repression this is not a normal regime this is not like belgium or the netherlands or even mexico which is struggling to try to have free elections there are no free elections there are no parties there is no freedom in china but yet we are training the military in china on how to be more effective and what will that military do it will either be used to repress their own people and participate in destroying the culture and the people of tibet or these other repressed minorities in china or it will be used in aggression against their neighbors already burma has become nothing more than a fiefdom for china we see in the spratly islands the communist chinese trying to bully their neighbors and grab these islands so that they can control the malacca straits where so much of the worlds commerce goes through that one little strait there in south asia they may use that military training that we are providing them in that type of activity or they may use the military training that we are providing them to kill americans this is insanity it is an insane policy to call this type of regime our strategic partner and it is threatening the lives and the wellbeing of millions of americans every time we turn around we are finding out that our country is more in jeopardy because of conscious decisions on the part of the clinton administration to treat communist china as a benevolent power this is not only insanity this is a crime against the american people especially against the youth of our country the american people who are trying to raise their family sacrificed america sacrificed during the cold war america sacrificed in order to make a more peaceful world and to protect the cause of human freedom and yet now with the cold war over we are finding that our young people our children are going to be in as great a danger 10 years from now as they were at the height of the cold war why is that because we have a policy that makes no sense that is contrary to our interests in dealing with a regime on the mainland of china that hates everything that the united states stands for let me make this clear about the regime that controls the mainland of china these are gangsters these are people who hate the united states of america because they believe that we are the only power that standsin their way of their destiny just as japan during the 1920s believed that it was the destiny of japan to control all of asia and into the pacific basin the japanese knew that the united states was the only power that stood in their way that we were the only ones that could stop them from their destiny these militaristic gangsters who ran japan at the time that same attitude now is what we find in beijing when we let their scientists go to our laboratories when we train their military they do not say oh the united states of america must be our friends otherwise they would not be so open they are not saying that they are saying the united states of america is weak they are saying that the people of the united states of america are permitting weapons technology to come into our possession and we hate them that must mean the americans are cowards that is what is going on we are laying the foundation for a bitter future for our young people because 10 years from now when the communist chinese have taken the technology that they have stolen from us and obtained through our openness with them they will be put into weapons systems that will threaten the lives of our young people when they reach adulthood and sometime and someday in the future we will send an aircraft carrier into the pacific and thousands of american lives will be lost if we get into a confrontation because the chinese will have the technology to sink our aircraft carriers and murder our military personnel and when we look back we will find that that technology was developed by the american taxpayers during the cold war and offered on a plate to the communist chinese this is a sinful policy it is sinful because it ignores the fundamental values of our country and it is sinful because we the government and we are the government the united states of america we the people we are supposed to be watching out for the peoples interest especially the interest of future generations of americans this acknowledgment of the type of technological disaster that we are in right now started 2 years ago as chairman of the subcommittee on space and aeronautics which is my primary responsibility here in the house of representatives i went to a meeting of aerospace workers to find out what projects they are working on and to get a firsthand look and feel for our aerospace industry in the united states during that meeting one of the employees of the aerospace industry that i was talking to was talking about the project that he had just been involved in he had just come back from china he was saying congressman those chinese rockets they do not even work they do not have rightstage separation technology we are trying to put our satellites up with those rockets and they will not work and they can only carry one payload they can only carry one satellite so i have spent the last year over there helping them try and correct these problems i could not believe what i was hearing finally when he was done i said let me get this straight your company has used this technology that we paid for that the taxpayers paid for you are using that technology and your expertise and your company every means that your company has to improve the capability and the reliability of the rocket systems over in china he says why yes their stage separation he repeated that they do not have the exploding bolts the stage separation that they need and they blow up right after it takes off i looked at that aerospace worker and i said you know i think it is a good thing when communist chinese rockets blow up and all of a sudden he said oh you are thinking about th6 national security implications and i said yes yes i am i am thinking about that it is something we should think about he said do not worry we have a waiver from the white house well that made me feel real good about that i spent the next 6 months researching this issue i went to the major aerospace firms and talked to them i went to the subcontractors i went to the aerospace employees and i researched this issue myself before i made a speech on the floor of the house of representatives what i found was a verification that our companies some of our major corporations were over in china providing them with the technology they needed to make sure their rockets did not explode when the stages separated to make sure that the rockets in china could carry more than one payload when we are talking about payloads we are not just talking about a peaceful satellite here if you can carry more than one satellite you can carry more than one warhead more than one warhead means if they send a missile to the united states that does not explode because the stage separation now works with american technology that it can carry two atomic bombs or three or four and wipe out tens of millions of people in the united states rather than just a million people this was not a secret to this administration that this was going on in fact when alarm bells went off this administration put their thumb right on top of those civil servants throughout the administration who were supposed to be watching put for our security we found that especially to be true in how this administration has been running our national laboratories for those who do not understand we have laboratories where we have developed these weapons of mass destruction that can either be used to protect freedom and preserve the peace or if that technology gets into the hands of monsters like hitler or the militaristic japanese or the communist chinese regime in beijing those weapons would threaten humankind because china has to be told that they are our strategic partner we had a policy of letting these scientists from the peoples republic of china do their experiments in our laboratories in our weapons laboratories over and over again we have found during this investigation we have found that those people who sounded the alarm career civil servants civil service people were repressed by this administration were told to shut up or get out we have had hearings on this and documented this over and over again now what has this resulted in what are we talking about here we are talking about missile technology and we are talking about technology that has permitted them to build weapons that can kill millions of americans probably the size of that little desk down there that little table right there put into a chinese rocket that can kill millions of americans or millions of tibetans or millions of japanese or millions of south koreans that technology has been taken obtained from the united states from our scientists and now is in the hands of a regime that is in the middle of committing genocide in tibet repressing their own people and involved in a great military expansion a country that is being provided by our own policies with 50 to 60 billion of hard currency surplus because we are permitting them the trade status of a benevolent friendly country we will pay dearly for this nonsense our young people will face a threat that they should not have to face because of this indefensible totally indefensible policy but it is worse after my investigation into the original charges about the use of technology to upgrade and to perfect communist chinese rockets the gentleman from california mr cox and the gentleman from washington mr dicks were made the heads of a select committee and they conducted their own investigation with people with much more expertise than i have specialists went in and confirmed this horrible horrible transfer of technology to the communist chinese aid now the clinton administration and the news media is trying to get the american people to relax forget about it pretend it does not exist in fact robert scheerer of the l a times is trying to claim it never happened yes the communist chinese just simply found the plans for the w88 warhead atomic warhead they found those plans under their pillow one night because the tooth fairy must have left it there i am sure that is what must have happened it was either the tooth fairy or it was a policy by this administration that ended up with a transfer of that technology the american people can decide which one of those scenarios actually happened by the way this is not the first time such things have happened there have been transfers of technology in the past there are reports that in the 1930s howard hughes designed a fighter aircraft that was a superior fighter aircraft for its day and that our government did not follow through on his offer to produce these fighter aircraft the story is that the japanese got a hold of the blueprints for that and howard hughes was the one who actually designed the japanese zero which resulted in the death of so many americans during world war ii i do not know if that is true i have heard that report over and over again it may not be true but we do know that hughes electronics certainly is one of the companies that has been involved in transferring rocket technology to the communist chinese in order to perfect their rocket systems also some people do not know that during the postwar period after world war h the english decided to prove to josef stalin that they were his friends and so the english shipped to joe stalin this bloody dictator in russia they shipped to him a complete rolls royce jet engine which at that time was the utmost that was the ultimate in all weapons technology a jet engine for an airplane know what that did not make josef stalin any more benevolent it did not make josef stalin more inclined to trust the west and become more democratic and open no josef stalin used that jet engine that rolls royce jet engine not to build passenger planes that could help tie russia with the rest of the world josef stalin used that rolls royce engine which was copied every little bit of it and mass produced in russia he used it in the mig fighters that shot down american planes in korea josef stalin launched a war in korea and used the technology that the english had given him to produce airplanes that we could not shoot down and thousands of american lives were lost because of it the british just thought that they were trying to do something that would prove that they were friendly when will the free people of the world understand that when dealing with a gangster or a bully or a dictator we must do so from strength or that dictator will perceive a weakness the communist chinese regime is no more benevolent no more peaceful today in fact there are signs that it has become worse in these last 10 years with all due respect to my colleagues in this body that vote for most favored nation status over and over again i think the communist chinese would have to bomb the capitol of the united states before they would quit voting to provide this very lucrative trade status to the communist chinese regime and the chinese continue as i say their aggressive action about 6 months ago i flew over the spratly islands it took me 2 years to get to the spratly islands because our state department did not want me to see what was going on there what was going on there the chinese communists are taking the islands these islands are just about 100 miles off the philippines yet they are 800 miles off the coast of china and the chinese communists are building fortifications when i finally got out to the spratly islands i was in an old c130 an old propellerdriven airplane that the philippine air force provided me and as soon as we got through the clouds there were three chinese war ships right there in the lagoon of which is one of the spratly islands not only were there three chinese war ships but the chinese construction workers were feverishly trying to complete a fortification on those islands we could see their welding torches even as our plane dipped down to take a low pass over those islands we could see the torches at work and they were building their fortifications this is very similar very similar to the situation in the 1920s and 1930s when the japanese fortified the pacific islands and in this case the chinese are trying to grab these islands from the philippines a democratic country with very little military trying to grab these islands in order to what in order to bracket the water passages between the mainland of china and the spratly islands which will then give them a strangle hold on 50 percent of the commerce of asia a strangle hold and also a grip on americas ability to defend asia something else is going on right now and this is where i would like to lead in to my talk on panama the communist chinese regime is also involved in a strategic maneuver here is our strategic partner involved in a strategic maneuver one would think if they were our strategic partner that maneuver would be something that we would like because they are our partners are they not no they are involved in a strategic maneuver to strangle the united states of america and it is very clear that they have targeted areas in which the united states is most vulnerable the panama canal happens to be one of those areas let me make clear panama is where the two major oceans of the world come together the pacific and the atlantic oceans it is where the two great continents of the western hemisphere come together the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere this is one of the choke points of the world this and the suez canal and the straits of gibralter this and the molucca straits near the spratly islands what do we find what do we find we find that the united states of america has removed all of its military personnel from panama i was down as i say in panama a very short time ago a month ago and i was shocked to see ghost towns in what had been only a short time ago american military bases panama of course has no military of their own they have no military and they have always relied on the united states military to protect the canal against any type of aggression so when i traveled to panama and having been there many times in the past and seen many american military persons there to protect panama and protect our national security interests and protect the canal i was shocked when i saw they were gone they are all gone it is like this hall of congress now i am the only member standing here when one goes down to panama where there used to be tens of thousands of american troops navy air force marines army they were always there they are gone and there is no panamanian military force to take up the slack now what does that mean to us well that means to us that there is a vulnerability there there are two vulnerabilities number one there is a war going on next door in colombia and already the narco terrorists who are allied with fidel castro and the people who hate the united states already those guerrillas have infiltrated into the panamanian military there is nothing standing between them and the panama canal that alone should cause alarm bells to go off because the panama canal is vulnerable to sabotage i will not go into detail but it is incredibly vulnerable to sabotage what concerns me more is the overwhelming evidence of a chinese presence and even domination of panama in the panama canal something that is in the process of happening that to me was even more frightening because i know that we can blink our eyes and this magnificent achievement of the united states a canal between the two oceans something that we rely on in times of international emergency so we can send our ships from one ocean to the other and take off days actually a week of travel around the horn in south america that that panama canal now is totally vulnerable and is slowly coming under the domination of the communist chinese now let me say what i mean there is a company called hutchison whampoa run by a man named li kashing he is part of the clique he is part of beijings inner circle he is a front man and his company is a front for the chinese government the chinese government in fact owns over 30 percent outright of his company this company is tied not closely but tied totally within the small circle of elite of the beijing regime this company now has won the contract which provides them control of all of the port facilities on both ends of the canal now to be fair about it there are some other new port facilities further away that are being built but on both ends of the canal directly outside of the canal those port facilities are now under control of this communist chinese front cdmpany now how did that happen and what does that mean when i went to panama the first thing i did was try to go down to those areas that are now under lease arrangement by the way it is not a 10year lease not a 25year lease the lease is giving them up to 50 years of control of these strategic positions on both sides of the canal by the way the lease agreement also gives them concessions on certain ways of how the panama canal will be run the piloting of the ships et cetera they are also in negotiations and are trying to and i am not sure if this is part of the lease or not to get control of one of the air bases in panama the howard air base as well as some of the other military facilities that we left behind now how did that happen what has gone wrong here what is happening how can a country that is considered to be belligerent and many people are trying to have a realistic policy considered to be belligerent and hostile to the united states end up with a commanding position in the panama canal and a position to dominate this strategic waterway how did that happen where was our intelligence where was the nsa who were they listening to where was the cia i think the cia and the nsa probably did their job the trouble is that they are reporting to the clinton administration and everywhere in the world where we look where americas national security has been put in jeopardy by the communist chinese the fingerprints of the clinton administration are all over the crime scene the people who are supposed to be protecting our interests are not protecting our national security interests so i went down and i met with the ambassador the ambassador to panama from the united states i asked the ambassador i said mr ambassador how did they get this contract i said in fact i have even heard that there might have been some bribery involved here he says oh we do not know if there is any corruption involved in this i said what do your intelligence reports say he said what intelligence reports i said what does the nsa say when they are listening in on the conversations involved with the people involved in these negotiations well i do not know i have not seen those reports if there are any what does your station chief the head of the cia there what does he say i have not seen any report by him this is the most important thing that has happened in the past 10 years in panama and the ambassador has not bothered to read the intelligence reports of how that contract came into being so i said well mr ambassador this is really an important thing do you not think you ought to check up on it and he says oh i guess maybe i should well come to find out that there are certain people who work for the government whose job is not to see any evil not to go looking for those reports our ambassador to panama happens to have been who it happens to have been the man who was the chairman of president clintons reelection campaign in florida the last time around i am not saying that he has done anything corrupt or wrong i am just saying that he has not looked at these intelligence reports and he is a political appointee who is highly politically involved with the presidents personal political ambitions somebody is not watching out for the national security interests of the united states so i went out after meeting the ambassador by the way the cia station chief was conveniently not available when i was in panama conveniently not available so i went out to try to find things on my own i am sorry to reporttoday to my colleagues and to whoever is listening or reading the that i was able to find out information that has indicated to me that the lease arrangement the contract arrangement with this communist chinese front company was obtained through bribery of highlevel panamanian officials i talked to people who were directly involved with the negotiations directly involved with the bidding process and i was told and these people are afraid to say so publicly but they told me privately that there were bribes in the millions of dollars that were paid to the former president of panama balladares for the lease agreement with the hutchison whampoa company and it was again repeated to me over and over again that hutchison whampoa did not offer the best bid for those port facilities on either side of the panama canal yet they were awarded that lease agreement and the only explanation is that millions of dollars of bribes were provided to highlevel panamanian officials president balladares who was president at the time and recently stepped down it is important for us to note that the panamanian constitution prevents a president of panama from running for reelection president balladares wanted to change the constitution so that he could run for reelection the chinese certainly bankrolled that campaign and guess who was down there running the referendum to try to change the panamanian constitution so this man who helped give away the panama canal would have the right to run again for office who was down there running that campaign for him james carville that is who who is he every time you turn around the presidents inner circle is involved with something that is undercutting americas national security i am recommending to our colleagues that we pay attention to panama up until now the reason these things are happening is that we have left it to the administration and panama has been off of the radar screen of the united states of america it cannot be if we let foreign policy be the purview only of the government and only of the executive branch our country will suffer as it has been put in great jeopardy by our relations with communist china just one other note when i went to panama the head of the panamanian cia that is their central intelligence agency was in hiding her name was samantha smith samantha smith was in hiding and our embassy did not know where she was they did not know what was happening how to get hold of her there was no report on samantha smith of how we could talk to her the head of the panamanian cia was in hiding for this reason because there had been information that she had been involved in a smuggling ring of communist chinese aliens chinese residents of the mainland of china who had paid 30 000 a head to president balladares of panama in order to go through panama into the united states of america hundreds of them this woman the head of the cia was the one who signed off on this operation but she had signed off on it because her president had ordered her to sign those documents those requests from these chinese coming from the mainland first of all i want to know who these people were who these chinese were who could afford to pay 30 000 to be smuggled into the united states through panama chinese farmers do not have that kind of money i do not know if they are saboteurs i do not know who they are but i want to know who they are the head of the panamanian cia when she realized she was going to be the fall person she was going to be blamed when this became known went into hiding guess what our our embassy just could not find her they had not had contact with her but guess what within one day i found her within one day i had a meeting with this head of their panamanian intelligence she just told me everything about how the president had forced her to sign these documents ordered her even above her objection and how these chinese would come in these illegal chinese would come in land in panama and there would be a special escort officer that would take them on the second floor at the airport in panama and take them around and then take them where she did not know and how she had protested to the president but the president of panama balladares had ordered her to do so this is the man who also fascinatingly enough provided the contract for hutchison whampoa the chinese front company that now controls both ends of the canal let me tell the members something that i consider to be even another little bit of evidence that we should not miss supposedly our government has been negotiating with the panamanian government the government of balladares for what we have been negotiating to try to maintain some type of military presence in panama to protect the panama canal polls indicate now that from 70 to 80 percent of the panamanian people love the united states and want to see a military presence of the united states in panama we left they told us to leave and we left now they know we have been serious all these years that we believe they have the right and freedom to control their own country we are not like russia china if the people do not want us we do not stay there and brutalize the people in order to maintain our military bases we got out that just reconfirmed for the people of panama hey the americans are good people after all they really do believe in democracy we want them back although the polls showed 70 to 80 percent of the panamanian people wanted us there our state department could not negotiate a contract and a deal that would permit us an agreement that would permit us to have an american military presence in panama they could not do it something is wrong something is wrong here of course it was president balladares who was the head of that country and of course our own ambassador had not read any of the intelligence reports i do not guess he has read any intelligence reports on any instructions balladares might have had with those negotiators or any contact that he might have with the communist chinese all i know is we are depending on an administration to defend our country to make sure our children are not put in jeopardy and that administration is treating the communist chinese as a strategic partner and we are being put in danger we have to reverse this situation it is up to the congress of the united states to act and it is up to the american people to demand action and to get involved in this process if we want our children to be safe we cannot do so by giving the communist chinese leverage on future generations of americans we will not be safe if the communist chinese have weapons based on american technology that could murder tens of millions of our people that is not the kind of world we want to leave our children in 10 years that is the kind of world they are going to have unless we act the first step we have to quit treating communist china as a friend and be realistic i am not saying we should go to war with them we should not but we must be tough and we must be strong and we must demand a trade relationship that is mutually beneficial and certainly not one that gives them 70 billion in hard currency and puts the american people out of work i am introducing legislation today and i have approximately 25 cosponsors at this time i am introducing legislation now i ask people to call their congressman to join the resolution the panama resolution offered by the gentleman from california mr roarabacher that is me i am asking them to call their members of congress and ask them to join me in a resolution that does three things in panama number one it asks the new government that defeated the balladares regime president moscoso who is a woman a wonderful person and a ray of hope for the united states government that we do our best and we call on president moscoso to cancel this lease with this chinese front company cancel it and to investigate how that lease came about that is what we are asking the president of panama to do in this resolution we are asking also that the united states move forward with an investigation as well as with the government of panama into these charges of corruption on how that lease was issued in the first place when they cancel this lease we are asking that they institute a new system that is open and fair and transparent as they say so there will be honest bidding for those port facilities in the panama canal also we should investigate how that last contract happened number three we should negotiate with this new government in panama president moscoso some type of arrangement where we can work together with panama for the security of panama and also the security of the panama canal these are things that we need to do it is part of my resolution as a sense of congress we are calling for those things i would hope that all of my colleagues come back here next week and that we get a number of cosponsors on this and that this moves through the system very rapidly we need to send a message to this administration to the people of panama and to the communist chinese that congress will not permit the security interests of the united states to be jeopardied because of some fantasy by the president that we are in a strategic partnership with the communist regime in beijing i would like to leave people with this one thought my father was a marine pilot he was a 20year career man a lieutenant colonel when i was a young boy we lived in japan and my father flew intelligence missions along the chinese coast we lived in a small compound outside of iwakuni japan which is a navy base there my father would fly along with other pilots right along the coast and photograph the coast of china this is in the 1950s he did so at great personal risk in fact my nextdoor neighbor this is when i was 10 years old my nextdoor neighbor was shot down by a communist chinese plane thank god that that person was not shot down and murdered by the communist chinese plane and there was not any question they were not using american technology to shoot down our neighbors this american pilot in the future when they shoot down american pilots that we will haunt us did we provide the technology necessary to kill those americans li 1100 i remember that very vividly i remember the tears and the sorrow of my nextdoor neighbor my playmates and the sense of hopelessness of the wife who was now left with the two children on her own to raise these kids and live her life without a loving husband i remember that very well i also remember that when a few years later my father he is passed away now perhaps one of the great things he did for our country was that he helped develop the navy way of dropping the atomic bomb to make this clear what happens is before if you drop a bomb from a plane like this a small plane cannot do it because it will blow up the plane but my father developed the system that the plane goes down a small jet aircraft can come down like this and loft the bomb ahead as the plane pulls around and heads in the opposite direction that was a most important development because after that was perfected americas aircraft carriers became strategic weapons and the formula in the cold war changed dramatically in favor of the united states because we now could deliver nuclear weapons throughout the world that did not just happen my father was taken out of a hospital bed when he described that to a general and given command of a squadron of hotshot pilots that they were going to develop that as soon as they could perfect that system with all speed because it meant so much to the security of our country he put his team together during that time period they worked and they pushed the limits and they pushed beyond the limits in order to perfect that system so that other american pilots would be safe when they delivered their weapons my mother told me something recently when my dad passed away about 11 months ago at the funeral my mother told me how during that time period my father was operating in total secrecy as was his whole operation and four young pilots lost their lives in developing this system four young pilots who were pushing the envelope beyond what they could flew too low flew too fast lost their lives one of these young pilots who died my mother remembers going to his home and his wife was there and it was their first wedding anniversary and they stood there my mother and my father telling this young wife the candlesticks on the table that her husband would never come home and they were never able to tell that wife why her husband had died the mission was top secret they could not let her know that her husband died developing a system that was so important to the national security of our country because it was that secret i do not know who that man was i do not know the names of the people who died during the cold war like that but there were many of them my nextdoor neighbor in japan these four young men they died protecting our country from communism and especially from the communist chinese we do not know their names and we owe them a great deal it is up to us to keep faith with those people we cannot let our country be in jeopardy after they paid so much of a price so dear a price for our security and to let some fantasy like a strategic partnership with the communist chinese put our country in jeopardy when so many people have sacrificed for our safety is a sin against our people"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today i rise to address the claim of some of my colleagues that gold mines get a free ride because they do not pay their fair share of federal royalties well when considering a federal tax increase on the mining industry we must always remind my tax and spend colleagues to take into account the adverse effect of such a tax increase on state and local tax revenues as well there is a direct correlation between increasing mining royalties or taxes and the reduction in mining activities the unintended consequence is that state and local governments suffer great tax losses by these resulting decreases in mining activities federal royalties are deductible from the income base on which many of these state taxes are levied this results in an even less tax dollar amount for state and local governments even a recent economic analysis shows that an 8 percent gross royalty would cost state and local governments hundreds of millions in tax revenues every year it becomes very clear that when a federal royalty is not in the best economic interests of this country or the mining industry we should avoid it abraham lincoln had the great foresight when he

wish to diminish federal control over education should cast an unenthusiastic yes vote for the academic achievement for all students freedom and accountability act straight as while this bill does increase the ability of state and local governments to educate children free from federal mandates and regulations and is thus a marginal improvement over existing federal law straight as fails to challenge the federal governments unconstitutional control of education in fact under straight as states and local school districts will still be treated as administrative subdivisions of the federal education bureaucracy furthermore this bill does not remove the myriad requirements imposed on states and local school districts by federal bureaucrats in the name of promoting civil rights thus a school district participating in straight as will still have to place children in failed bilingual education programs or face the wrath of the department of educations misnamed office of civil rights the fact that this bill increases however marginally the ability of states and localities to control education is a step forward as long as the federal government continues to levy oppressive taxes on the american people and then funnel that money back to the states to use for education programs defenders of the constitution should support all efforts to reduce the hoops through which states must jump in order to reclaim some of the peoples tax monies however there are a number of both practical and philosophical concerns regarding this bill while the additional flexibility granted under this bill will be welcomed by the ten states allowed by the federal overseers to participate in the program there is no justification to deny this flexibility to the remaining forty states after all federal education money represents the return of funds illegitimately taken from the american taxpayers to their states and communities it is the pinnacle of arrogance for congress to pick and choose which states are worthy of relief from federal strings in how they use what is after all the peoples money the primary objection to straight as from a constitutional viewpoint is embedded in the very mantra of accountability stressed by the drafters of the bill talk of accountability begs the question accountable to whom under this bill schools remain accountable to federal bureaucrats and those who develop the state tests upon which a participating schools performance is judged should the schools not live up to their bureaucraticallydetermined performance goals they will lose the flexibility granted to them under this act so federal and state bureaucrats will determine if the schools are to be allowed to participate in the straight as programs and bureaucrats will judge whether the states are living up to the standards set in the states fiveyear education planyet this is supposed to debureaucratize and decentralize education under the united states constitution the federal government has no authority to hold states accountable for their education performance in the free society envisioned by the founders schools are held accountable to parents not federal bureaucrats however the current system of leveling oppressive taxes on americas families and using those taxes to fund federal education programs denies parental control of education by denying them control over the education dollar because hewho pays the piper calls the tune when the federal government controls the education dollar schools will obey the dictates of federal educrats while ignoring the wishes of the parents in order to provide parents with the means to hold schools accountable i have introduced the family education freedom act the family education freedom act restores parental control over the classroom by providing american parents a tax credit of up to 3 000 for the expenses incurred in sending their child to private public parochial other religious school or for home schooling their children the family education freedom act returns the fundamental principal of a truly free economy to americas education system what the great economist ludwig von mises called consumer sovereignty consumer sovereignty simply means consumers decide who succeeds or fails in the market businesses that best satisfy consumer demand will be the most successful consumer sovereignty is the means by which the free society maximizes human happiness when parents control the education dollar schools must be responsive to parental demands that their children receive firstclass educations otherwise parents will find alternative means to educate their children furthermore parents whose children are in public schools may use their credit to improve their schools by helping tcr finance the purchase of educational tools such as computers or extracurricular activities such as music programs parents of public school students may also wish to use the credit to pay for special serv ices for their children it is the family education freedom act not straight as which represents the education policy best suited for a constitutional republic and a free society the family education freedom act ensures that schools are accountable to parents whereas straight as continues to hold schools accountable to bureaucrats since the straight as bill does give states an opportunity to break free of some federal mandates supporters of returning the federal government to its constitutional limits should support it however they should keep in mind that this bill represents a minuscule step forward as it fails to directly challenge the federal governments usurpation of control over education instead this bill merely gives states greater flexibility to fulfill federallydefined goals therefore congress should continue to work to restore constitutional govemment and parental control of education by defunding all unconstitutional federal programs and returning the money to americas parents so

does nothing to change that he would agree with me on that let me cite an example of why that could be a problem let us say that a health plan sets up its definition for getting psychiatric care saying that somebody has to try to commit suicide three times before one can qualify that may sound absurd but let us just say that the plan does that a little boy goes out a teenager tries to commit suicide once tries to commit suicide twice and finally on the third time commits suicide now under the boehner bill that plan followed its own criteria guess what under the boehner bill and under the bill that passed the senate there is no recourse because erisa says that the health plan can define medical necessity in any way they want to no matter how unreasonable the criteria are or seem to be by an independent panel review panel they still under erisa law cannot change the fact that a health plan could define medical necessity as the cheapest least expensive care we could take a little boy with a cleft palate a health plan could say all we are going to provide treatment for that is a plastic obturator a piece of plastic stuck up into that hole if that is the way the plans employer has

to this vast market has been vastly restricted in todays global marketplace we can no longer afford any restrictions on trade with the worlds largest population we must engage china to ensure that american companies and american workers have the tools to compete with other nations now already in these markets remember when america competes we win over the past year i have worked with the gentleman from california chairman of the committee on rules and a number of colleagues in support of extending permanent normal trading relations with china back home in new jersey i have met with hundreds of people from the business community to encourage them to organize and help spread the word about the benefits of increased trade with china that will bring benefits to the garden state and i would like to discuss for a few minutes a few of these items first extending permanent normal trade relations with china is a win for fairness this agreement forces china to adhere to our rulesbased trading system without an agreement there are no rules and we have no say whatsoever in how china conducts its business with the rest of the world secondly it is a win for unitedstates workers and businesses china is an incredibly important emerging market with more than a billion consumers thirdly trade with china is a win for american values inside china through free and fair trade america will not only export many products and services but we will deliver a good oldfashioned dose of our democratic values and free market ideas fourthly international trade whether it be with china or any other nation means jobs for my state of new jersey and that is the bottom line continued prosperity for all of us out of new jerseys 4 1 million member workforce almost 600 000 people statewide from main street to fortune 500 companies are employed because of exports imports and foreign direct investment currently china ranked as new jerseys ninth largest export destination in 1998 an increase from 13th in 1993 our garden state has exported 668 million in merchandise to china in 1998 more than double what was exported 5 years earlier with a formal trade agreement in practice imagine the potential as access to chinas vast markets is improved enormous opportunities exist for our states telecommunications h3400 co our environmental technology our health care industry our agriculture and food processing industries fifth and finally in the interest of world peace it is absolutely a mistake to isolate china a nation with the worlds largest standing army an estimated 2 6 million member

for reducing regional tensions along the taiwan strait and for avoiding a new arms race elsewhere in asia and throughout the world as i work to pass pntr for china i am fully aware of the

to weigh the risks of new programs and new ideas against the successful models and the record of their 49 counterparts and colleagues throughout the rest of the country and states are in a better position to act more swiftly than the federal government is states are closer to the people the elected officials are much more accountable than the bureaucrats down the street here from where we are here at the unitedstates department of education that is the front line the states are the front lines of education reform and states differ some states have a more decentralized approach where local school districts are able to innovate each further at a more local level some states are a little more centrally controlled at their state capitals but in no case should we ever not be willing to trust the future of our children and their ability to grow intellectually to a small group of folks here in washington d c over at the department of education whose goal today facilitated by this centralized governing types down at todays white house to collect this authority and power in washington d c to define the terms of quality to define how a dollar will be spent in a classroom and of course with the track record of the unitedstates department of education it is the last organization we should trust to get the nations precious resources and tax dollars to the children that we

their top priority we are hearing this around the country that parents care about how much money they are spending on taxes they care about the corruption and the lack of integrity we have seen in the

support of this resolution to prohibit the use of funds for the deployment of ground troops in yugoslavia unless specifically approved by congress now this does not prohibit ground troops from ever going into this area for combat but if the people of america are going to be sent into war it seems to me the representatives of the people of america should be in a position to approve that in fact i believe we should actually remove our forces from that area that are already there in the last 6 years the manner in which this administration has circumvented congress when it comes to deployment of the unitedstates military forces around the world has been unprecedented so it should come as no surprise that the house is here on the floor pleading to at least have a say in the process the president is the commanderinchief but congress should not relax in its role as a consultative partner when it comes to the deployment of our servicemen and women so i agree with this measure wholeheartedly but i want to talk about why i believe that we should not be there at all in any military exercise there should be a clear succinct mission and exit strategy similar to our successful efforts in desert storm the kosovo plan and i hesitate to even call it that much does not have a clear mission clear goals a way to measure accomplishment standards or an exit strategy for united states ground forces to enter that region i also believe a more stable environment must be achieved by diplomatic means this is not a desert our technological superiority will only give us so much of an advantage in the rugged terrain of yugoslavia it will not take only 4 days as it did in the gulf the serb army has entrenched itself over hundreds of years and unlike in iraq they appear to have complete loyalty to their leader mr milosevic in other words if we go into this hostile situation we will lose american troops look at the history hitler had many many divisions in yugoslavia during

in opposition to the resolution it is important for us i think to recognize what the jacksonvanik waiver does and what it does not do by law the underlying issue here is about immigration based on vietnams record of progress on immigration and its continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver will continue to promote freedom of immigration disapproval would undoubtedly result in the opposite the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations 5 years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationships this is in americas own shortterm and longterm national interests it builds on vietnams own policy of political and economic reintegration into the world this will be a lengthy and challenging process however now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam vietnam continues to cooperate fully with our priority efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting of american powmias the jacksonvanik waiver supports this process the jacksonvanik waiver certainly does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion on may 4 however this body passed a resolution condemning just such violations of human rights the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate and sign a new bilateral commercial trades agreement with vietnam congress will have an opportunity in the future whether to approve it or not and whether to grant ntr or not but that is a separate process the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver only keeps this process going nothing more renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not antomatically make american exports to vietnam eligible for possible coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs the waiver only allows american exports to vietnam to be eligible for such coverage the war with vietnam is over and we have embarked upon a new although cautious expanded relationship with vietnam now is not the time to reverse this constructive course accordingly this member urges a no vote on the resolution having summarized the key reasons to oppose the resolution this member would like to expand on a few of these points first the issue of emigration which indeed is what the jacksonvanik provision is all about since march of 1998 the united states has granted vietnam a waiver of the jacksonvanik emigration provisions of the trade act of 1974 as this is only an annual waiver the president decided on june 2 2000 the renew this extension because he determined that doing so would substantially promote greater freedom of emigration from that country in the future this determination was based on vietnams record of progress on emigration and on vietnams continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year as a result we are approaching the completion of many refugee admissions categories under the orderiy departure program odp including the resettlement opportunity for vietnamese returnees former reeducation camp detainees mccain amendment subprograms and montagnards the vietnamese government has also agreed to help implement our decision to resume the odp program for former unitedstates government employees which was suspended in 1996 the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver is an acknowledgment of that progress disapproval of the waiver would undoubtedly result in vietnams immediate cessation of cooperation second the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations five years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationship this policy is in americas own short and longterm national interest it builds on vietnams o n policy of political and economic reintegration into the world in the judgment of this member this will be a lengthy and challenging process however he suggests that now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam third over the past five years vietnam has increasingly cooperated on a wide range of issues the most important of these is the progress and cooperation in obtaining the fullest possible accounting of americans missing from the vietnam war those members who attended the briefing by the distinguished ambassador to vietnam a former prisoner of war and former member of this body the honorable pete peterson learned of the significant efforts to which vietnam is now extending to address our concerns regarding the pow mia issue including their participation in remains recovery efforts which are physically very dangerous fourth the jacksonvanik waiver does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion however our experience has been that isolation and disengagement does not promote progress on human rights new sanctions including the symbolic disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver only strengthens the position of the communist hardliners at the expense of those in vietnams leadership who are inclined to support more openness engagement with vietnam has resulted in some improvements in vietnams human rights practices though we still remain disappointed at the very limited pace and scope of such reforms as this member mentioned on may 4 2000 this body adopted a resolution condemning vietnams human rights record given the strong reaction to our resolution by hanoi it is evident that our actions and concems did not go unnoticed fifth the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with any new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status however with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate a new bilateral commercial trade agreement with vietnam this agreement was signed two weeks ago in washington in the opinion of this member this agreement is in our own short and long term national interest vietnam remains a very difficult place for american firms to do business vietnam needs to undertake additional fundamental economic reforms this new bilateral trade agreement will require vietnam to make these reforms and will result in increased american exports supporting jobs here at home in a separate process with a separate vote congress will have to decide whether to approve or reject this new trade agreement and to grant ntr status to vietnam given that the agreement has yet to even be transmitted to congress and there are only a limited number of legislative days before the bodys scheduled adjoumment this member believes that these decisions will not be made until the 107th congress meets next year thus the jacksonvanik waiver simply ensures that the modest trade opportunities currently available to american businesses will continue until congress considers the agreement sixth contrary to the claims of some opponents of the jacksonvanik waiver renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not automatically make american investment in and exports to vietnam eligible for coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs such as those administered by the overseas private investment corporation the exportimport bank and the unitedstates department of agriculture the waiver only allows american exports and investments to be eligible for such coverage each must still face separate individual reviews against each programs relevant criteria americans must conclusively recognize that the war with vietnam is over with the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1995 the united states and vietnam embarked on a new relationship for the future it will not be an easy or quick process vietnam today remains a communist country with very limited freedoms for its citizens significant reforms must occur before relations can be truly normal the emotional scars of the vietnam war remain with many americans in the mid1960s this member was an infantry officer and intelligence officer with the first infantry division within a month of completing my service members of my tightknit detachment of that division were in vietnam and taking casualties the first night after arrival like other vietnamera veterans this member has emotional baggage a great many americans have emotional baggage about vietnam but this member would suggest that it is time to get on with our bilateral relationship and not reverse course on vietnam passing this resolution of disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver would represent yet another reflection of animosities of the past at a time when vietnam is finally looking ahead and making changes towards its integration into the international community a retrenchment on our part by this disapproval resolution is not in americas short and long term national interests accordingly this member strongly urges the rejection of house joint resolution 99"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as the 106th

certainly every first responder in this country a debt of gratitude a vote of thanks protecting public safety and public property is a brave calling we certainly should as a congress thank those individuals for the great job they did yesterday up in emmitsburg it was a day of remembrance but it was also a day of celebration because these individuals contributed so much in the spirit of honor and duty i am a strongbeliever that everyone should be a supporter of their community should try in some way to make their individual communities a little bit better by contributing by being in public service by being on the fundraising committee contributing an effort to help others when they need help it seems to me that cynicism has just spread too far across this country and there are too many that now consider duty and honor to be just words relics of the past but these men and women our first responders our police and firemen especially in yesterdays dedication they believed in duty they believed in commitment they believed in community and certainly these quali ties in first responders across the nation deserve more support from this congress now we call them first responders because and i will give a couple of examples when we turned on our television last spring to the terrifying situation at columbine high school who did we see on that television set it was the first responders that got there first the firefighters were there first whether it is wildfires or earthquakes or tornadoes or fires of unimaginable danger and stress or when it is a beloved kitten going up a tree or when you need help for a fundraising in the community it is these firefighters that are there they are willing to make the difference they are willing to give their time and the effort we have got 32 000 fire departments in the united states we have got 103 million first responders eighty percent of those first responders are volunteers volunteers that go and risk their lives to protect lives and safety and support their community i think they embody the beliefs of the founders of our country who were deeply committed to the idea that the individual had an obligation to the community that our country needed its domestic defenders our firefighters our first responders every bit as much as it needed a national defense our thanks certainly should go out not only to these firefighters but their loved ones who experienced the tremendous effort the sacrifice that these firefighters have made for their communities stories where firefighters made the difference are in almost every home and every community they are certainly in my home where the firefighters came to my farm and saved not only property but the lives of a lot of my cattle on that farm as far as i am concerned they are the champions we can never fully thank and speeches like this speech tonight or speeches up in emmitsburg never are going to be adequate enough to thank those individuals that made that kind of sacrifice if there is any lesson that we can take as americans from those in our communities that contribute so much to make sure that we also make an effort to their memory to try to do our duty in helping others in helping our community in trying to do something to make our communities better and help the lives of the people that we know a little better that is what we should do"]]}
