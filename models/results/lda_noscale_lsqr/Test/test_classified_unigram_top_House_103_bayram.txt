mass that stretches itsconstitutional authority to the limit how bad is it this year with the introduction of his budget bill clinton claimed his administrations policies had solved the budget crisis his director of omb leon panetta stated that republicans would have killed to be able to offer this budget and we have been exposed to democrat after democrat crowing about the strength of the economy and their success at cutting the deficit what were they all cheering about according to clintons budget the deficit will fall to 175 billion next year then it will rise to 182 billion in 1997 256 billion in 2001 and 365 billion in 2004 in washington this is considered success obviously something stronger is needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the balanced budget amendment first they fear a balanced budget amendment will tie the hands of congress and force it to cut some programs in order to fund others in other words they fear that congress will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second there are those groups who question the effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work or not the answer is the balanced budget amendment will establish the framework under which congress will have to make its spending decisions congress will still have to make the spending decisions but it will be done without the openended funding option now available this is the third time in the last 4 years the house will vote on a balanced budget amendment four years ago opponents of the balanced budget

for that change and rightly so but they also want us to preserve the excellence and the choice they have come to expect and they dont want to see their health care costs go down only to see their taxes go up but as weve shown tonight in this debate all the canadian system can claim is that everyone has access to the system but you have to stop and ask yourself what is the quality of the system how long will i have to wait to getthe test or procedure i need how much more will i pay in taxes they promise that theyll be able to expand access to everyone and no one will have to pay more but remember what your mother told you if it sounds too good to be true it is they cite government estimates and reports produced by the cbo and gao but remember the government has never correctly estimated the cost of its programs thats why congress keeps going back to hardworking americans to ask them to pay more in taxes this case is no different their sole cost containment mechanism is simply to have the government say well have lower costs next year and then forbid hospitals from getting the latest and best equipment but is that how we want costs lowered fortunately there are other options out there if we want to control costs we should target the key cost drivers we should reform our malpractice system to eliminate the unnecessary procedures that are done simply to protect the provider if theyre dragged into court we should adopt a single insuranceform and electronic billing so that administrative costs are lowered we should tighten our fraud laws to eliminate this cost in our system we should reform our antitrust laws so that communities have the opportunity to coordinate the delivery of health care no longer will each hospital have to buy the latest and often most expensive diagnostic tool and if we want someone to control costs it should be the consumer in consultation with his her physician who decides if a treatment is appropriate or not we should allow the creation of medical savings accounts or medisave accounts that are integrated with a catastrophic plan let me explain how this would work on average employers nationwide pay 4 500 per year to buy health coverage for an employee family under our legislation employers would be encouraged to take 1 500 of that 4 500 and purchase a major medical insurance policy that would give employers everything they have now except the insurance policy would have a 3 000 deductible in other words the employee would pay the first 3 000 of health care costs the company would cover that possible 3 000 expense to employees by setting up a medical savings account in the employees name and depositing 3 000 in it each year whenever an employee needed medical service he would go get it wherever he chose and then would present a debit card and the bill would be paid from the 3 000 in his medical savings account anything he didnt spend at years end he would get to keep all of a sudden people have an incentive to make a choice between 200 at the emergency room or 50 at the doctors office because they are spending their own medical savings account money if a family had multiple illnesses the 3 000 would be spent from the account and then the major medical policy would kick in the employee is as well off as he is under the high premium low or no deductible plan he has today but if the employee be exercising prudence can save some of the 3 000 year after year that account can grow as a taxfree ira that money could then be used later in life to purchase longterm care or for other medical services the debate on health care reform has just begun whatever reforms we adopt we should make sure that it controls spiraling costs and makes health insurance affoidable most important we

the last notch even with a 4 percent increase over last years funding levels the fiscal year 1995 level will mean a 100 million cut in current services which will include separating 1 100 personnel

responsibilities so often heaped upon a willing but underfunded coast guard and you have a serious dilemma most recently the coast guard has been called to serve in an extra mission in the caribbean

refugee policies of the white house when fidel castro seized the opportunity to manufacture a refugee crisis of his own in nearby cuba the coast guard found themselves with 37 074 cubans to bring to safety at the height of this refugee crisis it was reported that every major cutter from the east coast had been committed to operations in the caribbean and some vessels had even been pulled from pacific northwest fisheries duties to fill in the gaps the cuban search and rescue mission alone occupied more than 3d coast guard cutters last year the incremental cost figure for haitian interdiction in the windward passage was 11 2 million this year although we have yet to receive a firm cost estimate for either the haiti or the cuba operation we can expect the costs to run much higher this week the coast guard picked up a new role port security for the united states occupation of haiti all of this paints a pretty clear picture of how the smallest of our armed forces has been

serious red flags about the costs of governmentrun health care in 190 this nation spent 4 billion on health care in 1960 total national health expenditures were 27 1 billion in 1965 the year government became a health service payor for millions of americans through medicare and medicaid national health spending had increased to 41 6 billion over the next 15 years national health spending quintupled reaching more than 250 billion in 1980 over the next decade health spending more than doubled again and by 1991 this nation was spending 751 8 billion on health care put another way in 1960 we spent 7 8 percent of our gross domestic product on health care by 1991 that number was 14 1 percent not only has governments entry into a major portion of our health care market not had a positive effect on the cost of care but rather many of us believe governments intrusion into the marketplace has been a major factor in the enormous increase in health spending simply put government control tends to inflate rather than lower costs the president keeps telling us that his health reform plan will control health spending while ensuring that everyone has health care and bringing down the national debt if it sounds too good to be true that is because it is even the congressional budget office which was under enormous political pressure to provide a favorable review of the clinton plan has found that under the best of circumstancesthat is if price controls are 100 percent effectivethe clinton health plan will generate additional deficits of 130 billion over the next 5 years when has anything the government does been anywhere close to 100 percent effective a more realistic review conducted by the wellrespected policy firm of kpmg peat marwick found the clinton plan will likely add 579 billion to the national debt in the next 7 years if its price controls are 50 percent effectivewhich is also a stretch for the federal government as we look at other analyseslike those that predict massive job loss under the clinton plan and thosethat show the presidents approach has severely underestimated the costs of the new health entitlement he promisesits no wonder americans are increasingly rejecting the clinton plan the answer to those two central questions is becoming loud and clear americans do not want government making their health care decisions and they cannot afford it either and they know it and they are asking us to look at the other choices"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today we will vote on the largest tax increase in american history the congressional budget office

needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the balanced budget amendment first they fear a balanced budget amendment will tie the hands of congress and force it to cut some programs in order to fund others in other words they fear that congress will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second there are those groups who question the effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work or not the answer is the balanced budget amendment will establish the framework under which congress will have to make its spending decisions congress will still have to make the spending decisions but it will be done without the openended funding option now available this is the third time in the last 4 years the house will vote on a balanced budget amendment four years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that congress didnt need the amendment to balance our budget we have the power right now they argued to deal with our deficit without amending the constitution the house defeated the amendment by seven votes since then the federal debt has grown by over 1 trillion two years ago opponents of the balanced

systemwe must expand access and control costs they are impatient for that change and rightly so but they also want us to preserve the excellence and the choice they have come to expect and they dont want to see their health care costs go down only to see their taxes go up but as weve shown tonight in this debate all the canadian system can claim is that everyone has access to the system but you have to stop and ask yourself what is the quality of the system how long will i have to wait to getthe test or procedure i need how much more will i pay in taxes they promise that theyll be able to expand access to everyone and no one will have to pay more but remember what your mother told you if it sounds too good to be true it is they cite government estimates and reports produced by the cbo and gao but remember the government has never correctly estimated the cost of its programs thats why congress keeps going back to hardworking americans to ask them to pay more in taxes this case is no different their sole cost containment mechanism is simply to have the government say well have lower costs next year and then forbid hospitals from getting the latest and best equipment but is that how we want costs lowered fortunately there are other options out there if we want to control costs we should target the key cost drivers we should reform our malpractice system to eliminate the unnecessary procedures that are done simply to protect the provider if theyre dragged into court we should adopt a single insuranceform and electronic billing so that administrative costs are lowered we should tighten our fraud laws to eliminate this cost in our system we should reform our antitrust laws so that communities have the opportunity to coordinate the delivery of health care no longer will each hospital have to buy the latest and often most expensive diagnostic tool and if we want someone to control costs it should be the consumer in consultation with his her physician who decides if a treatment is appropriate or not we should allow the creation of medical savings accounts or medisave accounts that are integrated with a catastrophic plan let me explain how this would work on average employers nationwide pay 4 500 per year to buy health coverage for an employee family under our legislation employers would be encouraged to take 1 500 of that 4 500 and purchase a major medical insurance policy that would give employers everything they have now except the insurance policy would have a 3 000 deductible in other words the employee would pay the first 3 000 of health care costs the company would cover that possible 3 000 expense to employees by setting up a medical savings account in the employees name and depositing 3 000 in it each year whenever an employee needed medical service he would go get it wherever he chose and then would present a debit card and the bill would be paid from the 3 000 in his medical savings account anything he didnt spend at years end he would get to keep all of a sudden people have an incentive to make a choice between 200 at the emergency room or 50 at the doctors office because they are spending their own medical savings account money if a family had multiple illnesses the 3 000 would be spent from the account and then the major medical policy would kick in the employee is as well off as he is under the high premium low or no deductible plan he has today but if the employee be exercising prudence can save some of the 3 000 year after year that account can grow as a taxfree ira that money could then be used later in life to purchase longterm care or for other medical services the debate on health care reform has just begun whatever reforms we adopt we should make sure that it controls spiraling costs and makes health insurance affoidable most important we should make sure reform leaves the patient in charge of the health care decisions not the government thats a prescription for real

this big money should be producing big results right wrong other than big misery to innocent haitian victims and united states businesses seeking to boost productivity in haiti our sanctions are having little impact on the targets of cedras and company in fact to the contrary the military junta in haiti is profiting from the embargo enriching itself through the sale of contraband often stolen from united states aid shipments aid workers are frustrated at every turn by the unintended consequences of the embargo particularly the rapid deterioration of infrastructure much needed food and medicine spoils on the docks for lack of machinery and trucks to move them we have seen the toll of such deterioration beforethe distended stomachs the reddish hair the sticklike limbsthese are the

called to serve in an extra mission in the caribbean since january the coast guard has rescued 24 733 haitians who were part of the mass exodus unleashed earlier this year by the cornblued impact of the embargo and the everevolving back and forth refugee policies of the white house when fidel castro seized the opportunity to manufacture a refugee crisis of his own in nearby cuba the coast guard found themselves with 37 074 cubans to bring to safety at the height of this refugee crisis it was reported that every major cutter from the east coast had been committed to operations in the caribbean and some vessels had even been pulled from pacific northwest fisheries duties to fill in the gaps the cuban search and rescue mission alone occupied more than 3d coast guard cutters last year the incremental cost figure for haitian interdiction in the windward passage was 11 2 million this year although we have yet to receive a firm cost estimate for either the haiti or the cuba operation we can expect the costs to run much higher this week the coast guard picked up a new role port security for the united states occupation of haiti all of this paints a pretty clear picture of how the smallest of our armed forces has been repeatedly called upon to carry out extraordinary duties which are generally not anticipated in the authorizations and appropriations we pass here all indications are that this trend will continue but without more xealistic funding something will eventually have to give i dont believe that most americans are willing to give up on ongoing drug interdiction operations search and rescue operations fisheries law enforcement navigable waterway management or any of the other vital operations the coast guard performs while i know this amendment
