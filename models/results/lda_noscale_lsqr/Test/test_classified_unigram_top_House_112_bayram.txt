jobs their policies are developing bigger jobs bigger government here in washington d c so much so that the only city in this country that real estate prices have not gone down is washington d c

because we have excessive and frivolous lawsuits against our own energy production and it has significantly delayed and in many cases prevented our energy resources from reaching the american marketplace h r 1032 the relief act doesnt stop people from having their day in court but what it would do is it would allow the environmental wackos that are trying to stop energy production here in this country from having this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from the frivolous lawsuits by allowing the prevailing party to be able to seek legal fees and other expenses under the act this

simple it really does you know the last time our country had the amount of spending that we see happening right now was actually in the lead up to world war ii and ive talked a lot about cutting and reducing government overspending and government growth it needs to be done in the last 3 years the what we call discretionary spending the money that has to be appropriated annually has increased by over 80 percent federal employment has increased by 10 percent in about that same time so government spending has grown and people are saying that the way tonot people my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the president are saying that the reason we have stagnant job opportunities is because we havent spent enough well i listed earlier the stimulus the bailouts the auto bailouts the health care bill all this spending thats taken place and were still where we are now and people say well it happened during world war ii we spent a ton of money and then coming out of that we grew jobs the difference the big difference was coming out of world war ii the last time our debt to gdp ratio was near where it is now the difference was and the thing that saved us was the immediate cuts right we cut government spending back but we grew jobs we literally made things here in america you know why we had an environment that fostered job creation we had an environment that cultivated

mckeon for his hard work and his steady leadership on this bill as well as the ranking member mr smith of washington for continuing the timehonored tradition of close cooperation and bipartisanship when it comes to defense and producing this conference report i also thank the professional staff which has worked closely together on literally hundreds of very difficult and often very technical issues and has done so cooperatively in an extremely responsible manner im very proud that the armed services committee produced a bill in a very bipartisan manner im proud of the floor of the house who voted and passed in a bipartisan way this bill back in may the senate has finally decided to pass the bill in december that the senate has passed a bill is commendable it is unusual but it is also commendable the fact that they have done this here gives us an opportunity of passing one of the few bills that must be done in every session of congress the senates procrastination on this effort is one of the things that is worrisome i only hope that in the years to come the senate majority leadership will return to acting expeditiously deliberately and in a more timely manner in something that is this important it is actually a testament to the competency and professionalism of the house armed services committee staff the house leadership staff and the rules committee staff that this enormous and complex conference agreement could be rescued at the end of what is becoming an otherwise contentious lameduck session in our rules committee meeting the other day we had the opportunity of having mr hastings and others refer to the constitution it is very significant that in the beginning of the constitution the preamble that we talked about creating a more perfect union a more perfect union is not a grammatical flaw that was introduced by the founding fathers it had a specific historical context it also talked about preserving or promoting domestic tranquility which had also a specific historical context which had nothing to do with america being sedate or tranquil it had something to do with the specific concept of private property it also talked about promoting general welfare even though they had a uniquely different idea of the word general than we have today but in providing in the intermediary with all these provisions is also the word that we are supposed to provide for the common defense it was not unusual that that word was in there put in by gouverneur morris and the rest of them when the founding fathers met to write our constitution they were looking at the historical milieu of the day and the concepts that were going on at that time they responded in a way to try to make sure that they solved the problems of the day in a way that would never come up again the concept of providing for the common defense became one of the core constitutional responsibilities that was extremely significant we had won the revolutionary war but we had alsoseveral of the statesviolated the treaty with britain the inability of some states to protect tory property had given the british the reason to continue to have armed british soldiers on american soil or british forts on american soil we could not under the articles of confederation control our borders the british were arming subgroups coming in here to do more than just destroy our domestic tranquility but also to take down and harm the lives of americans it seems some things never change but the articles of confederation and congress could not respond to this they had an army of only 700 people there was no navy to control the shipping or protect our shipping rights the articles of confederation and congress realized what we should also realize that if we do not have an adequate and strong defense not only can we not militarily defend this country but we dont have the ability of diplomatically trying to reach solutions to problems without resorting to military efforts they realized that this was one of the flaws of america when they wrote the constitution so it is not unusual for them to specifically put in here that one of the responsibilities that this house has is to provide for the common defense it is not unusual that in article i section 8 there are 17 clauses seven of those 17 clauses as well as the introduction talk about the necessity of military defense and military preparedness for this country they recognized how significant that was not just for defending militarily but also for the future and the diplomatic abilities of the future united states this bill deals with one of the few core constitutional responsibilities that we had fortunately over the past 51 years congress has been able to come together in an amazingly bipartisan way to come up with a defense authorization bill that provides our defense agencies the ability to function to train to equip our forces and to provide for our military personnel and their families we are betting if we do not do this that the largescale threats to our national security will be so far in the future we can just sort of tread water i hope sometimes that they are right but that treading would not be what the founding fathers would look at as providing for the common defense in a real world there would be what i would consider to be a more significant and effective bill but were not dealing with the real world we are dealing though with realworld issues part of the issue is that we are looking at a world that is extremely dangerous for uswe do not know what the future enemy will beand we are also dealing with a world in which we are continually trying to diminish our military presence our navy is smaller than it has been since 1917 our army will be smaller than it was at the beginning of world war ii our air force is the smallest it has ever been in the history of this country with the oldest planes that weve ever had those issues are issues that are significant they are important and they must be addressed and those are going to be ongoing longterm issues this particular bill does not do as much to address that particular problem and give us the security of the future as i wish it could do thats only because we are not dealing in a perfect world where we can establish the setting that we wish to do we have to deal with the setting in which we find ourselves having said that there are a lot of things in this particular conference report and in the housepassed bill which are very very positive and they do move us forward as we continue the

so many people in somalia or im sure anywhere in the world had who are you why are you doing it explain that to me again the spirit was kind of catching and they would participate in all kinds of little volunteer activities and things that they hadnt necessarily thought of doing themselves of course the peace corps volunteers are not representatives of the american government they are representatives of the american people that was always emphasized very very strongly to all of us as part of our peace corps training the way we were living was among the people not behind these diplomatic bunkers that we sometimes see in the world today youre experiencing life in the country in which youre serving one thing just as an example is that peace corps volunteers of course do their assignments but theyre also people who do volunteer work of one kind or another one of the big hits was when i was in mogadishu in the peace corps i was with two other people who were peace corps lawyers at that time and there were about 50 60 people who were teachers some were community health workers and some were community school construction workers they would come to mogadishu for a couple days off for vacation time when school was down that kind of thing and five or six of them got together and started playing some american young peoples music and the next thing you know they

180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from

time that we have raised the debt ceiling since 1962 seventyfive times it has been raised this is the 76th time yet it is the very first time that we have done so while making corresponding cuts in spending that exceed the ceiling increase to most of us this is just good common sense its the only responsible thing to do yet 75 times before no connection was made between the debt ceiling and

down or moved elsewhere to be more competitive weve got to allow job growth i mean it sounds simple it really does you know the last time our country had the amount of spending that we see happening right now was actually in the lead up to world war ii and ive talked a lot about cutting and reducing government overspending and government growth it needs to be done in the last 3 years the what we call discretionary spending the money that has to be appropriated annually has increased by over 80 percent federal employment has increased by 10 percent in about that same time so government spending has grown and people are saying that the way tonot people my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the president are saying that the reason we have stagnant job opportunities is because we havent spent enough well i listed earlier the stimulus the bailouts the auto bailouts the health care bill all this spending thats taken place and were still where we are now and people say well it happened during world war ii we spent a ton of money and then coming out of that we grew jobs the difference the big difference was coming out of world war ii the last time our debt to gdp ratio was near where it is now the difference was and the thing that saved us was the immediate cuts right we cut government spending back but we grew jobs we literally made things here in america you know why we had an environment that fostered job creation we had an environment that cultivated entrepreneurs we grew jobs here in america because we made things here we produced things again in

allowed some of those companies i mentioned in my district to create their biomass facilities because then we could create jobs because wed have a biomass facility up and running we would be taking

of washington for continuing the timehonored tradition of close cooperation and bipartisanship when it comes to defense and producing this conference report i also thank the professional staff which has worked closely together on literally hundreds of very difficult and often very technical issues and has done so cooperatively in an extremely responsible manner im very proud that the armed services committee produced a bill in a very bipartisan manner im proud of the floor of the house who voted and passed in a bipartisan way this bill back in may the senate has finally decided to pass the bill in december that the senate has passed a bill is commendable it is unusual but it is also commendable the fact that they have done this here gives us an opportunity of passing one of the few bills that must be done in every session of congress the senates procrastination on this effort is one of the things that is worrisome i only hope that in the years to come the senate majority leadership will return to acting expeditiously deliberately and in a more timely manner in something that is this important it is actually a testament to the competency and professionalism of the house armed services committee staff the house leadership staff and the rules committee staff that this enormous and complex conference agreement could be rescued at the end of what is becoming an otherwise contentious lameduck session in our rules committee meeting the other day we had the opportunity of having mr hastings and others refer to the constitution it is very significant that in the beginning of the constitution the preamble that we talked about creating a more perfect union a more perfect union is not a grammatical flaw that was introduced by the founding fathers it had a specific historical context it also talked about preserving or promoting domestic tranquility which had also a specific historical context which had nothing to do with america being sedate or tranquil it had something to do with the specific concept of private property it also talked about promoting general welfare even though they had a uniquely different idea of the word general than we have today but in providing in the intermediary with all these provisions is also the word that we are supposed to provide for the common defense it was not unusual that that word was in there put in by gouverneur morris and the rest of them when the founding fathers met to write our constitution they were looking at the historical milieu of the day and the concepts that were going on at that time they responded in a way to try to make sure that they solved the problems of the day in a way that would never come up again the concept of providing for the common defense became one of the core constitutional responsibilities that was extremely significant we had won the revolutionary war but we had alsoseveral of the statesviolated the treaty with britain the inability of some states to protect tory property had given the british the reason to continue to have armed british soldiers on american soil or british forts on american soil we could not under the articles of confederation control our borders the british were arming subgroups coming in here to do more than just destroy our domestic tranquility but also to take down and harm the lives of americans it seems some things never change but the articles of confederation and congress could not respond to this they had an army of only 700 people there was no navy to control the shipping or protect our shipping rights the articles of confederation and congress realized what we should also realize that if we do not have an adequate and strong defense not only can we not militarily defend this country but we dont have the ability of diplomatically trying to reach solutions to problems without resorting to military efforts they realized that this was one of the flaws of america when they wrote the constitution so it is not unusual for them to specifically put in here that one of the responsibilities that this house has is to provide for the common defense it is not unusual that in article i section 8 there are 17 clauses seven of those 17 clauses as well as the introduction talk about the necessity of military defense and military preparedness for this country they recognized how significant that was not just for defending militarily but also for the future and the diplomatic abilities of the future united states this bill deals with one of the few core constitutional responsibilities that we had fortunately over the past 51 years congress has been able to come together in an amazingly bipartisan way to come up with a defense authorization bill that provides our defense agencies the ability to function to train to equip our forces and to provide for our military personnel and their families we are betting if we do not do this that the largescale threats to our national security will be so far in the future we can just sort of tread water i hope sometimes that they are right but that treading would not be what the founding fathers would look at as providing for the common defense in a real world there would be what i would consider to be a more significant and effective bill but were not dealing with the real world we are dealing though with realworld issues part of the issue is that we are looking at a world that is extremely dangerous for uswe do not know what the future enemy will beand we are also dealing with a world in which we are continually trying to diminish our military presence our navy is smaller than it has been since 1917 our army will be smaller than it was at the beginning of world war ii our air force is the smallest it has ever been in the history of this country with the oldest planes that weve ever had those issues are issues that are significant they are important and they must be addressed and those are going to be ongoing longterm issues this particular bill does not do as much to address that particular problem and give us the security of the future as i wish it could do thats only because we are not dealing in a perfect world where we can establish the setting that we wish to do we have to deal with the setting in which we find ourselves having said that there are a lot of things in this particular conference report and in the
