negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is that really the deal that the democrats would have us sign on to i

to administer all of these various programs and to report back to the congress on various aspects whether it is overlapping whether there is duplication whether there is money wasted whether there are insufficient funds in some programs and not others and then without waiting to see what that agency does assigns the money appropriates the money and spends the money this amendment puts the horse back in front where it belongs and really implements the will of the authors of this bill it says that this interagency commission which now has 30 days to report back to the congress under the wording of the bill would simply have 6 months to do so but that no money shall be spent under the appropriations until that agency which this bill creates reports back to the congress and determines whether or not there has been overlapping whether or not there has been overspending in any or underspending in any and if that report confirms the levels of funding that appear in the main body of this bill then that will be the end of it and the appropriation will take place if the money is too much in one area because of overlapping then the congress will have another opportunity to cut back on that one to meet the needs on the funding that is already in place members of the committee my amendment will do no harm to the commitment that we have to the homeless because the stream of funding that is already in the pipeline will continue to flow it simply means that in order to make sure that we have the right amounts in the right places that we are going to wait until the report of the

and procrastination on the part of congress relative to the budget process while we had an omnibus continuing resolution that contained all federal spending last year at least that cr was enacted by midoctober 1986 only a couple weeks after the start of the fiscal year this years bickering for 3 months after the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require each full year appropriations bill to be passed by congress individually and sent to the president in that form in lieu of separate movement of appropriations bills i have also cosponsored congressman mickey edwards bill h r 3199 that would require separation of any cr into the 13 individual appropriations bills upon presention to the president for signature i would hope that in view of the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many americans to sacrifice for the good of fiscal responsibility the least that members of congress can do is to contribute their 2 percent cola to that effort this legislation also contains language applauded by environmental groups that allows an 8month delay in sanctions for noncompliance with clean air act standards on ozone and carbon monoxide emissions this will pressure congress to reauthorize the clean air act this coming year instead of letting it slip into the next congress as some members had wished the cr also contains a provision that is very important to our nations dairy farmers the conferees on the agriculture appropriations section have included the text of my bill that will ensure that grammrudman sequestration does not unfairly impact dairy farmers back in 1986 congress and the president approved legislation i introduced h r 4188 public law 99260 to correct a flaw in the original grammrudman that would have cost dairymen 360 million in lost income in order to produce only 80 million in budget savings unfortunately in approving this years grammrudman fix the conferees neglected to incorporate this change senator bob kasten who was also instrumental in helping gain passage of public law 99260 back in 1986 inserted the language of h r 3344 in the senate version of the agriculture

energy act in the past decade the impact of these airborne pollutants upon our environment has become strikingly clear particularly in the northeast the decline of highelevation forests in vermont is well documented as is the acidification of hundreds of lakes throughout the northeast most recently sugar maple trees in vermont have been dying at an alarming rate acid rain is threatening to turn vermontthe green mountain state and the home of maple syrupinto the brown mountain state with sour syrup dead lakes and stunted trees despite the abundance of evidence vermonters are repeatedly told that more study is necessary but i dont think vermont sportsmen maple producers and outdoorsmen would agree and scientific experts dont either their message is the science does support the bill last august the epa released the preliminary results of its eastern lakes survey which showed startling new signs of damage in the east over 1 000 lakes are dead and over 4 000 lakes have virtually no buffering capacity left to neutralize acid rain the presitigious national academy of sciences has found a direct link between sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain damage in a march 1986 report the nas concluded that a casual relationship exists between so2 emissions and acidification of lakes in the admirondacks research conducted by the unitedstates forest service made public at a senate envionment and public works committee hearing last december turned up alarming declines in growth through the southeastern united states in yellow pines an important commercial species the regional survey of southern pine stands found growth reductions of 40 to 50 percent over the last 20 years this study is significant for two critically important reasons first it illustrates that acid rain is not exclusively a northeastern problem florida lakes and southern appalachian forest are dying while fragile alpine environments in the west are also threatened second this study is especially significant because it illustrates the economic costs of not acting to reduce acid rain opponents of the bill complain loudly about the cost of reducing emissions but they ignore the costs of inaction forest decline could have a devastating economic impact on the forest products industry in the east in addition a draft study prepared by epa brookhaven national laboratory and the army corps of engineers estimated that materials damage to statues monuments and historical buildings may be as high as 6 billion per year if congress weighs the costs of action against the costs of inaction i am confident that congress will move expeditiously and favorably on this legislation after 4 years and a number of approaches we have finally developed an acid rain bill which can pass the house of representatives h r 4567 as approved by the health and environment subcommittee will mandate the emissions reductions necessary to curb acid rain and it will give the states maximum flexibility in achieving these emissions reductions this bill has several advantages the first is flexibility the bill mandates tough new statewide average emissions standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the governor of each state will have the flexibility to choose from a wide array of options to meet this statewide emissions standard the bill does not mandate scrubbers in many states switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur coal will be sufficient to meet the emissions standard by providing this flexibility h r 4567 will promote leastcost methods of meeting emissions standards and saving ratepayers millions of dollars the flexibility of h r 4567 also allows governors concerned about the loss of highsulfur coal jobs to preserve these jobs the second criterion is ratepayer protection the bill would create a pollution control trust fund with a small fee on fossil fuel power produced in or imported into the untied states this trust fund would be used to cap residential rate increases attributable to the bill to no more than 10 percent this fee would increase the average residential customers monthly rate by an average of only 25 to 50 cents per month the inclusion of this provision in the bill illustrates the willingness of the sponsors to reduce to the extent possible the regional inequity in rate impacts the third and most important criterion large and meaningful reductions recent scientific evidence suggests that reductions of sulfur dioxide alone is not enough to ensure the future protection of our forests lakes and streams in addition to a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide our bill requires a 4millionton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions nitrogen oxide is a precursor of ozone which has been linked to forest decline and crop damage in numerous studies nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by tightening emissions standards on cars and trucks the tough emissions reductions contained in h r 4567 will insure that our forests lakes and streams do not meet a fate similar to those in europe this is the year for acid rain legislation this approach has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the new england governors conference it has also been strongly endorsed by the league of women voters the league of conservation voters the sierra club the national audubon society the national clean air coalition

committee on the post office and civil service i am deeply concerned about the compensation which we provide to federal employees a vital part of that compensation package is health insurance coverage for federal employees and their families as we near the vote on the treasury postal service and general government appropriations bill for fiscal year 1989 i would like to remind my colleagues that the legislation we are being asked to approve would not permit a federal employee or the dependent of a federal employee to receive health insurance coverage for all medical options in the event she is raped or is the victim of incest the legislation permits coverage of abortion services only if the life of the woman would be endangered if the pregnancy is carded to term since we have not debated this language in several years i would like to submit for the record a letter concerning this provision written in 1981 by the representatives of 2 million federal and postal employees juty 20 1981 dfar repfisntativ on behalf of the two million federal and postal employees who are represented by the undersigned we are writing to ask that you oppose any attempts to restrict federal and postal workers health benefits coverage when the fiscal year 1982 treasury postal service and general government appropriations bill is considered on the house floor within the next two weeks twice in the past year the federal employees health benefits program feiud has come under attack through an mnendment sponsored by representative john ashbrook rohlo which would have prohibited the payment of administrative expenses of any federal employee health insurance plan which provides coverage for abortions and related medical conditions we believe that the ashbrook restriction constitutes an unwarranted attempt by the congress to inject itself into the collectivebargaining process by eliminating a medical benefit which federal employees have negotiated as part of their total compensation package presently the government has little involvement in the federal employees health benefits fehb program it merely negotiates the level of benefits and administers the program and the plans funds the government does not decide what kind of medical program or procedures will be covered this is done through negotiation with the carriers federal workers may choose from a variety of health insurance plans some of which do not provide coverage for even medically necessary abortions we believe that this freedom of choice in mediral plan selection must be preserved further in 1972 congress passed section 117 title vii of the civil rights act to provide that the federal government may not discriminate against its employees on the basis of race sex religion national origin or age in 1978 congress enacted the pregnancy dlscrimination act which redefined and clarified the definition of sex discrimination under title vii to include di crimination on the basis of pregnancy childbirth and related medical conditions the ashbrook amendment as adopted by the house on two occasions would deny medical benefits to females solely on the basis of their sex by mandating the elinination of health insurance coverage for conditions related to pregnancy this could reverse the effect of congressionally mandated bans on discrimination as reflected in the 1972 and 1978 acts in addition when on april 20 1979 the equal employment opportunity commission published its guidelines on the pregnancy discrimination act it stated that no employer would be in compliance with title vii if it reduced benefits prior to the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement if congress adopts the ashbrook amendment it will affect all collectivebargaining agreements in the federal sector immediately by requiring the renegotiation of health benefits contracts prior to the expiration of current collectivebargaining agreements the commission further stated that if an employer in this case the federal govern ment reduces benefits for one class of employees it must effect a concommitant reduction in benefits for all other classes of employees this would necessitate the total reconstruction of all federal employee health insurance contractscontracts which are statutorily included in the federal employees total com penation package twice in the past year the senate appropriations committee has

colleagues are continuing to operate the panama canal under extremely diffi cult circumstances during the turbulent and often violent times in panama these employ ees manage to travel to work on both sides of the canal to keep it running during this time of turmoil and unrest our american personnel should not be submitted to unnecessary hardships or dangers while most american personnel in panama have access to the military commissaries and exchanges few american employees of the panama canal commission have this privilege there is no good reason why these commission employees should be forced to travel into the cities where the unrest is at its peak to buy food while most other american citizens are safe on military bases with convenient shopping facilities available it is my understanding that by granting privilege to employees that their dependents also become entitled to use the commissaries and exchanges american military personnel have been on increased alert for several weeks and have been told avoid the downtown shopping areas because of the demonstrations and disturbances if the american military should avoid these areas it makes sense that all americans should avoid these areas yet we continue to require this small segment of our american personnel in panama to travel to the downtown market places to put food on the tables for their families many of my colleagues have received phone calls and letters from constituents who have family or relatives in panama they are concerned about the safety of their loved ones and have received communications from panama that describe the hardships of traveling in dangerous areas to buy food and clothing there is legitimate concern for the safety of our american personnel who are forced to travel into the cities to shop this legislation would give them a temporary solution to ease one of the hardships caused by the civil unrest in that country this legislation is not intended to violate the panama canal treaties of 1977 nor is it a move to provoke general noriega this is a bill to allow our american personnel from the panama canal commission to use the unitedstates commissary and exchange facilities until the

massachusetts the fairness doctrine has been a regulation of the federal communications commission for over 25 years it has been challenged studied threatened and bantered about for the last several years over the last 2 years the fcc has undertaken an effort to repeal the fairness doctrine that effort has sparked the current debate the legislation before us today is intended to settle the debate by codifying the fairness doctrine into our communications laws it is important to note however that the debate is not simply a legislative issue the doctrine is currently subject to court challenge and quite frankly it will be settled in the court i believe by codifying the doctrine it actually assists the courts in ruling on the doctrines constitutionality i understand that the communications laws place special duties and privileges with broadcasters this unique treatment arises from the right to broadcast given by the government to a chosen few the broadcaster accepts an obligation to the community when he receives his license broadcasters are obliged and licensed to serve their communities fair and complete news is inherent in such public service it is unfortunate that we must resort tc any form of government requirementc for enforcing that obligation but i also acknowledge that the fair ness doctrine is not an overly burden some restriction imposed by the gov eminent as presently administerec under the current state of technolog3 and the market the doctrine does vest broad editorial responsibility with the broadcaster with appropriate deference given to the good faith and reasonable judgment of licensees only a handful of complaints are actually processed by the government under current circumstances it is not an intrusive program of government censorship or control technology has brought us all sorts of alternative electronic means to reach the public but at this time alternative sources simply do not permeate the electronic horizon sufficiently for us to conclude at this moment that wouldbe broadcasters have adequate opportunities to reach the public through these budding technologies not only is technology changing but so is the broadcast industry i

a letter that was sent by 67 members of this house to the president of the united states urging him to begin negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to

the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require each full year appropriations bill to be passed by

separation of any cr into the 13 individual appropriations bills upon presention to the president for signature i would hope that in view of the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many americans to sacrifice for the good of fiscal responsibility the least that members of congress can do is to contribute their 2 percent cola to that effort this legislation also contains language applauded by environmental groups that allows an 8month delay in

northeast the decline of highelevation forests in vermont is well documented as is the acidification of hundreds of lakes throughout the northeast most recently sugar maple trees in vermont have been dying at an alarming rate acid rain is threatening to turn vermontthe green mountain state and the home of maple syrupinto the brown mountain state with sour syrup dead lakes and stunted trees despite the abundance of evidence vermonters are repeatedly told that more study is necessary but i dont think vermont sportsmen maple producers and outdoorsmen would agree and scientific experts dont either their message is the science does support the bill last august the epa released the preliminary results of its eastern lakes survey which showed startling new signs of damage in the east over 1 000 lakes are dead and over 4 000 lakes have virtually no buffering capacity left to neutralize acid rain the presitigious national academy of sciences has found a direct link between sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain damage in a march 1986 report the nas concluded that a casual relationship exists between so2 emissions and acidification of lakes in the admirondacks research conducted by the unitedstates forest service made public at a senate envionment and public works committee hearing last december turned up alarming declines in growth through the southeastern united states in yellow pines an important commercial species the regional survey of southern pine stands found growth reductions of 40 to 50 percent over the last 20 years this study is significant for two critically important reasons first it illustrates that acid rain is not exclusively a northeastern problem florida lakes and southern appalachian forest are dying while fragile alpine environments in the west are also threatened second this study is especially significant because it illustrates the economic costs of not acting to reduce acid rain opponents of the bill complain loudly about the cost of reducing emissions but they ignore the costs of inaction forest decline could have a devastating economic impact on the forest products industry in the east in addition a draft study prepared by epa brookhaven national laboratory and the army corps of engineers estimated that materials damage to statues monuments and historical buildings may be as high as 6 billion per year if congress weighs the costs of action against the costs of inaction i am confident that congress will move expeditiously and favorably on this legislation after 4 years and a number of approaches we have finally developed an acid rain bill which can pass the house of representatives h r 4567 as approved by the health and environment subcommittee will mandate the emissions reductions necessary to curb acid rain and it will give the states maximum flexibility in achieving these emissions reductions this bill has several advantages the first is flexibility the bill mandates tough new statewide average emissions standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the governor of each state will have the flexibility to choose from a wide array of options to meet this statewide emissions standard the bill does not mandate scrubbers in many states switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur coal will be sufficient to meet the emissions standard by providing this flexibility h r 4567 will promote leastcost methods of meeting emissions standards and saving ratepayers millions of dollars the flexibility of h r 4567 also allows governors concerned about the loss of highsulfur coal jobs to preserve these jobs the second criterion is ratepayer protection the bill would create a pollution control trust fund with a small fee on fossil fuel power produced in or imported into the untied states this trust fund would be used to cap residential rate increases attributable to the bill to no more than 10 percent this fee would increase the average residential customers monthly rate by an average of only 25 to 50 cents per month the inclusion of this provision in the bill illustrates the willingness of the sponsors to reduce to the extent possible the regional inequity in rate impacts the third and most important criterion large and meaningful reductions recent scientific evidence suggests that reductions of sulfur dioxide alone is not enough to ensure the future protection of our forests lakes and streams in addition to a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide our bill requires a 4millionton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions nitrogen oxide is a precursor of ozone which has been linked to forest decline and crop damage in numerous studies nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by tightening emissions standards on cars and trucks the tough emissions reductions contained in h r 4567 will insure that our forests lakes and streams do not meet a fate similar to those in europe this is the year for acid rain legislation this approach has been endorsed by a wide range of groups

remind my colleagues that the legislation we are being asked to approve would not permit a federal employee or the dependent of a federal employee to receive health insurance coverage for all medical options in the event she is raped or is the victim of incest the legislation permits coverage of abortion services only if the life of the woman would be endangered if the pregnancy is carded to term since we have not debated this language in several years i would like to submit for the record a letter concerning this provision written in 1981 by the representatives of 2 million federal and postal employees juty 20 1981 dfar repfisntativ on behalf of the two million federal and postal employees who are represented by the undersigned we are writing to ask that you oppose any attempts to restrict federal and postal workers health benefits coverage when the fiscal year 1982 treasury postal service and general government appropriations bill is considered on the house floor within the next two weeks twice in the past year the federal employees health benefits program feiud has come under attack through an mnendment sponsored by representative john ashbrook rohlo which would have prohibited the payment of administrative expenses of any federal employee health insurance plan which provides coverage for abortions and related medical conditions we believe that the ashbrook restriction constitutes an unwarranted attempt by the congress to inject itself into the collectivebargaining process by eliminating a medical benefit which federal employees have negotiated as part of their total compensation package presently the government has little involvement in the federal employees health benefits fehb program it merely negotiates the level of benefits and administers the program and the plans funds the government does not decide what kind of medical program or procedures will be covered this is done through negotiation with the carriers federal workers may choose from a variety of health insurance plans some of which do not provide coverage for even medically necessary abortions we believe that this freedom of choice in mediral plan selection must be preserved further in 1972 congress passed section 117 title vii of the civil rights act to provide that the federal government may not discriminate against its employees on the basis of race sex religion national origin or age in 1978 congress enacted the pregnancy dlscrimination act which redefined and clarified the definition of sex discrimination under title vii to include di crimination on the basis of pregnancy childbirth and related medical conditions the ashbrook amendment as adopted by the house on two occasions would deny medical benefits to females solely on the basis of their sex by mandating the elinination of health insurance coverage for conditions related to pregnancy this could reverse the effect of congressionally mandated bans on discrimination as reflected in the 1972 and 1978 acts in addition when on april 20 1979 the equal employment opportunity commission published its guidelines on the pregnancy discrimination act it stated that no employer would be in compliance with title vii if it reduced benefits prior to the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement if congress adopts the ashbrook amendment it will affect all collectivebargaining agreements in the federal sector immediately by requiring the renegotiation of health benefits contracts prior to the expiration of current collectivebargaining agreements the commission further stated that if an

of the panama canal commission and their families who do not currently have these privileges the situation in panama is one of uncertainty our military personnel are on alert status and demonstrations rock the major cities almost daily the news reports we see in the united states are filled with stories about the difficulties and disturbances the panamanian military under the control of general noriega has taken control of most of the governmentally operated businesses and most grocery stores and businesses across the country are closed to protect his strongarm tactics in washington we read about the hardships of the panamanian people and their struggle to maintain a democracy in the face of a strong military presence and of the increased harassment of the business community who sup port the democratically elected government of president delvalle through all of this turmoil the panama canal has remained operational and well maintained our american citizens who are working in panama along with their dedicated panamanian colleagues are continuing to operate the panama canal under extremely diffi cult circumstances during the turbulent and often violent times in panama these employ ees manage to travel to work on both sides of the canal to keep it running during this time of turmoil and unrest our american personnel should not be submitted to unnecessary hardships or dangers while most american personnel in panama have access to the military commissaries and exchanges few american employees of the panama canal commission have this privilege there is no good reason why these commission employees should be forced to travel into the cities where the unrest is at its peak to buy food while most other american citizens are safe on military bases with convenient shopping facilities available it is my understanding that by granting privilege to employees that their dependents also become entitled to use the commissaries and exchanges american military personnel have been on increased alert for several weeks and have been told avoid the downtown shopping areas because of the demonstrations and disturbances if the american military should avoid these areas it makes sense that all americans should avoid these areas yet we continue to require this small segment of our american personnel in panama to travel to the downtown market places to put food on the tables for their families many of my colleagues have received phone calls and letters from constituents who have family or relatives in panama they are concerned about the safety of their loved ones and have received communications from panama that describe the hardships of traveling in dangerous areas to buy food and clothing there is legitimate concern for the safety of our american personnel who are forced to travel into the cities to shop this legislation would give them a temporary solution to ease one of the hardships caused by the civil unrest in that country this legislation is not intended to violate the panama canal treaties of 1977 nor is it a move to provoke general noriega this is a bill to allow our american personnel from the panama canal commission to use the unitedstates commissary and exchange facilities until the political turmoil settles down this is not an unreasonable request in light of the current events in panama and i am confident that the government of president delvalle will understand the limited scope and humanitarian nature of our bill i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as stated h r 1934 provides for the fair reporting by broadcasters on controversial issues of public importance consideration of h r 1934 today provides the first opportunity for my good friend and colleague ed markey the new chairman of the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance to bring a subcommittee bill to the floor of the house of representatives i look forward to many such initiatives under the leadership of the gentleman from massachusetts the fairness doctrine has been a regulation of the federal communications commission for over 25 years it has been challenged studied threatened and bantered about for the last several years over the last 2 years the fcc has undertaken an effort to repeal the fairness doctrine that effort has sparked the current debate the legislation before us today is intended to settle the debate by codifying the fairness doctrine into our communications laws it is important to note however that the debate is not simply a legislative issue the doctrine is currently subject to court challenge and quite frankly it will be settled in the court i believe by codifying the doctrine it actually assists the courts in ruling on the doctrines constitutionality i understand that the communications laws place special duties and privileges with broadcasters this unique treatment arises from the right to broadcast given by the government to a chosen few the broadcaster accepts an obligation to the community when he receives his license broadcasters are obliged and licensed to serve their communities fair and complete news is inherent in such public service it is unfortunate that we must resort tc any form of government requirementc for enforcing that obligation but i also acknowledge that the fair ness doctrine is not an overly burden some restriction imposed by the gov eminent as presently administerec under the current state of technolog3 and the market the doctrine does vest broad editorial responsibility with the broadcaster with appropriate deference given to the good faith and reasonable judgment of licensees only a handful of complaints are actually processed by the government under current circumstances it is not an intrusive program of government censorship or control technology has brought us all sorts of alternative electronic means to reach the public but at this time alternative sources simply do not permeate the electronic horizon sufficiently for us to conclude at this moment that wouldbe broadcasters have adequate opportunities to reach the public through these budding technologies not only is technology changing but so is the broadcast industry i considered offering an amendment in the markup of h r 1934 by the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance to exempt radio from this bill because radio marketplace is so different than television such an amendment lacked support at that time however i remain concerned and i am pleased to support my colleague from new york mr green in his amendment to exempt radio one other issue concerns me and that is the references in the committee report to the fairness doctrine application to cable providers not now covered i do not recall one single mention of a fairness doctrine for cable during our hearing or markups my understanding is that h r 1934 merely codifies the existing fairness doctrine regulation for the time being and that is all any other notions of how it ought to be expanded are beyond the scope of h r 1934 as i understand it"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "at the outset let me first of all congratulate the chairman of the committee on the judiciary and the appropriate subcommittees along with the ranking minority members of those subcommittees for a piece of legislation that i think has long been needed in this country i am of course talking about the omnibus drug control bill it will go a long way ini beginning to build some controls on the streets and education with our young people that is so critically necessary to fight this national plague let me address myself though specifically to title vi subsqction 6503 this is an important issue and an important area and i have to believe that the subcommittee on crime in large part added a portion to this legislation that is if not needed at least unworkable i am talking about a 7day waiting period on handguns this morning i was privileged to introduce 115 rankandfile cops on the beat you could call them from over 27 states in this nation they came here to lobby they came here to lobby us membprs of congress on this legislation not in opposition to the omnibus crime control bill but certainly in opposition to this section because as they said so clearly this morning it will not deter the criminal it will be the honest lawabiding citizen that might be without a gun or that will be limited in his or her right to acquire a gun while the criminal the drug dealer on the street will still be bzying his gun from behind the bar for an exorbitant amount of money because he has it or out of the back of a car that moves into a community to sell handguns to young kids on the street that are pushing crack that is really the issue i hope as we debate this bill and as we move toward amendments that we will look at some reasonable alternatives that are valuable to us as we move to amend this important legislation i hope when we arrive at this section we will look most clearly at the mccollum alternative or the mccollum substitute that will devise a mechanism by which we will be able to track and identify those individuas who are criminals attempt ing to acquire a gun that really is the issue here to take guns away from criminals and not take guns away from lawabiding citizens or in sorne way to restrict the right of the individual lawabiding citizen to do so we have provided positive alternatives for the lawenforcement community alternatives that 115 rankandfile cops on the street supported and endorsed today as they came to lobby us here let us make the appropriate amendments pass this most important legislation for our country and hopefully improve the climate on the streets for the young people and for the lawabiding citizen"], [0.5, 0.0, 0,
