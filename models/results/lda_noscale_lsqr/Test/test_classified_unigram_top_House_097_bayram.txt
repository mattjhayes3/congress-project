poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the

union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the

voting which allows us to be there when we are not there and excessive staff which allows us to do things that we cannot do ourselves the upshot of all of this is that we do not pay attention to many of the bills in the subcommittee or committee stage because you go prepared to have hearings you go prepared to listen to the evidence you go prepared to make up your mind based on the evidence that is presented and maybe everybody there decides based on the evidence that is presented that there is one way to go but a chairman or someone else will pull the proxies out of his pocket and vote the opposite way for those people who never had the benefit of those hearings that were actually taken it then happens on the committee level where proxies are allowed to be voted then we come here on the floor of the house and we have bills that really are not in good shape what happens when we on the minority side i 850 attempt to bring amendments and some on the majority side bring amendments we get criticized by the leadership for slowing down the process and for attempting to put roadblocks in the legislative progress the fact is that much of the legislation is not being dealt within the subcommittee level the committee level and then by the rules we adopt on the floor which do not allow us to take care of those problems it is not being dealt with on the floor so the committee staffing goes beyond us picking up the cudgel thrown by the president of the united states to try to slim down government to its regular size so that we are fighting trim instead of being overweight and trying to slug ourselves through a fight that we cannot win it goes to the very question of how this institution operates if we are elected by the people to make those decisions we ought to make those decisions they should not be made by staffers who in some waysand there are many many good staffers i do not mean to say that there are notbut there is a certain feeling that develops after awhile when you are here long after the members are here when you stay on the committees and the subcommittees long after they do i had a freshman member come to me today and say during a hearing he and another member got together to bring up an amendment and they asked one of the counsel to come over the counsel said well have you checked with this staff person and that staff person and that staff person he named three staff people well if you have not checked with those staff people i would suggest that you not introduce this amendment during this markup proceeding now what does that

enough in removing obstacles to investment and productivity more than 53 percent replied no whien asked if the new tax bill will benefit their companies over 85 percent said yes cohvetsely on whether

apparent to everyone here that economic events will run their course if we simply allow them to that does not mean tampering with shortterm stopgap measures or raising taxes or revising the next tax

force budget study subcommittee this subcommittee produced a work product in the latter part of july wherein we identified 272 itqms where savings could be made in fiscal year 1982 these totaled some 52 billion we are not necessarily su~ggesting that these items should all be implemented we are saying that if the congress would assert the courage in this institution to make the cuts necessary to balance the budget these items among others certainly should be considered on previous days i have read very briefly through items relating to legislative 21 cuts judiciary 8 cuts executive office 4 cuts funds for the president 15 cuts agriculture 27 cuts commerce 8 cuts defense military 15 cuts defense civil 4 cuts education 9 cuts energy 13 cuts and health and human services 16 cuts today i would propose to read through a list of cuts for housing and urban development totaling 15 for some 3 304 249 600 and in the department of the interior 6 cuts totaling 297 557 300 the first item from hud is housing programs subsidized housing in this category we would allow 20 percent above fiscal year 1980 the proposal as it is in the present law would provide for a 51 4percent increase over the preceding year moreover the gao finds considerable overcommitment of funds due to inaccuracies in contracts we believe this is excessive and should not be tolerated if adopted this would save 1 421 941 800 in housing programs payments for operation of lowincome housing projects we would cut 10 percent from 1981 these projects have been illadvised illconceived and illmanaged we propose eliminating operation of september 24 1 981 rrentarks e 4437 the most wasteful portions of those projects and achieve savings of 215 080 000 housing programs congregate services would be eliminated funding authority for this program has already been deleted and remaining outlays should follow suit this would save if adopted 5 300 000 housing programs troubled project operation subsidy we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the additional funding of housing projects is redundant if the worst offenders would be deleted we could remove that redundancy this would save if adopted 57 399 200 housing programs lowrent housing loans and expenditures we would allow 20 percent above 1980 the current proposal is for an increase of 173 5percent increase from 1980 which is altogether in our judgment unnecessary and unreasonable if implemented this would save 51 473 400 government national mortgage association special assistance functions we would improve this by following the recommendations of the general accounting office for improving accounting procedures which if adopted for this program would save 22 700 000 onma emergency mortgage purchase assistance we would improve the servicing of multifamily mortgages and provide incentives for prompt payments this again is a recommendation of the general accounting office if adopted it is estimated to save 500 million community planning and development community development support assistance wve would cut 10 percent from proposed funding for block grants not including udag these grants have helped corporations and developers not the needy this would save 411 300 000 community planning and development community development support assistance we would eliminate udag funding to decaying inner cities which should be redeveloped under the concept of enterprise zones not out of subsidies from the public treasury if implemented and adopted this would save 500 million new community development corporation we would eliminate funding for this program because we feel it can be better financed in creation of enterprise zones if adopted this would save 37 117 000 neighborhoods voluntary associations and consumer protection interstate land sales we would eliminate this on the grounds that the federal government should never have gotten in to this area to begin with and n addition this regulatory body has expanded into the intrastate field as well which certainly is not justified if implemented this would save 300 000 fair housing and equal opportunity we would eliminate this on the grounds that it is unnecessary it should not be functioning as a separate program but rather as policy if adopted this would save 6 100 000 management and administration public assistance and income supplement we would allow a growth of 20 percent above 1980 currently proposed spending represents a 5 1 8percent increase from 1980 which we believe to be excessive if implemented this would save 19 572 800 management and administration law enforcement activities we would allow a 20percent growth above 1980 the proposed increase is unnecessary because of cutbacks in enforcement activities if implemented this would reduce spending by 1 570 400 finally for this category we would follow the recommendation of the general accounting office by correcting auditing procedures which if implemented would save 54 395 000 in the department of the interior the first item here of the six that are proposed departmentwide we would correct auditing procedures recommended by the general accounting office which if implemented would reduce spending for this category by 59 510 000 land and water resources elm range improvement we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by limiting further land acquisition if implemented this would save 1 350 000 land and water resources blm resource management we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by restricting regulation and management if implemented this would reduce spending by 24 482 500 land and water resources elm miscellaneous permanent appropriation general purpose fiscal assistance we would allow 20percent growth above what was spent in 1980 the current proposal allows a 74 4percent increase from 1980 which we perceive as unwarranted this if adopted would save 201 515 600 land and water resources water and power resource service general administration we would allow 20percent above 1980 the proposed 50 1percent increase from 1980 is in our judgment excessive and should not be tolerated this if implemented would reduce spending in fiscal year 1982 by 8 899 200 land and water resources office of water policy salaries and expenses we would eliminate this new agency on the grounds that it is not needed there is little justification for its existence in our opinion this if implemented would reduce spending by 1 800 000 to sum up this category of the department of interior these six items would result in spending 297 557 300 less in fiscal year 1982 for the department of housing and urban development the 15 items total 3 304 249 600 some members in this chamber may from time to time ask the question if it is so simple why do we not do it that is why do we not balance the budget why do we not assert the necessary independence to bring the discipline to bear to match the outgowith the income and remove one of the great obstacles to economic recovery of this country the answer to that question is puzzling but it is probably more political than anything else there is a drum beat that runs through these chambers which says that if the members exhibit the courage to cut the spending this will1 aggravate those people and organizations adversely affected and these same special interests who are cut down or cut off will retaliate against the offending members in the voting booth that philosophy has been driving this institution for almost a generation it still is the controlling philosophy in this chamber then you may ask what hope is there for the people of this country if we who have the stewardship of raising taxes and voting spending do not have the courage to match the outgo with the income i think one constructive way is to demonstrate that we can balance the budget of this nation in fiscal year 1982 while at the same time providing for the recognized needs of the downtrodden the poor the handicapped and the deprived in our society because when you analyze these items that i have been reading i challenge members to stand up and honestly say that we cannot do that because if we adopted this or that item we would be working against the genuine interests of the poor the downtrodden the handicapped and the deprived those who do not have the ability to fend for themselves i say to the members here look at these items carefully we have prepared them in all sincerity we as an institution cannot go on year after year spending more money then we take in in this fiscal year which will close in less than a week we will have probably gone into debt roughly 90 billion in the last 5 years we have added to our national debt over 300 billion notwithstanding the election of november 1980 the spending of the congress of the united states is today out of control the members of this institution do not have the discipline at least as they have exhibited it up to now to match the outgo with the income i think the constructive thing for us to do is to demonstrate with a work product of this type that we can cut spending we can cut our bureaucracy we can cut out waste fraud and abuse i think it is reasonable to

camps she said it all started in 1949 when her husband was arrested for being a member of a ukranian nationalist association and writing zamizdat the underground press he was sentenced to 30 years that began strokatakaravanskis long stuggle to secure freedom for her husband she petitioned the government and like her companion nadia svitlychny wrote of her husbands plight for the underground press in 1972 when the soviet government began staging mass arrests of ukranian intellectuals and artists these women fled to the caucasus in the north for safety unfortunately it was to no avail for the police were not long in catching them no reason was given for strokatakaravanskis arrest but she is certain it stemmed from her fight on behalf of her husband she spent 4 years at the labor camp before being released in december 1975 four more years elapsed while she waited for her husband to complete his 30year term today after half a lifetime of waiting and hoping the two have been reunited and reside in the united states the most tragic thing about the story that unfolded in my office yesterday was that for every one of these examples of abuse and incarceration by the soviet government that comes to light there are countless others that we never even hear about last week i met with a group of individuals who serve on my ethnic citizens advisory council in the lehigh valley and i was once again impressed at the insight and understanding that these americans have of world affairs especially regarding the unitedstates relationship with the soviet union and communistbloc countries i am saddened to hear some of the stories they tell which for the most part are unheard but nevertheless occur on a daily basis to thousands of innocent people whose only desire is a little freedom i would encourage my fellow members of congress to take the opportunity to seek out those individuals in their respective districts which have ethnic heritage and allow them through some mechanism to serve in an advisory capacity on both domestic and international issues my actions in the congress have benefited from the input i have received from my ethnic citizens advisory council and i am confident that many other members would benefit similarly while the united states must continue to speak out constructively for oppressed peoples of the world the unitedstatess r is moving in the opposite direction the soviets need to be reminded that the helsinki agreement redrew the boundaries of eastern europe in exchange for their guarantee that certain rights would be respected we and

this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal

listen to the evidence you go prepared to make up your mind based on the evidence that is presented and maybe everybody there decides based on the evidence that is presented that there is one way to go but a chairman or someone else will pull the proxies out of his pocket and vote the opposite way for those people who never had the benefit of those hearings that were actually taken it then

be excessive if implemented this would save 19 572 800 management and administration law enforcement activities we would allow a 20percent growth above 1980 the proposed increase is unnecessary because of cutbacks in enforcement activities if implemented this would reduce spending by 1 570 400 finally for this category we would follow the recommendation of the general accounting office by correcting auditing procedures which if implemented would save 54 395 000 in the department of the interior the first item here of the six that are proposed departmentwide we would correct auditing procedures recommended by the general accounting office which if implemented would reduce spending for this category by 59 510 000 land and water resources elm range improvement we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by limiting further land acquisition if implemented this would save 1 350 000 land and water resources blm resource management we would cut 10 percent from 1981 by restricting regulation and management if implemented this would reduce spending by 24 482 500 land and water resources elm miscellaneous permanent appropriation general purpose fiscal assistance we would allow 20percent growth above what was spent in 1980 the current proposal allows a 74 4percent increase from 1980 which we perceive as unwarranted this if adopted would save 201 515 600 land and water resources water and power resource service general administration we would allow 20percent above 1980 the proposed 50 1percent increase from 1980 is in our judgment excessive and should not be tolerated this if implemented would reduce spending in fiscal year 1982 by 8 899 200 land and water resources office of water policy salaries and expenses we would eliminate this new agency on the grounds that it is not needed there is little justification for its existence in our opinion this if implemented would reduce spending by 1 800 000 to sum up this category of the department of interior these six items would result in spending 297 557 300 less in fiscal year 1982 for the department of housing and urban development the 15 items total 3 304 249 600 some members in this chamber may from time to time ask the question if it is so simple why do we not do it that is why do we not balance the budget why do we not assert the necessary independence to bring the discipline to bear to match the outgowith the income and remove one of the great obstacles to economic recovery of this country the answer to that question is puzzling but it is probably more political than anything else there is a drum beat that runs through these chambers which says that if the members exhibit the courage to cut the spending this will1 aggravate those people and organizations adversely affected and these same special interests who are cut down or cut off will retaliate against the offending members in the voting booth that philosophy has been driving this institution for almost a generation it still is the controlling philosophy in this chamber then you may ask what hope is there for the people of this country if we who have the stewardship of raising taxes and voting spending do not have the courage to match the outgo with the income i think one constructive way is to demonstrate that we can balance the budget of this nation in fiscal year 1982 while at the same time providing for the recognized needs of the downtrodden the poor the handicapped and the deprived in our society because when you analyze these items that i have been reading i challenge members to stand up and honestly say that we cannot do that because if we adopted this or that item we would be working against the genuine interests of the poor the downtrodden the handicapped and the deprived those who do not have the ability to fend for themselves i say to the members here look at these items carefully we have prepared them in all sincerity we as an institution cannot go on year after year spending more money then we take in in this fiscal year which will close in less than a week we will have probably gone into debt roughly 90 billion in the last 5 years we have added to our national debt over 300 billion notwithstanding the election of november 1980 the spending of the congress of the united states is today out of control the members of this institution do not have the discipline at least as they have exhibited it up to now to match the outgo with the income i think the constructive thing for us to do is to demonstrate with a work product of this type that we can cut spending we can cut our bureaucracy we can cut out waste fraud and abuse i think it is reasonable to undertake this effort in a bipartisan way and try to bring some fiscal sanity into the affairs of this nation"]]}
