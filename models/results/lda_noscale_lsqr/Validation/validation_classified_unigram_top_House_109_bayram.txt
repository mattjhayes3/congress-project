missions in response to katrina these pilots led an aviation disaster response second only to that of the unitedstates military but providing a coordinated aviation response during national

each year volunteer pilots transport hundreds of people with lifethreatening illnesses thousands of miles in order to receive specialized medical attention as well as transporting patients in remote locations who would otherwise be unable to receive care yet despite the importance of their mission these organizations have been left out of the volunteer protection act in its current form this

for needy families seeking specialized medical attention it is important to note that i have worked closely with congressman scott to ensure that this legislation does not shield pilots from liability

tn where last night over 2 000 people showed up at the bradley central high school football arena to honor a great american hero i spoke with sergeant weirs mother and father 2 days ago lynn and jackie weir and it is just extraordinary to me that there are families in this country that love freedom so much love our country so much that even in the most grief and sadness they could ever imagine or experience a hundred percent believe in the mission the service the sacrifice of their own son to defend liberty for our nation lynn weir told me that if he would have tried and he didnt to keep his son from going he could not have kept his son from going he said david weir from the time he was a little boy wanted to serve his country in uniform he was a member of the 101st airborne this was his career this was his way of life he leaves a wife behind alison a little 18monthold son gavin who does not understand what has happened but everyone else knows very clearly what has happened a great american patriot died doing what he wanted to do which was to stand in harms way on behalf of our civilian population as the greatest generation did as other generations have been called to at a time when there is a very real and imminent threat to our way of life called the islamic jihadists and sergeant weir goes to heaven leaves this earth as others have in the most sacrificial way

behind a desk because that was not what he was trained to do that was not what he volunteered to do that was not what he was prepared to do he did what he went there to do and it cost him his life and

a civil war i want to tell you firsthand it is more about islamic jihadists crossing over the borders they continue to attempt to disrupt a young emerging democracy the insurgents are capitalizing on the inexperience of this government and directly causing the sectarian violence and socalled fueling the fire they get more and more strength and resolve when they hear the discourse in our country they know it is only a matter of time before we give up because we perceive the war in iraq is too difficult we all know anything worthwhile is not easy freedom is not free the iraqis are trying to make itwork if we retreat the terrorists win they win now and they win in the future when they have a safe haven to plan train and operate and attack us again it is our choice we are either going to support our efforts to win the global war on terror or we are going to support those that want to retreat inside our borders and wait for the next attack we found out on 9 11 if we retreat they attack

say otherwise are sympathizing with the enemy that is from lieutenant colonel brett hale to me on the ground in iraq what a patriot as he says the word is not getting out in this country in a fair way

it ought to be obvious regardless of what the religion is or how many there are or what is politically correct fanaticism does lead to holy wars and the crusades and we dont want that we want the

go to the united nations and say we cant appease other countries we have to stand behind security for all and freedom for people and liberty everywhere we are all amazed in this country that from our own hemisphere to the south the president of venezuela comes to our country and says this hugo chavez is his name in this country we call each other out of respect even the people who just spoke whom i couldnt disagree with more the people who just spoke are all talking politics they are all interested in the next election not frankly the future of our country and preserving liberty and standing up and meeting the challenge of this generation it is all for them about 47 days from now in an election instead of i believe in my gut standing up and protecting our country but despite that because we are decent reasonable we call them honorable we call each other honorable regardless of whether we agree or not i have got to tell you what the president of venezuela did in this country yesterday was dishonorable it dishonored his nation it dishonors the people of his nation it dishonors everyone south of here in our hemisphere because what it does is it causes people in this country not to trust or even like people who come into this country and say what president hugo chavez said yesterday he said this the devil was here yesterday it still smells of sulfur around here he added he said the president of the united states the gentleman to whom i refer as the devil came here talking as if he owned the world truly as the owner of the world i think we could call a psychiatrist to analyze

criticism of president bush it should be restricted to americans whether they voted for him or not i just want to make it abundantly clear to hugo chavez or any other president do not come to the united states and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that americans do not feel offended when you offend our commander in chief thank you charlie rangel for being an honorable democrat who stands united at this time of war hugo chavez is a troublemaker in a big way he wants to work with iranian president ahmadinejad i watched his interview last night on anderson cooper and he calmly looked anderson cooper in the eyes and he gave a very warped view of history not even willing to acknowledge that the holocaust took place completely in denial you would have to wonder where in the world he gets his facts or his view of the world this is a troubling time in american history i say to young people everywhere i go the days ahead will be very very difficult we need to be honest with them about this but the character of this great nation was born out of the sacrifices the courage and the willingness to face these challenges of our grandparents and our greatgrand7 parents the greatest generation they are the standard for stepping up to meeting global challenges and they gave us our character we didnt get our character by the big buildings or wall street or wealth or even military power we got it by sacrifice and dedication and commitment and family and they are the standard they didnt cower or retreat from these challenges they stood up they faced them head on they showed us what it took to preserve freedom and extend it from one generation to the next and we must do the same thing we must come together as a nation i hate it that we are in the middle of this political campaign while we are at war because it is not good for us to say the things we say even on the floor of this house it is not

bill my colleagues are aware of the fact it would not allow someone to sue a fast food manuficturer because they have gorged themselves with a multiple number of big macs or any other kind of fast food or sometimes what we refer to as junk food it is not the fault of the food industry i used a little analogy when i was talking about this on the floor yesterday in discussing the rule of my belt which is a size 36 that is i hate to admit the size of my waist but if i wanted really out of blind pride to suggest that i had a 24inch waist and i cinched that belt down a couple of notches in doing so i put pressure compression on something referred to as the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve it would result in a condition of numbness and lack of feeling on the anterior thigh then should i go out and sue the belt company because they are at fault because i misused a product this is what this bill of course is all about a commonsense type bill parenthetically i also want to mention the gentleman from florida the author of the bill our good friend and colleague is actually in the hospital now and recovering hopefully from a fairly minor condition but we want to pay tribute to him i kno he is proud that we passed this bill this week the comment that i wanted to make is this issue of personal responsibility and parents should have that personal responsibility obviously in the way they conduct themselves in regard to how they eat and a healthy diet and exercise but even more importantly is the responsibility that they have to give a good example and instructioi to their children i think it is probably the worst form of child abuse to let these youngsters that at a very early age overeat and become obese you have talked about the issue of poor mental image selfimage and of course i also see you talked about hollywood and of course this issue of there is no such thing as mental illness i think probably they might predominate in some of those diseases which we categorize as mental illness but quite honestly when a child goes to school and there is this emphasis on thinness and you see these youngsters wearing these britney spears jeans and that sort of thing a child even a little bit overweight and certainly one that is significantly obese of course they are going to have a poor image of themselves they are going to withdraw and they are going to become shy it is very likely they are going to be picked on how in the world can they grow and develop with a healthy selfimage no wonder they end up needing to be counseled and treated by the gentleman from pennsylvania and other mental health care specialists yes unfortunately some even go on to harm themselves and possibly even commit suicide so i guess the most important thing that i would want to say as a physician member is that we need to prevent this we need to make sure that parents get the message that they have an obligation not just to take care of themselves but first and foremost to take care of these precious children that they bring into the world it is their responsibility to make sure that they are from the very beginning when they start eating at the table to make sure that they are healthy and stay healthy so you do not have to have them ending up in your office treating them for not only mental illness but also the many complications of obesity you mentioned them you mentioned diabetes high blood pressure so many things and talk about the cost to this health care system of ours we always talk about waste fraud and abuse in the medicare and the medicaid programs and wanting to eliminate that and we are very diligent and will continue to be so but this is almost a nobrainer it is like we heard former speaker newt gingrich say to a group of us

maintain its upper hand in pursuing its goals of a successful doha round and also exercising leadership in the global trading system i recently led a bipartisan group of my colleagues to brazil to participate in a study trip to help strengthen the bilateral relationship between our two countries during our time there we met with top brazilian negotiators to discuss key trade issues that we expect will be addressed next week in hong kong at our meetings my colleagues and i drove one critical message and that is our governments unwavering commitment to the utilization and protection of our trade remedy laws there is no doubt the unitedstates employers rely on these laws which serve as a fundamental line of defense an opportunity to police our markets against unfair trade and to preserve domestic industries that otherwise would be at risk there is no question that it is the responsibility of congress and the administration to ensure that our firms have the proper tools to fight illegally traded goods and services while we are committed to opening our markets and have done so historically reducing tradedistorting subsidies and eliminating nontariff barriers to trade we are not willing to give up appropriate tools that we have to police our market for illegally traded imports to reinforce this i introduced a resolution h res 577 calling on unitedstates negotiators to stand firm in the face of international pressure and uphold our trade remedy laws during the wtos doha development agenda round many in the doha round particularly the socalled friends of antidumping negotiations have targeted unitedstates antidumping and countervailing duty measures as distortions to trade they claim they are antifree trade and yet the fact remains that our participation in a free trading system is contingent on our ability to have access to these remedies these laws as i said are the last line of defense and eliminating or weakening them is not a solution to making sure that they work appropriately nor is in this political climate in congress weakening or watering down the ability of the unitedstates to utilize its appropriate trade remedy laws in any way a viable position the time has come for congress to draw a line in the sand and take a much tougher stance with our trading partners to ensure that they fully abide by the rulesbased global trading system we will not stand by and let other countries try to use negotiations to undermine the intent of our domestic trade remedy laws america will no longer tolerate unfair trading practices at the expense of our workers our trade laws have a fundamental purpose and are used only when others break the rules congress will not allow this last line of defense to be compromised in any way and our negotiators need to recognize that my resolution will make very clear what our position is and in the process fend off any attempts to derail our trade laws and put the house on record opposing any multilateral agreement that will weaken these important unitedstates trade protections senators craig and rockefeller have introduced a similar resolution which was included in the senates tax reconciliation bill

colleagues to lend their support to our resolution and join me in working to ensure that the craigrockefeller initiative is included in congress tax reconciliation package as we move to a final package and as we move closer to the trade talks in hong kong which we hope will be successful we must carefully monitor the progress of the doha round and specifically the rules negotiations to ensure that we do not resign ourselves to agreements that would in any other way impede american producers from policing the domestic market this is a fundamental issue for a country that recognizes that our future is in engaging in the international trading system but also that we need to be prepared to reflect back and at least provide the fundamental guarantee to american companies and

so much that even in the most grief and sadness they could ever imagine or experience a hundred percent believe in the mission the service the sacrifice of their own son to defend liberty for our nation lynn weir told me that if he would have tried and he didnt to keep his son from going he could not have kept his son from going he said david weir from the time he was a little boy wanted to

course your specialty in talking about mental illness and as it relates also to childhood obesity and i could not help but think as i was listening to your discussion and as you know this week we just passed h r 554 h r 554 is the personal responsibility in food consumption act of 2005 this is a bill my colleagues are aware of the fact it would not allow someone to sue a fast food manuficturer because they have gorged themselves with a multiple number of big macs or any other kind of fast food or sometimes what we refer to as junk food it is not the fault of the food industry i used a little analogy when i was talking about this on the floor yesterday in discussing the rule of my belt which is a size 36 that is i hate to admit the size of my waist but if i wanted really out of blind pride to suggest that i had a 24inch waist and i cinched that belt down a couple of notches in doing so i put pressure compression on something referred to as the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve it would result in a condition of numbness and lack of feeling on the anterior thigh then should i go out and sue the belt company because they are at fault because i misused a product this is what this bill of course is all about a commonsense type bill parenthetically i also want to mention the gentleman from florida the author of the bill our good friend and colleague is actually in the hospital now and recovering hopefully from a fairly minor condition but we want to pay tribute to him i kno he is proud that we passed this bill this week the comment that i wanted to make is this issue of personal responsibility and parents should have that personal responsibility obviously in the way they conduct themselves in regard to how they eat and a healthy diet and exercise but even more importantly is the responsibility that they have to give a good example and instructioi to their children i think it is probably the worst form of child abuse to let these youngsters that at a very early age overeat and become obese you have talked about the issue of poor mental image selfimage and of course i also see you talked about hollywood and of course this issue of there is no such thing as mental illness i think probably they might predominate in some of those diseases which we categorize as mental illness but quite honestly when a child goes to school and there is this emphasis on thinness and you see these youngsters wearing these britney spears jeans and that sort of thing a child even a little bit overweight and certainly one that is significantly obese of course they are going to have a poor image of themselves they are going to withdraw and they are going to become shy it is very likely they are going to be picked on how in the world can they grow and develop with a healthy selfimage no wonder they end up needing to be counseled and treated by the gentleman from pennsylvania and other mental health care specialists yes unfortunately some even go on to harm themselves and possibly even commit suicide so i guess the most important thing that i would want to say as a physician member is that we need to prevent this we need to make sure that parents get the message that they have an obligation not just to take care of themselves but first and foremost to take care of these precious children that they bring into the world it is their responsibility to make sure that they are from the very beginning when they start eating at the table to make sure that they are healthy and stay healthy so you do not have to have them ending up in your office treating them for not only mental illness but also the many complications of obesity you mentioned them you mentioned diabetes high blood pressure so many things and talk about the cost to this health care system of ours we always talk about waste fraud and abuse in the medicare and the medicaid programs and wanting to eliminate that and we are very diligent and will continue to be so but this is almost a nobrainer it is like we heard former speaker newt gingrich say to a group of us earlier today and the gentleman from pennsylvania was a part of that as we had himcome to speak to members of the house we are not talking about lowhanging fruit here in regard to saving money and saving lives we are talking about fruit that is lying on the ground sitting there rotting waiting for
