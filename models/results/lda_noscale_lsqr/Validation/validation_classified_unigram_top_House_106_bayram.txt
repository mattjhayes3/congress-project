over a year of effort on the part of 12 scientific experts and four representatives from the lay diabetes community support was provided by dozens of other individuals both from within the national institutes of health and from outside the nih the working group was established by congress as part of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations act and based on legislation i introduced in the last session of congress it requested that nih establish the group to develop a comprehensive plan for nihfunded diabetes research dr ronald kahn is an outstanding physician and scientist he was selected the chairman of the group he has spent literally thousands of hours meeting and talking with countless individuals to establish a consensus on the direction of diabetes research the report has exceeded all expectations it clearly details the magnitude of the disease both on the individual and on our society on an individual level diabetes affects virtually every tissue of the body with severe damage since 1980 the ageadjusted death rate due to diabetes has increased by 30 percent while the death rate has fallen for other common diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke diabetes affects about 16 million americans with 800 000 new cases diagnosed each year the societal impact is likewise staggering one in four medicare dollars are spent to treat people with diabetes and over one in 10 health care dollars spent are spent for diabetes in economic terms the cost to society is over 105 billion each year the report identifies five areas of extraordinary research opportunities for making progress in understanding and treating and ultimately preventing and curing diabetes these five areas are the genetics of diabetes and its complications autoimmunity and the beta cell cell signaling and cell regulation obesity and clinical trials and research within each area specific research recommendations are made and in all areas rapid advancements are anticipated finally conquering diabetes the name of this report presents an analysis of current spending and estimates programbyprogram of the cost of implementing each opportunity current spending the group reports is far short of what is required to make progress on this complex and difficult problem they calculate that an increase of 384 million in fiscal year 2000 rising to 1 166 billion in fiscal year 2004 is quote required to have a robust and effective diabetes research effort one which will reduce the rising burden created by this debilitating disease the release of the report has generated extraordinary interest among the scientific community some argue that advances in research must be present to generate an increased nih portfolio while others argue that the presence of research dollars will generate advances as in the case of aids by either standard the time to establish a national commitment to diabetes research is now congress must seize upon the momentum in diabetes research and fully enact the diabetes research working group report recommendations it will take a commitment of 827 million in the next fiscal year the scientific community has united to develop a concrete plan and now it is up to the congress to unite to make this plan a reality i must conclude by saying that this is a very important initiative for our country i know it is going to be a difficult year economically for the appropriations subcommittee that has to deal with this issue but i must say it is in the nations best interest it is in the interest of scientific research and the diabetic and all the complications that come from diabetes that the congress step up and say 827 million is the number i urge my colleagues to support this initiative in the house"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "3 5 million forms containing errors incorrect line references to the irs tax form were printed 100 000 of them were distributed had to be recalled the other ones all had to be destroyed a cost of 720 000 dead and loving it the department of education improperly discharged almost 77 million in student loans for borrowers who claimed to be either permanently disabled or deceased this was a double good news for these people the good news number one is that their loans were forgiven because they were disabled or dead the second bit of good news is they were neither disabled nor dead but the education department had identified them as such and had forgiven their loans most recently a theft ring and this is what happens when you do not have proper controls they had a purchasing agent within the department of education who could order materials certify that they came in certify that they should be paid for and certify that other individuals independent contractors should receive overtime they ordered over 330 000 of electronic equipment authorized the payment the 330 000 of equipment was shipped around to various employees and friends homes around the nations capital this was all done through the phone guy what was in it for the phone guy the phone guy got 660 000 of overtime that he had not worked more recently we had a hearing on this last week another theft ring impact aid funds this is dollars that we send to needy school districts or districts that have a lot of federal facilities in them in this case two school districts in south dakota actually i believe on indian reservations the department of education wired them the money found out a couple of days later because a local car dealer had somebody coming in and wanted to buy a corvette came in and were ready to pay cash or a cashiers check to pay for the corvette the dealership did a credit check on this individual and found out that it did not check out they called the fbi they found out that this group had bought a lincoln navigator a cadillac escalade and they were looking at buying a corvette they also bought a home 135 000 so somebody was checking this to see where did this money come from somebody had gone into the computer systems at the department of ed and this is one of their other problems they do not have computer security and had changed the routing so instead of sending this money to an account into the school districts in south dakota the money went into these individuals accounts in washington to the tune of 1 9 million"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "a couple of days ago i was moved by an article that i read about an individual by the name of leonard peltier mr peltier is currently in the penitentiary federal penitentiary for the assassination of two fbi agents he has been in prison for 25 years i need to be fair to all of my colleagues here and give you some disclosures first of all i used to be a police officer as a result of being a police officer over the years and especially during the time of my tenure as a police officer i developed a very close relationship with agents of the federal bu reau of investigation over the years i have also developed a great deal of respect for the federal bureau of investigation but i must also tell my colleagues that over these years i have also had an opportunity to carefully scrutinize the federal bureau of investigation because you see i think it is a very important agency for our country but i think the integrity of the agency is also very very important in the past i have been very critical of the federal bureau of investigation when they messed up i can give you an excellent example ruby ridge the agents involved at ruby ridge in my opinion should have been immediately terminated what happened at ruby ridge i will not repeat this evening but i will tell you that the command officer from the federal bureau of investigation was not terminated in fact the command officer was put on a paid leave of absence for 1 or 2 years and retired and received in my opinion no punishment at all i am also looking with a very careful eye at the federal bureau of investigations role at the waco texas goofup that too is a very tragic situation in the history of our country and i think unfortunately there will be revealed within the report about the incident at waco texas that the federal bureau of investigation misstated their role understated their contribution so to speak or their involveient in the situation at waco texas so i am not necessarily in lockstep with the federal bureau of investigation but i can tell you when i look at all of the law enforcement agencies i have seen over the years and as a former law enforcement officer i have had the opportunity to be involved with many of them at the very highest when you look at the picture as an average the federal bureau of investigation comes out at the very top and i think it isi incumbent colleagues of every one of us when we see an attack launched against the federal bureau of investigation that is launched without justification or when we see an action being taken against the federal bureau of investigation without justification we have a commitment to step forward and say something about it as i mentioned at the beginning of my comments i saw an article the other day about this individual this gentlemans name is leonard peltier i saw today in fact an article in the usa today the article is indians fbi face off in washington first of all i am not sure why the author of the usa today article uses the word indians in a broad or general descriptive form in imy particular district which is the third congressional district of the state of colorado we have the indian tribal lands and i have yet to hear from any of the leaders of those indian tribes of which i work with very closely on projects such as the animus laplata the kind of appeal that may be suggested by all indians as a result of this particular article it is my opinion that the native american involvement in this case is limited and it is also my opinionthat if you sit down with the average native american in this country and you look at the facts of this case that there will be very few native americans who would step forward and say that this particular convict is a political prisoner i think this is a stage being set by the defense attorneys for this convict actually using the word convict is somewhat gentle he is not a convict he is a murderer and he is a coldblooded murderer he killed two fbi agents in cold blood now 25 years ago as one defense attorney would suggest is something that enough time has passed by that perhaps he has served his time for this violent and horrible crime i will quote exactly from the usa today peltier that is the convict the murderer that i am talking about has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in attorney carl nadler says can you believe this let me repeat what this defense attorney says peltier has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in prison what he is suggesting is that 25 years is enough time for somebody to serve that goes out and in cold blood assassinates two officers of the federal bureau of investigation well r stand here tonight colleagues in deep disagreement with this defense attorney and i urge that all of my colleagues on the floor take time to review what is going on in the month of november in regard to this case now why have i suggested the month of november well apparently this murderers defense team has put together a little political show and tell and they call november the month of publicity or the month to get reprieve for this convicted murderer what i mean by that it is this month that they are submitting papers to the president of the united states request ing that clemency be granted to leonard peltier a convicted murderer a couple of days ago i read an open letter this open letter is a joint letter authored by the federal bureau of investigation agents association located in new rochelle new york and the society of former special agents of the federal bureau of investigation located in quantico virginia the above organizations which are professional nongovernmental associations rep resent over 20 000 active duty and former fbi agents i was so moved by this letter that i ask my colleagues to follow me closely this evening as i read verbatim that open letter to the american people as many of you know i do not often read from notes when i speak from this podium but i am going to be very careful this evening that i read this letter verbatim because i think it is important that every one of us in this room have a clear understahding of the facts of this case before peltiers defense attorney arrives here in washington d c sets up this political show and tell and tries to convince through propaganda that for some reason this convicted murderer deserves clemency from the president of the united states we should not take this lightly we had a very difficult situation about 1 month ago when clemency was given to the puerto rican terrorists as i pointed out from this house floor you can look right up in the roof of this fine room and you can see the bullet hole or i could walk over here to this desk drawer and show you the bullet holes through that desk from the puerto rican terrorists who entered this floor many years ago firing weapons well this case is somewhat similar except in this case we know we have the person who conducted two savage cold blooded murders on these fbi agents let me begin the letter june 26 1975 was a hot dusty thursday on the pine ridge indian reservation in southwestern south dakota when two fbi agents arrived from their office in rapid city it was about noon when special agents ronald a williams age 27 and jack r coler age 28 pulled into the jumping bull compound area of the remote reservation seeking to arrest a young man in connection with the recent abduction and assault of two young ranchers observing their suspect peltiers vehicle the agents pursied it unknown to special agent coler and special agent williams one of the three men in the vehicle was leonard peltier a violent man with a violent past he was a fugitive wanted for attempted murder of an off duty milwaukee police officer knowing that the two vehicles pursuing him were occupied by fbi agents and believing they were seeking t arresthim on that attempted murder case peltier and his associates abruptly stopped their vehicle and began firing rifles at the agents surprised by the sudden violence outmanned outgunned and at an extreme tactical disadvantage coler and williams were both wounded and defenseless within minutes coler sustained a severe wound the force of the bullet nearly tearing his right arm off williams wounded in the left shoulder and the right foot removed his shirt during the hail of incoming rifle fire and fashioned a tourniquet around the arm ofcoler who had by then fallen unconscious agents coler and williams were then at the mercy of leonard peltier and his associates but there was to be no mercy for these fine young law enforcement officers not satisfied with the terrible injuries that they had inflicted peltier and the two other men walked down the hill towards the ambushed agents three shots were fired from peltiers rifle williams kneeling and apparently surrendering was shot in the face directly through his out extended shielding handled he died instantly coler who was still unconscious was shot twice in the head at closerange he died instantly from those shots the crime scene examination testified to the brutality of the ambush coler and williams had little chance to defend themselves they had fired only five shots in contrast over 125 bullet holes were found in into the car following the murder peltier fled the reservation in november 1975 an oregon state trooper stopped a recreational vehicle in which peltier was hiding peltier fired at the trooper and escaped coler the fbi agent who had been assassinated earlier on his revolver which was stolen when he was murdered was found in a paper bag under the front seat of the recreational vehicle peltiers thumb print was on that bag when arrested later in canada by the royal canadian mounted police peltier remarked that had he known the royal canadian mounted police officers were there to arrest him he would have blown them out of their shoes these are not the comments of an innocent man and they pottray the true character and the violent nature of leonard peltier in april 1977 a jury convicted peltier of themurders of those two fbi agents coler and williams a judge sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences while incarcerated in the lompoc california federal prison and with outside assistance peltier shot his way out of jail using a smuggled rifle to make his escape several days later after assaulting a rancher and stealing a pick up peltier was captured he was tried and convicted of escape and ofbeing a felon in possession of a firearm peltier has since appealed his various convictions numerous times each time the federal courts have upheld earlier legal decisions the united states supreme court has twice denied peltier review without comment the record is clear there were no new facts there are no new facts the old facts have not changed and peltier is guilty as charged i several times on national television peltier has admitted to firing at the two agents in his most recent public interview peltier has even reluctantly conceded what he had previously denied that he had in fact gone down to where the agents were executed still he openly states that he feels no guilt no remorse nor even any regret for the murders leonard peltier has lived a life of crime he has earned and deserves a lifetime of incarceration leonard peltier is a murderer without compassion or feeling towards his fellow man in turn he deserves no compassion mr president there is no justification for relieving leonard peltier from his punishment our judicial system has spoken in this case again again and again leonard peltier is a vicioug violent and cowardly criminal that hides behind legitimate native american issues leonard peltier was never a leader in the native american community he is simply a brute thug and murderer with no respect no regard for human life our citizens on and off the reservations must be protected from predators like peltier mr president since leonard peltier could not fool the federal courts he is now trying to fool you to fool the public he is shading and hiding the facts and playing on sympathy he and his advocates want to confuse the fact of his guilt with matters completely extraneous to that fact do not let him get away with it mr president sympathy is appropriate only for dead heroes and surviving families do not let their sacrifice be forgotten that was somewhat of a lengthy letter but as you can tell it is a subject that should be dear to every one of our hearts in this room to the heart of every american out there that believes in law and justice to every law enforcement family out there that currently has someone in law enfordement or has had a member of their family in law enforcement if we let if we let this kind of violent assassin out of prison after serving only 24 years it will in my opinion be a crippling blow to the message that we need to send to the law enforcement in this country that message really is fairly simple that is that you work as a law enforcement officer to provide as your duty peace and justice in our system and that when eace and justice are attacked in our system our system has a price it has a consequence it has a punishment it is the only way we can uphold the integrity of our system of law enforcement is to have a zero tolerance or a limited tolerance of any type of direct attack against our system of peace and justice the assassination of two federal bureau of investigation agents no matter how many years ago is a direct attack against the legal and justice process in this country i urge all my colleagues to join with me in attempting to be persuasive with the president of the united states and the american public in saying how important it is that this politicalcharade being put on by the defense attorneys for this convicted assassin that this kind of show be stopped that this kind of show be denied their goal their goal of course is to let this convicted assassin walk the streets of america again do not let him hide under the shield of being a native american that is a disgrace to the native americans do not pull native americans down to the level of this convicted killer do not affiliate this convicted killer with the native americans in this country that is an insult in my opinion if we do do not forget the facts of the case just so that i can remind the members let me go through the facts again in a little briefer form than the letter two fbi agents were assassinated they attempted to pursue a vehicle which contained this suspect at the time suspect now a convicted killer leonard peltier they were wounded they were disarmed by the wounds that they had in othef words they could not fight back they didnt have any weapons left to fight back with they were not physically capable one the fbi agents was unconscious the other fbi agent was rendering first aid to the unconscious fbi agent this convicted killer who by the way was a fugitive from justice for the attempted assassination of an offduty police officer in milwaukee walked up to these two fbi agents and executed them in cold blood he was later stopped in a recreational vehicle in that vehicle they found one of the deceased agents pistols in a paper bag that bag had evidence peltiers fingerprints on it peltier was captured in canada he was convicted of two counts of murder for these fbi agents he escaped from the federal prison do not let people tell us this guy is a nonviolent guy he was in federal prison and he shot his way out of federal prison think of the last time since the john dillinger days or bonnie and clyde and so on that somebody shot their way out of the federal prison that is who this individual is now today now today he is in front of the american people in front of the president of the united states asking for mercy look 25 years ago may seem like a long time to some but it has been a real long time for the families of those young fbi agents that were assassinated in cold blood in conclusion on this particular issue let me ask for members support in standing up strong for the law enforcement community of the country in standing up strong for the families and the agents and professionals of the federal bureau of investigation in standing up strong for the concept of peace and justice within the boundaries of our country let us all have our voice heard that in the united states of america if you assassinate a police officer or just as soon two federal bureau of investigation officers you will pay a price and we will stick with the punishment that we deal out we are not a bunch of patsies do not come back to us and think you are going to get a free walk 25 years later after that kind of action if we fail to do this if we fail to do this we are sending the wrong message out there and we are crippling justice and peace in our country i would like to do an update on a couple of other subjects this evening while i have the opportunity to visit with the members as members will recall about 2 or 3 weeks ago maybe a month ago there is a museum in new york city called the brooklyn art museum the brooklyn art museum it was discovered with taxpayer dollars with taxpayer dollars was sponsoring an art exhibit that depicted among other things a portrait of the virgin mary which is one of the holiest symbols of the catholic religion throughout the world and of christianity throughout the world this art museum was allowingin this art exhibit with taxpayer dollars this portrait of the virgin mary with elephant dung as they say crap as i say thrown all over the portrait can members imagine that how long do members think that type of art exhibit would have been tolerated or should have been tolerated in this country at taxpayer dollars if it was an exhibit of martin luther king for example or if it were an exhibit of an outstanding jewish rabbi for example or if it were an exhibit of some other outstanding leader that meant so much to a religious organization anywhere in this world they would not put up with that but for some reason there seems to be some justification out there by some people that an attack on christianity should be separated from an attack say on martin luther king or an attack on the image of a jewish rabbi and so on and so forth what happened is that the mayor of new york city mayor rudy giuliani i think had some guts he stood up and he said we are drawing the line that has gone too far there is a strong freedom of expression in this country there is a first amendment in this country but there is a balance that we have in this country just the same as under the freedom of speech we do not allow individuals to go into a theater and yell fire fire fire we do not allow that that is not a violation of your first amendment rights but we do not allow you to go into a theater and do that we draw a line this thing is not carte blanche this first amendment to do anything that you feel like doing especially when you do it with taxpayer dollars the mayor came under heavy criticism by the very elite that were dealing with the brooklyn art museum the board of directors who i think were acting very pompous in somehow defending this disgraceful work of art not a work of art that is just controversial that brings up lots of discussion but a work of art that hit at the very integrity of a large religious group throughout the world that was the maximum type of insult that you could throw at that particular religion and did it with ainerican taxpayer dollars why do i keep bringing up the fact of american taxpayer dollars because therein lies the distinction as to whether or not this is an issue under the first amendment of our constitution under our constitution frankly had the united states taxpayer dollars not been used to fund this portrait of the virgin mary of which dung was thrown all over it had taxpayer dollars not been used i am afraid to say that this would have been probably protected or would have been protected underthe first amendment we can tolerate that it is horrible and i cannot imagine for example why the first lady hillary clinton stood up for this thing she said however in her comments that while she would not go see it but she certainly stood up for the right to go around and exhibit this with taxpayer dollars iunderstand where some would say it is a first amendment right if there is not taxpayer dollars being used although i can tell the members that the press in this country and the liberal left in this country would not have stood for 2 seconds if it were martin luther king or a jewish rabbi or some other celebrated figure being treated in that fashion but the key here is taxpayer dollars 0 2320 the point here is very clear and i think the citizens of this country i think we need to go out and ask our constituents do the citizens of this country really think it is a justified and constitutionally protected right under the constitution to fund this kind of art with taxpayer dollars or should this type of art be denied the access of taxpayer dollars and allowed to be funded in society with private dollars remember that my objection tonight and the mayor of new york citys objection to this art was not that the art should iot be shown now it is disgraceful do not get me wrong i do not condone this kind of art but there is a constitutionally protected right to show this art without taxpayer dollars that argument has some legitimacy but that was not the debate that is being carried forward here what the mayor said what i said and mr speaker what i think most of our constituents believe is that this kind of art i e the virgin mary with dung splashed all over her with taxpayer dollars has gone over that line you draw a line you have gone over that line do not use taxpayer dollars the brooklyn art museum in new york they could easily fund this through other monies they just want to try and make an issue what they want to do is open that door so that taxpayers in this country will have to pay out of their hardearned dollars will have to use those taxpayer dollars to let the socalled art community especially the elite of the brooklyn art museum fund anything they would like no matter how offensive no matter how derogatory it is that is wrong this art museum knows that it is wrong well there has been a new step a new report to update you on and that is that a federal court judge this week actually came out and said that the art museum has a right to use taxpayer dollars to exhibit this type of art i e the virgin mary with dung thrown all over her in very obviously a disgraceful fashion intended to be as derogatory as possible not only towards christianity but towards one of the most important symbols of christianity i am telling you federal judge you made a mistake you are wrong there is not a constitutionally protected provision that says you can use taxpayer dollars in this country to fund that kind of art why do you not use some common sense why do you have to offend the people of christianity why do you do an allout attack you would not do it with martin luther king and the black community you would not do it in the jewish community with some rabbi of theirs you would not do it with some other type of religious entity or important entity in this country with their leader why are you doing this why do you decide to use taxpayer dollars to offend every christian in the world it is wrong you have got a temporary victory from this federal judge but in the end i think the mayor of new york city one had a lot of guts to do what he did and number two i think he is going to prevail i also think that the general opinion in this country is look that kind of art as violent and as horrible and as disgraceful as it is is protected but not with the use of taxpayer dollars our constituents i do not believe are in any way about to buy the argument that we ought to take the tax dollars out of their paycheck every week and put a percentage of that towards the funding of this kind of art"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "absolutely our

folks are looking forward to the day when they will be unleashed from the federal rules and regulations that hamper their ability to teach children in an effective way we spend billions of dollars here in washington and yet for the billions we spend the actual proportion of federal funds that actually reach a classroom is relatively small somewhere on the order of 7 6 sometimes as high as 9 percent in some needy or poorer school districts but for that small relatively small portion of federal funds that make up an overall classroom budget the strings and the red tape and the requirements and mandates attached to that minority of cash is overpowering there are school districts in my state that have to hire people just to fill out the federal paperwork so that they can get the money this is money that comes to washington the american taxpayers are working hard every day and paying their taxes the money comes here to washington d c the congress then through its formulas and so on divvies up this cash in a variety of ways and then there is this huge bureaucracy not too far from where we are now that then goes to work on this money by the time that cash makes its way back to colorado and back to the state of georgia and every other state in the union there is just a fraction left for the kids that is what our straight as proposal is designed to resolve not to spend more money in washington we do not need to do that we can actually increase the proportion of dollars that make it to a child by cutting all these silly rules and regulations i know there are people over

will be candid and frank with the gentleman and with them and with the american people i frankly care more about ffiy children in public schools and all of the children of my friends and neighbors back in colorado than i do about these people down the street here in the department of education i want the money to get to the kids and to the teachers who know how to teach rather than the bureaucrats who know how to provide paperwork and produce more headaches for communities around the country this straight as proposal it is a big thing there are 760 federal education programs the edflex bill that we passed dealt with i think 9 of them 9 significant ones it was a big step in the right direction to follow up to take the next logical step to show the american people that we are serious about moving authority out of washington and empowering our local communities this straight as proposal is a significant one i might add that we have almost 100 cosponsors now in this congress including on our side of the aisle the republican side every member of that committee is on board every member of our republican leadership is on board it is a bipartisan bill we have democrats who are cosponsors of straight as this is a big initiative and an exciting one and the gentleman is right before i turn it back over to the gentleman to suggest that the education leaders in my state and

commissaries last year even with that government help the millers cannot afford the insurance copayment to have their sons cavities filled i further want to quote an interview with david lewis david lewis is a retired warrant officer and his quote is i think the biggest problem is that they just dont have enough going back to tom jarriel again the reporter for abcs 20 20 and he says retired warrant officer david lewis a hardened combat veteran of 26 years in the marine corps teaches financial planning to thousands of marines a year at camp pendleton david lewis further states at first it really bothered me that they did not have enough pride in themselves and i said quoting david lewis well wait a minute it doesnt have anything to do with pride it probably took more courage for that kid to get food it probably took a lot of courage for that kid to say i cannot take care of my family i need help tom jarriel further states lewis calculated that by total hours junior enlisted troops do not even earn minimum wage i want to read that again lewis calculated that by total work hours junior enlisted troops do not even earn minimum wage that is why i am on the floor today and i have

we have approximately 90 people who have signed this bill i am encouraging our leadership as well as the democratic leadership to please let us not leave here in september or october and not speak to those who are serving our nation those who are willing to die for this country that are on food stamps to me that is unacceptable that to me is what i think america stands for is to help those in uniform who are willing to give their lives for this country what i have before me today is a marine this marine is getting ready to deploy to bosnia we seem to be able to find 9 million to 10 million for bosnia we have already spent 10 billion to 11 billion in yugoslavia yet this cost to pass h r 1055 to get a 500 tax credit for those on food stamps would only cost this government 59 million over 10 years roughly 5 million a year i will be the first to say this will not get them off food stamps but what i will say is that it will say to those in the military who are on food stamps that we in the congress are concerned about the fact that they are on food stamps and they are willing to die for this country i look at the other bills that we pass in the senate and the house and we can find billions of dollars in tax credits for tysons food to study chicken manure and how this might help with energy problems i say let us take care of those first who are willing to take care of america they are our men and women in uniform who are on food stamps i look at this little girl megan is her name she is standing on the feet of her daddy do you know what that serious look that she has she is looking at a camera in his arms he has his daughter brittany i am thinking about megan she does not know this at her age but her daddy might not come back he might not come back he is willing to give his life for this country this marine represents all of our military in both air force navy army and coast guard that are willing to serve this nation i hope that our leadership working together

medicare the presidents budget sets aside 1 3 trillion for social security and earmarks about 345 billion for medicare that is 1 645 trillion over 100 billion less than our budget no matter how we add it up 137 billion is more than 85 billion no matter how we add it up 1 8 trillion is more than 1 645 trillion two plus two does equal four some on the other side who are using projections on the presidents budget will save over 15 years compared to our budget over 10 years that as the saying goes two plus two does equal five no matter how you look at it we are saving more for social security

congress like the postcensus local review give those local officials like they had in 1990 a chance to have a quality check another issue they are opposing and let me tell my colleagues this they are opposing making the census form available in numerous languages and braille they said we are going to put it in five languages besides english and if you know of another language tough you have to call an 800 number and hopefully you will find somebody who can translate and if you are blind you know tough i mean what do you do that is so sad they are opposed to it it is not that difficult to make available forms for those that request it to get these forms i was in miami we had a hearing back in december the gentlewoman from florida has about 150 000 haitians in her district now a lot of them have not learned english yet and how do they fill out a form our colleague the gentleman from california from long beach he has about 50 000 cambodians in his district now how do they fill out a form if an elderly person now somebody would say oh they should not be counted but everybody living in this country gets counted it is required by our united states constitution and here is amazing this is the democratic party that wants to reach out to everybody and they are refusing to publish the seven questions only seven questions in these languages and one of our bills is to put it out in 33 languages plus braille rather than the five languages their argument is well our five languages we get 99 percent of the people well 1 percent of the american people is 2 7 million people and we only missed 1 6 percent of the population last time why are they afraid to do that i mean it is the republicans are out there trying to make it more accessible to have everybody fill out the form and so i mean it is so frustrating that they say we are perfect we do not make mistakes and we are all professionals and you know do not micromanage well do not micromanage they are the ones that spent a billion dollars over the past 7 years on a illegal plan and it was not until january that they you know we got hit in the head they realized yes it was illegal and they said that is the reason we are going to go to two numbers i mean it is an amazing organization to deal with and these other ideas we are proposing it was another one they are opposed to is and this has support from general accounting office and at one time the academy of sciences supported it we get one form in the mail and you know hopefully everybody returns it we get as many as we can returned but if you send the second form as a reminder it will increase response rates by 6 or 7 percent they tried that out when they did what is called a dress rehearsal last year in sacramento and columbia south carolina they will get a 6 or 7 percent improvement on response rate that is about 19 million people that many fewer forms have to be filled out and they are opposed to it they are going to fight it and the president is going to veto it he is going to veto those 33 languages he is going to veto postcensus review i do not understand their logic it is so frustrating i mean even we had one program we debated for probably 45 minutes yesterday in committee it is something called census in the school program it is a good program and i hope when it becomes available that you can go to your schools and promote it especially when you go to the indian schools which we visited when we were in your district it was really kind of neat to see the indian schools there because what the census in school form is is going to be a form that is going to be sent out to the teachers of elementary schools in elementary schools and selected teachers in middle and secondary schools that teach geography i think government math i think three different categories and the idea is they will get a request if they want to participate in the program send back a card and they will get maps and materials and it is a good way to teach a civics lesson and you know they can teach mathematics they can teach geography there are lots of things kids can learn about the census and the constitution on it if the teachers want to so we are going to make it available the census bureau was only going to make it available to 20 percent of the schools and we think it is a good program so we commend them and say we think it should be made available to everybody all the schools they are contracting it out so it is not like extra work for them there is a group called scholastic inc that has got the contract and it is just a matter of sending the letter to all these teachers and if they like it send back a card and they fought us and fought us and fought us yesterday over that issue and they finally agreed to let it go by voice vote and i understand i said are you opposed to 60 percent of the teachers receiving this why are you opposed to the possibility of helping kids we can get members of congress to go to schools in their district to help promote it it is something that is good civics it is good public policy and you know they finally gave in and voice voted it was amazing"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "as members

significant federal barrier to a more competitive electric power industry more than 20 years ago the public utility regulatory policies act purpa was enacted as one of the original components of the carter energy plan convinced that we were running out of natural gas and that the price of oil would soar to 100 per barrel or even more by the year 2000 congress passed purpa to encourage conservation and promote the use of renewable fuels to generate electricity it did this by establishing a special class of power generators known as qualifying facilities ofs and it required utilities to buy all the electricity that these facilities wished to sell at a price determined generally by federal regulators and specifically by state regulators congress sought in drafting purpa to ensure that customers would pay no more for purpa power than they would have to pay for other power it did this by providing in purpa that the maximum price for electricity from qfs would be the cost that the purchase utility would have incurred if it had generated the electricity itself or had purchased it from a source other than the qf unfortunately this has not proven to be the case because govemnment projections of utility avoided costs have been seriously in error one recent study estimates that purpa is costing electricity consumers nearly 8 billion a year in excess power costs since over 60 percent of purpa contracts will not expire until after the year 2010 consumers will continue to pay these excess costs well into the future purpa also stands in the way of a more competitive electric industry by granting special status to some electricity generators but not others purpa encourages the creation of uneconomic projects just to qualify for purpa benefits moreover purpa was premised on utilities continuing to be the exclusive suppliers of electricity to all consumers within their franchise territories in many states today customers have the ability to choose their own electric supplier requiring utilities to purchase new purpa power when they may no longer have retail customers to whom they can resell power makes no sense with 20 years of experience behind us it is clear that purpa has outlived its usefulness my legislation would do three things to reform purpa 1 it would prospectively repeal purpas mandatory purchase obligation on the date of enactment so that there would no longer be any new obligations to purchase this power 2 it would respect the sanctity of existing purpa contracts and 3 it would ensure that purchasing utilities would continue to be permitted to recover the costs of existing purpa contracts as long as these contracts are in effect as i said upon introduction of virtually identical legislation during the last two congresses my only interest in introducing this bill lies in achieving the most efficient and most costeffective means of electric generation for americas consumers while it would prospectively repeal purpa and would ensure that no new purpa contracts would be required it recognizes the legitimate current expectations of qf developers and utility purchasers i believe that it represents a broad based

rate has fallen for other common diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke diabetes affects about 16 million americans with 800 000 new cases diagnosed each year the societal impact is likewise staggering one in four medicare dollars are spent to treat people with diabetes and over one in 10 health care dollars spent are spent for diabetes in economic terms the cost to society is over 105 billion each year the report identifies five areas of extraordinary research opportunities for making progress in understanding and treating and ultimately preventing and curing diabetes these five areas are the genetics of diabetes and its complications autoimmunity and the beta cell cell signaling and cell regulation obesity and clinical trials and research within each area specific research recommendations are made and in all areas rapid advancements are anticipated finally conquering diabetes the name of this report presents an analysis of current spending and estimates programbyprogram of the cost of implementing each opportunity current spending the group reports is far short of what is required to make progress on this complex and difficult problem they calculate that an increase of 384 million in fiscal year 2000 rising to 1 166 billion in fiscal year 2004 is quote required to have a robust and effective diabetes research effort one which will reduce the rising burden created by this debilitating disease the release of the report has generated extraordinary interest among the scientific community some argue that advances in research must be present to generate an increased nih portfolio while others argue that the presence of research dollars will generate advances as in the case of aids by either standard the time to establish a national commitment to diabetes research is now congress must seize upon the momentum in diabetes research and fully enact the diabetes research working group report recommendations it will take a commitment of 827 million in the next fiscal year the scientific community has united to develop a concrete plan and now it is up to the congress to unite to make this plan a reality i must conclude by saying that this is a very important initiative for our country i know it is going to be a difficult year economically for the appropriations subcommittee that has to deal with this issue but i must say it is in the nations best interest it is in the interest of scientific research and the diabetic and all the complications that come from diabetes that the congress step up and say 827 million is the number i urge my colleagues to support this initiative in the house"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "3 5 million forms containing errors incorrect line references to the irs tax form were printed 100 000 of them were distributed had to be recalled the other ones all had to be destroyed a cost of 720 000 dead and loving it the department of education improperly discharged almost 77 million in student loans for borrowers who claimed to be either permanently disabled or deceased this was a double good news for these people the good news number one is that their loans were forgiven because they were disabled or dead the second bit of good news is they were neither disabled nor dead but the education department had identified them as such and had forgiven their loans most recently a theft ring and this is what happens when you do not have proper controls they had a purchasing agent within the department of education who could order materials certify that they came in certify that they should be paid for and certify that other individuals independent contractors should receive overtime they ordered over 330 000 of electronic equipment authorized the payment the 330 000 of equipment was shipped around to various employees and friends homes around the nations capital this was all done through the phone guy what was in it for the phone guy the phone guy got 660 000 of overtime that he had not worked more recently we had a hearing on this last week another theft ring impact aid funds this is dollars that we send to needy school districts or districts that have a lot of federal facilities in them in this case two school districts in south dakota actually i believe on indian reservations the department of education wired them the money found out a couple of days later because a local car dealer had somebody coming in and wanted to buy a corvette came in and were ready to pay cash or a cashiers check to pay for the corvette the dealership did a credit check on this individual and found out that it did not check out they called the fbi they found out that this group had bought a lincoln navigator a cadillac escalade and they were looking at buying a corvette they also bought a home 135 000 so somebody was checking this to see where did this money come from somebody had gone into the computer systems at the department of ed and this is one of their other problems they do not have computer security and had changed the routing so instead of sending this money to an account into the school districts in south dakota the money went into these individuals accounts in washington to the tune of 1 9 million"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a couple of days ago i was moved by an article that i read about an individual by the name of leonard peltier mr peltier is currently in the penitentiary federal penitentiary for the assassination of two fbi agents he has been in prison for 25 years i need to be fair to all of my colleagues here and give you some disclosures first of all i used to be a police officer as a result of being a police officer over the years and especially during the time of my tenure as a police officer i developed a very close relationship with agents of the federal bu reau of investigation over the years i have also developed a great deal of respect for the federal bureau of investigation but i must also tell my colleagues that over these years i have also had an opportunity to carefully scrutinize the federal bureau of investigation because you see i think it is a very important agency for our country but i think the integrity of the agency is also very very important in the past i have been very critical of the federal bureau of investigation when they messed up i can give you an excellent example ruby ridge the agents involved at ruby ridge in my opinion should have been immediately terminated what happened at ruby ridge i will not repeat this evening but i will tell you that the command officer from the federal bureau of investigation was not terminated in fact the command officer was put on a paid leave of absence for 1 or 2 years and retired and received in my opinion no punishment at all i am also looking with a very careful eye at the federal bureau of investigations role at the waco texas goofup that too is a very tragic situation in the history of our country and i think unfortunately there will be revealed within the report about the incident at waco texas that the federal bureau of investigation misstated their role understated their contribution so to speak or their involveient in the situation at waco texas so i am not necessarily in lockstep with the federal bureau of investigation but i can tell you when i look at all of the law enforcement agencies i have seen over the years and as a former law enforcement officer i have had the opportunity to be involved with many of them at the very highest when you look at the picture as an average the federal bureau of investigation comes out at the very top and i think it isi incumbent colleagues of every one of us when we see an attack launched against the federal bureau of investigation that is launched without justification or when we see an action being taken against the federal bureau of investigation without justification we have a commitment to step forward and say something about it as i mentioned at the beginning of my comments i saw an article the other day about this individual this gentlemans name is leonard peltier i saw today in fact an article in the usa today the article is indians fbi face off in washington first of all i am not sure why the author of the usa today article uses the word indians in a broad or general descriptive form in imy particular district which is the third congressional district of the state of colorado we have the indian tribal lands and i have yet to hear from any of the leaders of those indian tribes of which i work with very closely on projects such as the animus laplata the kind of appeal that may be suggested by all indians as a result of this particular article it is my opinion that the native american involvement in this case is limited and it is also my opinionthat if you sit down with the average native american in this country and you look at the facts of this case that there will be very few native americans who would step forward and say that this particular convict is a political prisoner i think this is a stage being set by the defense attorneys for this convict actually using the word convict is somewhat gentle he is not a convict he is a murderer and he is a coldblooded murderer he killed two fbi agents in cold blood now 25 years ago as one defense attorney would suggest is something that enough time has passed by that perhaps he has served his time for this violent and horrible crime i will quote exactly from the usa today peltier that is the convict the murderer that i am talking about has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in attorney carl nadler says can you believe this let me repeat what this defense attorney says peltier has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in prison what he is suggesting is that 25 years is enough time for somebody to serve that goes out and in cold blood assassinates two officers of the federal bureau of investigation well r stand here tonight colleagues in deep disagreement with this defense attorney and i urge that all of my colleagues on the floor take time to review what is going on in the month of november in regard to this case now why have i suggested the month of november well apparently this murderers defense team has put together a little political show and tell and they call november the month of publicity or the month to get reprieve for this convicted murderer what i mean by that it is this month that they are submitting papers to the president of the united states request ing that clemency be granted to leonard peltier a convicted murderer a couple of days ago i read an open letter this open letter is a joint letter authored by the federal bureau of investigation agents association located in new rochelle new york and the society of former special agents of the federal bureau of investigation located in quantico virginia the above organizations which are professional nongovernmental associations rep resent over 20 000 active duty and former fbi agents i was so moved by this letter that i ask my colleagues to follow me closely this evening as i read verbatim that open letter to the american people as many of you know i do not often read from notes when i speak from this podium but i am going to be very careful this evening that i read this letter verbatim because i think it is important that every one of us in this room have a clear understahding of the facts of this case before peltiers defense attorney arrives here in washington d c sets up this political show and tell and tries to convince through propaganda that for some reason this convicted murderer deserves clemency from the president of the united states we should not take this lightly we had a very difficult situation about 1 month ago when clemency was given to the puerto rican terrorists as i pointed out from this house floor you can look right up in the roof of this fine room and you can see the bullet hole or i could walk over here to this desk drawer and show you the bullet holes through that desk from the puerto rican terrorists who entered this floor many years ago firing weapons well this case is somewhat similar except in this case we know we have the person who conducted two savage cold blooded murders on these fbi agents let me begin the letter june 26 1975 was a hot dusty thursday on the pine ridge indian reservation in southwestern south dakota when two fbi agents arrived from their office in rapid city it was about noon when special agents ronald a williams age 27 and jack r coler age 28 pulled into the jumping bull compound area of the remote reservation seeking to arrest a young man in connection with the recent abduction and assault of two young ranchers observing their suspect peltiers vehicle the agents pursied it unknown to special agent coler and special agent williams one of the three men in the vehicle was leonard peltier a violent man with a violent past he was a fugitive wanted for attempted murder of an off duty milwaukee police officer knowing that the two vehicles pursuing him were occupied by fbi agents and believing they were seeking t arresthim on that attempted murder case peltier and his associates abruptly stopped their vehicle and began firing rifles at the agents surprised by the sudden violence outmanned outgunned and at an extreme tactical disadvantage coler and williams were both wounded and defenseless within minutes coler sustained a severe wound the force of the bullet nearly tearing his right arm off williams wounded in the left shoulder and the right foot removed his shirt during the hail of incoming rifle fire and fashioned a tourniquet around the arm ofcoler who had by then fallen unconscious agents coler and williams were then at the mercy of leonard peltier and his associates but there was to be no mercy for these fine young law enforcement officers not satisfied with the terrible injuries that they had inflicted peltier and the two other men walked down the hill towards the ambushed agents three shots were fired from peltiers rifle williams kneeling and apparently surrendering was shot in the face directly through his out extended shielding handled he died instantly coler who was still unconscious was shot twice in the head at closerange he died instantly from those shots the crime scene examination testified to the brutality of the ambush coler and williams had little chance to defend themselves they had fired only five shots in contrast over 125 bullet holes were found in into the car following the murder peltier fled the reservation in november 1975 an oregon state trooper stopped a recreational vehicle in which peltier was hiding peltier fired at the trooper and escaped coler the fbi agent who had been assassinated earlier on his revolver which was stolen when he was murdered was found in a paper bag under the front seat of the recreational vehicle peltiers thumb print was on that bag when arrested later in canada by the royal canadian mounted police peltier remarked that had he known the royal canadian mounted police officers were there to arrest him he would have blown them out of their shoes these are not the comments of an innocent man and they pottray the true character and the violent nature of leonard peltier in april 1977 a jury convicted peltier of themurders of those two fbi agents coler and williams a judge sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences while incarcerated in the lompoc california federal prison and with outside assistance peltier shot his way out of jail using a smuggled rifle to make his escape several days later after assaulting a rancher and stealing a pick up peltier was captured he was tried and convicted of escape and ofbeing a felon in possession of a firearm peltier has since appealed his various convictions numerous times each time the federal courts have upheld earlier legal decisions the united states supreme court has twice denied peltier review without comment the record is clear there were no new facts there are no new facts the old facts have not changed and peltier is guilty as charged i several times on national television peltier has admitted to firing at the two agents in his most recent public interview peltier has even reluctantly conceded what he had previously denied that he had in fact gone down to where the agents were executed still he openly states that he feels no guilt no remorse nor even any regret for the murders leonard peltier has lived a life of crime he has earned and deserves a lifetime of incarceration leonard peltier is a murderer without compassion or feeling towards his fellow man in turn he deserves no compassion mr president there is no justification for relieving leonard peltier from his punishment our judicial system has spoken in this case again again and again leonard peltier is a vicioug violent and cowardly criminal that hides behind legitimate native american issues leonard peltier was never a leader in the native american community he is simply a brute thug and murderer with no respect no regard for human life our citizens on and off the reservations must be protected from predators like peltier mr president since leonard peltier could not fool the federal courts he is now trying to fool you to fool the public he is shading and hiding the facts and playing on sympathy he and his advocates want to confuse the fact of his guilt with matters completely extraneous to that fact do not let him get away with it mr president sympathy is appropriate only for dead heroes and surviving families do not let their sacrifice be forgotten that was somewhat of a lengthy letter but as you can tell it is a subject that should be dear to every one of our hearts in this room to the heart of every american out there that believes in law and justice to every law enforcement family out there that currently has someone in law enfordement or has had a member of their family in law enforcement if we let if we let this kind of violent assassin out of prison after serving only 24 years it will in my opinion be a crippling blow to the message that we need to send to the law enforcement in this country that message really is fairly simple that is that you work as a law enforcement officer to provide as your duty peace and justice in our system and that when eace and justice are attacked in our system our system has a price it has a consequence it has a punishment it is the only way we can uphold the integrity of our system of law enforcement is to have a zero tolerance or a limited tolerance of any type of direct attack against our system of peace and justice the assassination of two federal bureau of investigation agents no matter how many years ago is a direct attack against the legal and justice process in this country i urge all my colleagues to join with me in attempting to be persuasive with the president of the united states and the american public in saying how important it is that this politicalcharade being put on by the defense attorneys for this convicted assassin that this kind of show be stopped that this kind of show be denied their goal their goal of course is to let this convicted assassin walk the streets of america again do not let him hide under the shield of being a native american that is a disgrace to the native americans do not pull native americans down to the level of this convicted killer do not affiliate this convicted killer with the native americans in this country that is an insult in my opinion if we do do not forget the facts of the case just so that i can remind the members let me go through the facts again in a little briefer form than the letter two fbi agents were assassinated they attempted to pursue a vehicle which contained this suspect at the time suspect now a convicted killer leonard peltier they were wounded they were disarmed by the wounds that they had in othef words they could not fight back they didnt have any weapons left to fight back with they were not physically capable one the fbi agents was unconscious the other fbi agent was rendering first aid to the unconscious fbi agent this convicted killer who by the way was a fugitive from justice for the attempted assassination of an offduty police officer in milwaukee walked up to these two fbi agents and executed them in cold blood he was later stopped in a recreational vehicle in that vehicle they found one of the deceased agents pistols in a paper bag that bag had evidence peltiers fingerprints on it peltier was captured in canada he was convicted of two counts of murder for these fbi agents he escaped from the federal prison do not let people tell us this guy is a nonviolent guy he was in federal prison and he shot his way out of federal prison think of the last time since the john dillinger days or bonnie and clyde and so on that somebody shot their way out of the federal prison that is who this individual is now today now today he is in front of the american people in front of the president of the united states asking for mercy look 25 years ago may seem like a long time to some but it has been a real long time for the families of those young fbi agents that were assassinated in cold blood in conclusion on this particular issue let me ask for members support in standing up strong for the law enforcement community of the country in standing up strong for the families and the agents and professionals of the federal bureau of investigation in standing up strong for the concept of peace and justice within the boundaries of our country let us all have our voice heard that in the united states of america if you assassinate a police officer or just as soon two federal bureau of investigation officers you will pay a price and we will stick with the punishment that we deal out we are not a bunch of patsies do not come back to us and think you are going to get a free walk 25 years later after that kind of action if we fail to do this if we fail to do this we are sending the wrong message out there and we are crippling justice and peace in our country i would like to do an update on a couple of other subjects this evening while i have the opportunity to visit with the members as members will recall about 2 or 3 weeks ago maybe a month ago there is a museum in new york city called the brooklyn art museum the brooklyn art museum it was discovered with taxpayer dollars with taxpayer dollars was sponsoring an art exhibit that depicted among other things a portrait of the virgin mary which is one of the holiest symbols of the catholic religion throughout the world and of christianity throughout the world this art museum was allowingin this art exhibit with taxpayer dollars this portrait of the virgin mary with elephant dung as they say crap as i say thrown all over the portrait can members imagine that how long do members think that type of art exhibit would have been tolerated or should have been tolerated in this country at taxpayer dollars if it was an exhibit of martin luther king for example or if it were an exhibit of an outstanding jewish rabbi for example or if it were an exhibit of some other outstanding leader that meant so much to a religious organization anywhere in this world they would not put up with that but for some reason there seems to be some justification out there by some people that an attack on christianity should be separated from an attack say on martin luther king or an attack on the image of a jewish rabbi and so on and so forth what happened is that the mayor of new york city mayor rudy giuliani i think had some guts he stood up and he said we are drawing the line that has gone too far there is a strong freedom of expression in this country there is a first amendment in this country but there is a balance that we have in this country just the same as under the freedom of speech we do not allow individuals to go into a theater and yell fire fire fire we do not allow that that is not a violation of your first amendment rights but we do not allow you to go into a theater and do that we draw a line this thing is not carte blanche this first amendment to do anything that you feel like doing especially when you do it with taxpayer dollars the mayor came under heavy criticism by the very elite that were dealing with the brooklyn art museum the board of directors who i think were acting very pompous in somehow defending this disgraceful work of art not a work of art that is just controversial that brings up lots of discussion but a work of art that hit at the very integrity of a large religious group throughout the world that was the maximum type of insult that you could throw at that particular religion and did it with ainerican taxpayer dollars why do i keep bringing up the fact of american taxpayer dollars because therein lies the distinction as to whether or not this is an issue under the first amendment of our constitution under our constitution frankly had the united states taxpayer dollars not been used to fund this portrait of the virgin mary of which dung was thrown all over it had taxpayer dollars not been used i am afraid to say that this would have been probably protected or would have been protected underthe first amendment we can tolerate that it is horrible and i cannot imagine for example why the first lady hillary clinton stood up for this thing she said however in her comments that while she would not go see it but she certainly stood up for the right to go around and exhibit this with taxpayer dollars iunderstand where some would say it is a first amendment right if there is not taxpayer dollars being used although i can tell the members that the press in this country and the liberal left in this country would not have stood for 2 seconds if it were martin luther king or a jewish rabbi or some other celebrated figure being treated in that fashion but the key here is taxpayer dollars 0 2320 the point here is very clear and i think the citizens of this country i think we need to go out and ask our constituents do the citizens of this country really think it is a justified and constitutionally protected right under the constitution to fund this kind of art with taxpayer dollars or should this type of art be denied the access of taxpayer dollars and allowed to be funded in society with private dollars remember that my objection tonight and the mayor of new york citys objection to this art was not that the art should iot be shown now it is disgraceful do not get me wrong i do not condone this kind of art but there is a constitutionally protected right to show this art without taxpayer dollars that argument has some legitimacy but that was not the debate that is being carried forward here what the mayor said what i said and mr speaker what i think most of our constituents believe is that this kind of art i e the virgin mary with dung splashed all over her with taxpayer dollars has gone over that line you draw a line you have gone over that line do not use taxpayer dollars the brooklyn art museum in new york they could easily fund this through other monies they just want to try and make an issue what they want to do is open that door so that taxpayers in this country will have to pay out of their hardearned dollars will have to use those taxpayer dollars to let the socalled art community especially the elite of the brooklyn art museum fund anything they would like no matter how offensive no matter how derogatory it is that is wrong this art museum knows that it is wrong well there has been a new step a new report to update you on and that is that a federal court judge this week actually came out and said that the art museum has a right to use taxpayer dollars to exhibit this type of art i e the virgin mary with dung thrown all over her in very obviously a disgraceful fashion intended to be as derogatory as possible not only towards christianity but towards one of the most important symbols of christianity i am telling you federal judge you made a mistake you are wrong there is not a constitutionally protected provision that says you can use taxpayer dollars in this country to fund that kind of art why do you not use some common sense why do you have to offend the people of christianity why do you do an allout attack you would not do it with martin luther king and the black community you would not do it in the jewish community with some rabbi of theirs you would not do it with some other type of religious entity or important entity in this country with their leader why are you doing this why do you decide to use taxpayer dollars to offend every christian in the world it is wrong you have got a temporary victory from this federal judge but in the end i think the mayor of new york city one had a lot of guts to do what he did and number two i think he is going to prevail i also think that the general opinion in this country is look that kind of art as violent and as horrible and as disgraceful as it is is protected but not with the use of taxpayer dollars our constituents i do not believe are in any way about to buy the argument that we ought to take the tax dollars out of their paycheck every week and put a percentage of that towards the funding of this kind of art"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "absolutely our governor governor bill owens is one who is looking forward to a day when there is greater flexibility

regulations that hamper their ability to teach children in an effective way we spend billions of dollars here in washington and yet for the billions we spend the actual proportion of federal funds that actually reach a classroom is relatively small somewhere on the order of 7 6 sometimes as high as 9 percent in some needy or poorer school districts but for that small relatively small portion of federal funds that make up an overall classroom budget the strings and the red tape and the requirements and mandates attached to that minority of cash is overpowering there are school districts in my state that have to hire people just to fill out the federal paperwork so that they can get the money this is money that comes to washington the american taxpayers are working hard every day and paying their taxes the money comes here to washington d c the congress then through its formulas and so on divvies up this cash in a variety of ways and then there is this huge bureaucracy not too far from where we are now that then goes to work on this money by the time that cash makes its way back to colorado and back to the state of georgia and every other state in the union there is just a fraction left for the kids that is what our straight as proposal is designed to resolve not to spend more money in washington we do not need to do that we can actually increase the proportion of dollars that

they oppose straight as and with good reason our goal is to get rid of a lot of those people i will be candid and frank with the gentleman and with them and with the american people i frankly care more about ffiy children in public schools and all of the children of my friends and neighbors back in colorado than i do about these people down the street here in the department of education i want the money to get to the kids and to the teachers who know how to teach rather than the bureaucrats who know how to provide paperwork and produce more headaches for communities around the country this straight as proposal it is a big thing there are 760 federal education programs the edflex bill that we passed dealt with i think 9 of them 9 significant ones it was a big step in the right direction to follow up to take the next logical step to show the american people that we are serious about moving authority out of washington and empowering our local communities this straight as proposal is a significant one i might add that we have almost 100 cosponsors now in this congress including on our side of the aisle the republican side every member of that committee is on board every member of our republican leadership is on board it is a bipartisan bill we have democrats who are cosponsors of straight as this is a big initiative and an exciting one and the gentleman is right before i turn

says military families redeemed a huge 21 million worth of wic coupons in defense commissaries last year even with that government help the millers cannot afford the insurance copayment to have their sons cavities filled i further want to quote an interview with david lewis david lewis is a retired warrant officer and his quote is i think the biggest problem is that they just dont have enough going back to tom jarriel again the reporter for abcs 20 20 and he says retired warrant officer david lewis a hardened combat veteran of 26 years in the marine corps teaches financial planning to thousands of marines a year at camp pendleton david lewis further states at first it really bothered me that they did not have enough pride in themselves and i said quoting david lewis well wait a minute it doesnt have anything to do with pride it probably took more courage for that kid to get food it probably took a lot of courage for that kid to say i cannot take care of my family i need help

troops do not even earn minimum wage that is why i am on the floor today and i have been once a week ever since we got back in february i introduced h r 1055 which would help our men and women in

democratic leadership to please let us not leave here in september or october and not speak to those who are serving our nation those who are willing to die for this country that are on food stamps to me that is unacceptable that to me is what i think america stands for is to help those in uniform who are willing to give their lives for this country what i have before me today is a marine this marine is getting ready to deploy to bosnia we seem to be able to find 9 million to 10 million for bosnia we have already spent 10 billion to 11 billion in yugoslavia yet this cost to pass h r 1055 to get a 500 tax credit for those on food stamps would only cost this government 59 million over 10 years roughly 5 million a year i will be the first to say this will not get them off food stamps but what i will say is that it will say to those in the military who are on food stamps that we in the congress are concerned about the fact that they are on food stamps and they are willing to die for this country i look at the other bills that we pass in the senate and the house and we can find billions of dollars in tax credits for tysons food to study chicken manure and how this might help with energy problems i say let us take care of those first who are willing to take care of america they are our men and women in uniform who are on food stamps i look at this little girl megan is her name she is standing on the feet of her daddy do you know what that serious look that she has she is looking at a camera in his arms he has his daughter brittany i am thinking about megan she does not know this at her age but her daddy might not come back he might not come back he is willing to give his life for this country this marine represents all of our military in both air force navy army and

taxes and interest for the future this is historic because over 10 years the federal budget has been taking social security funds to pay for other spending programs in the year 2000 the gop sets aside 137 billion that is 100 percent of social security monies for social security the president pledges 62 percent of that that is 85 billion and 52 billion of social security money spent for other programs between the years 2000 and 2009 we set aside 1 8 trillion for social security and medicare the presidents budget sets aside 1 3 trillion for social security and earmarks about 345 billion for medicare that is 1 645 trillion over 100 billion less than our budget no matter how we add it up 137 billion is more than 85 billion no matter how we add it up 1 8 trillion is more than 1 645 trillion

reform he cuts medicare by 11 9 billion he is using a very strange strategy for claiming the high ground on medicare one he cuts billions from medicare two he saves less than republicans for medicare three he singlehandedly stops bipartisan medicare reform from the medicare commission four he leaves us with the status quo five he then claims to be the champion of medicare if we look at the facts we know that the committee on the budget resolution does more to protect social security and medicare than the president has ever done also anyone who votes for the presidents budget is doing nothing short of stealing from social security and cutting medicare i urge all my colleagues to vote for the gop budget"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as i mentioned we in tile committee yesterday marked up bills to improve the census and you would think they would want to have the ideas of congress like the postcensus local review give those local officials like they had in 1990 a chance to have a quality check another issue they are opposing and let me tell my colleagues this they are opposing making the census form available in numerous languages and braille they said we are going to put it in five languages besides english and if you know of another language tough you have to call an 800 number and hopefully you will find somebody who can translate and if you are blind you know tough i mean what do you do that is so sad they are opposed to it it is not that difficult to make available forms for those that request it to get these forms i was in miami we had a hearing back in december the gentlewoman from florida has about 150 000 haitians in her district now a lot of them have not learned english yet and how do they fill out a form our colleague the gentleman from california from long beach he has about 50 000 cambodians in his district now how do they fill out a form if an elderly person now somebody would say oh they should not be counted but everybody living in this country gets counted it is required by our united states constitution and here is amazing this is the democratic party that wants to reach out to everybody and they are refusing to publish the seven questions only seven questions in these languages and one of our bills is to put it out in 33 languages plus braille rather than the five languages their argument is well our five languages we get 99 percent of the people well 1 percent of the american people is 2 7 million people and we only missed 1 6 percent of the population last time why are they afraid to do that i mean it is the republicans are out there trying to make it more accessible to have everybody fill out the form and so i mean it is so frustrating that they say we are perfect we do not make mistakes and we are all professionals and you know do not micromanage well do not micromanage they are the ones that spent a billion dollars over the past 7 years on a illegal plan and it was not until january that they you know we got hit in the head they realized yes it was illegal and they said that is the reason we are going to go to two numbers i mean it is an amazing organization to deal with and these other ideas we are proposing it was another one they are opposed to is and this has support from general accounting office and at one time the academy of sciences supported it we get one form in the mail and you know hopefully everybody returns it we get as many as we can returned but if you send the second form as a reminder it will increase response rates by 6 or 7 percent they tried that out when they did what is called a dress rehearsal last year in sacramento and columbia south carolina they will get a 6 or 7 percent improvement on response rate that is about 19 million people that many fewer forms have to be filled out and they are opposed to it they are going to fight it and the president is going to veto it he is going to veto those 33 languages he is going to veto postcensus review i do not understand their logic it is so frustrating i mean even we had one program we debated for probably 45 minutes yesterday in committee it is something called census in the school program it is a good program and i hope when it becomes available that you can go to your schools and promote it especially when you go to the indian schools which we visited when we were in your district it was really kind of neat to see the indian schools there because what the census in school form is is going to be a form that is going to be sent out to the teachers of elementary schools in elementary schools and selected teachers in middle and secondary schools that teach geography i think government math i think three different categories and the idea is they will get a request if they want to participate in the program send back a card and they will get maps and materials and it is a good way to teach a civics lesson and you know they can teach mathematics they can teach geography there are lots of things kids can learn about the census and the constitution on it if the teachers want to so we are going to make it available the census bureau was only going to make it available to 20 percent of the schools and we think it is a good program so we commend them and say we think it should be made available to everybody all the schools they are contracting it out so it is not like extra work for them there is a group called scholastic inc that has got the contract and it is just a matter of sending the letter to all these teachers and if they like it send back a card and they fought us and fought us and fought us yesterday over that issue and they finally agreed to let it go by voice vote and i understand i said are you opposed to 60 percent of the teachers receiving this why are you opposed to the possibility of helping kids we can get members of congress to go to schools in their district to help promote it it is something that is good civics it is good public policy and you know they finally gave in and voice voted it was amazing"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as members of congress we have an obligation to report that the united states is vulnerable to a missile attack that is right some of the worlds most dangerous and unstable dictatorships are developing weapons which could reach the united states mainland the bipartisan rumsfeld commission has said we could soon face a missile strike with little or no warning yet our president is still reluctant to act on this important issue the north korean missile tests last summer forced administration officials to admit grudgingly that this threat is real but the presidents response has been weak it includes support for only a limited groundbased system with questionable value the administration also worries that a defense shield might violate the abm treaty the same pact the soviets violated for years each day we delay the threat of a missile attack increases congress is taking action to deploy an effective missile defense system i urge the president to join us in addressing this critical matter of national security"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "back home in colorado school is just getting underway three of those kids in public schools are my own and i care about education and i like most parents want the unitedstates department of education to get the money that it spends to the classroom i do not want to see the department waste any more on bureaucracy and red tape and i am tired of the theft the fraud and the abuse that goes on at the department of education that robs children of the precious resources they need we spend 40 million a year on accountants and overseers and auditors to make sure that the money the department gets does get to the children and the classroom but it was a car dealer in hyattsville maryland that found the latest fraud of department employees defrauding 2 million of the unitedstates department of education into personal bank accounts let us get money to the classroom let us get rid of the waste fraud and abuse at the unitedstates department of education let us put children before crime and bureaucracy"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "briefly i urge my colleagues to vote against this perverse and misguided motion to instruct i agree the trend of medicare choice plans pulling out of areas across the country is enormously disturbing but may i suggest to the folks on the other side that they have offered exactly the wrong solution by forcing plans to commit to 3 years we are ensuring that plans who are struggling to maintain their service will leave now right now medicare choice funding as the gentleman from california noted is too unpredictable under current hcfa policy this motion adds no accountability just a poison pill i find it ironic that the democrats and the president have spent the past week tearing apart the medicare bill that this house passed calling the money spent on medicare choice plans unjustified if anyone thinks that the money dedicated to shoring up medicare choice plans is unjustifiable i invite them to come to erie crawford and mercer county pennsylvania i invite them to explain that to seniors who are facing copays that will double in january and decrease benefits if they are indeed serious about stabilizing medicare choice then i urge our friends on the other side of the aisle to drop this and urge the president to sign the house package and work with us to ensure that seniors relying on these plans continue to have access to quality health care do not simply adopt populist poses and deploy vacant partisan rhetoric while requiring medicare choice plans to be at the mercy of hcfa for 3 years this is no solution they will simply leave and seniors will be left holding the bag"]]}
