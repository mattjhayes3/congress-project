global markets we call on japan a good friend of the united states to accept our call to bear a fair share of the worlds defense burden the cost of protecting freedom and the free markets should be borne evenly and proportionally by those who benefit from them this resolution gives japan an option if the japanese government feels that it cannot exceed their politically established 1 percent of gross national product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national product on defense last year i must add that i am extremely concerned over the recent export violations by toshiba machine co inc of japan while the united states is spending billions on national security a security that as ive discussed accrues great benefit to the japanese toshiba sold sophisticated propeller manufacturing equipment expressly prohibited by law to the soviet union this sale and unbelievably its accompanying service contract approved by the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti served as a veritable stab in the back of all americans our nation which has stood as the rebuilder and protector of a nation which at one time struck out in a violent act of hostility against our nation 46 years ago views this sale of ship and submarine quieting technology which occurred twice with particular disdain i am pleased to see the substantive steps taken by the japanese to get to the heart of the toshiba problem and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a copy of a recent article by richard perle president reagans former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy regarding the toshiba machine incident h j res 327 joint resolution requiring the president or his designee to enter into negotiations with japan for the purpose of having japan bear a greater share of the free worlds defense burden by either increasing its annual defense expenditures to at least 3 percent of japans gross national product or by obtaining payment by japan to the united states of the difference between 3 percent of japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to protect and augment freedom democracy and capitalism throughout the world the global markets upon which exporting nations depend would not be available whereas the recent developments in the persian gulf bring to light once again the dependence of our allies on the united states for the protection of strategic international sea lanes so vital to the industrialized democracies whereas 37 percent of the oil consumed by the united states 100 percent of the oil consumed by japan 100 percent of the oil consumed by west germany 94 percent of the oil consumed by france and 100 percent of the oil consumed by italy is imported whereas 4 percent of the oil consumed by the united states and 60 percent of the oil consumed by japan passes through the gulf of hormuz whereas there have been disturbing revelations that the japanese company toshiba machine has on two occasions sold strategic technological equipment to the soviet union which gives the soviets the ability to reduce the noise level of their submarines by a factor of twenty significantly undermining the security of the united states and the rest of the free world whereas at a time when the necessary financial commitment to national security is particularly burdensome to the american economy given its increasing national debt the trade deficit relatively high interest rates and the erosion of united states manufacturing jobs this sale with the approval of the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti is looked on with particular disdain whereas in 1985 the united states spent 7 percent of its gnp on defense the soviet union spent 14 percent of its gnp on defense our european allies spent an average 3 5 percent of their gnp on defense and japan spent 1 of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963 trillion in 1986 and had an inflation rate of 1 percent and an unemployment rate of 2 8 percent during the same period whereas the united states overall trade deficit in 1986 was 166 3 billion and 50 billion in the first three months of 1987 and

bargaining and negotiating will be made to appear a capricious ephemeral impulse rather than the serious policy initiative the president intended what congress simply doesnt understand is that no president can defend our interests in this or any other matter if his policies can be snapped around like a rubber band the march so evident in congress and in such executive agencies as the department of commerce to weaken export controls is lumbering forward behind the banner of competitiveness this years slogan masquerading as a policy the fellows who want to keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic red tapea complaint that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige whose department dispenses red tape by the mile echoes happily at industry lunches and in congressional testimony now if mac would put the time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the western alliance the president who has taken the lead in arguing for effective export controls will appear pale and depleted if he falls to take charge of the kongsbergtoshlba affair and abandoning policies aimed at protecting our

legislative action to return four pivotal civil rights laws to their rightful status prior to two supreme court decisions which occurred on february 28 1984 these decisions were grove city college v bell secretary of education 104 s ct 1211 1984 and consolidated rail corporation v darrone 104 s ct 1248 1984 the civil rights restoration act is intended to reestablish the fundainental principle that when any part of an organizational entity receives federal financial assistance then all of the operations of that entity are subject to the antidiscrimination requirements contained in four civil rights statutes the four laws to which i refer are first title ix of the education amendments of 1972 second title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 third the rehabilitation act of 1973 and fourth the age discrimination act each of these laws prohibits discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance title ix prohibits discrimination based upon sex title vi prohibits discrimination based upon race color or national origin section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 prohibits discrimination based upon a persons disability the age discrimination act prohibits discrimination based upon an individuals age so if you choose to participate in federal programs and receive federal financial aid you must comply with the antidiscrimination requirements of all four of these laws this seems to me a patently logical and fundamentally fair result the federal government should not be in the business of subsidizing discriminationinadertently or otherwise if you choose to discriminate or ignore discriminatory activities within the realm of your organizational control then you will not be aided and abetted in doing so through the use of taxpayer moneys allow me to briefly review the problems presented by the supreme court decisions in grove city and darrone and to explain further why i believe remedial legislation is necessary grove city college a private coeducational liberal arts college refused to sign the assurance of compliance certification under title ix grove city college asserted that it received no federal financial assistancethat is that it was not a recipient under title ix and consequently was not subject to the discrimination prohibitions of that statute the facts in the case were that no direct federal assistance went to the college but that some of the students attending grove city college received federal basic educational opportunity grants the supreme court held first that grove city was a recipient under title ix because receiving federal financial assistance includes federal aid to a student who uses the funds at a particular institution but the supreme court went on to construe program or activity as not meaning the operations of the entire college but only the student financial aid office that is where the beog money in fact ultimately went on virtually the same day in the darrone case the supreme court also gave the same restrictive interpretation to program or activity in section 50 1 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 immediately there was a critical reaction to the narrow and potentially damaging interpretation given to program or activity in both of these decisions in an education context the supreme court interpretation means for example that if sex discrimination occurs in the history department of a college but no federal funds expressly go to that particularly department then the college could continue to receive federal assistance despite this discrimination importantly since the phrase program or activity is also present in title vi and the age discrination act that same programspecific construction could be applied in cases under those laws soon after the supreme court action legislation was introduced both in the senate and in the house of representative to respond to the gave city problem these bills were intended to restore the four relevant laws to their status prior to the grove city decision the house bill in the 98th congress was favorably reported by both the education and labor committee and the judiciary committee this legislation passed the house of representatives on june 26 1984 by a vote of 375 to 32 however disagreement over the intended and actual scope of the bills language resulted time ran out and the senate did not take final action that bill ran into difficulty principally because it contained a broad and arguably ambiguous definition of recipient the bills definition differed in certain respects from the existing regulatory definitions of recipient for each of the four laws concern was expressed that this legislation was in fact being used to expand the coverage of these four laws to entirely new categories or classes of recipients subsequent versions reflect a sincere attempt to respond to those early criticism s 557 the bill we consider today is based upon a substitute developed from weeks of bipartisan negotiations in the spring of 1985 those negotiationsinvolving democrats and republicans from from both tile judiciary committee and the education and labor committeebrought about important improvements in the bill under this revised and still relevant format the existing regulatory definitions of recipient are left unchanged and importantly the exclusions for ulti ate beneflciaries farmers student medicare and medicaid recipients food stamp recipients and social security beneficiarieswhich are contained in three out of four regulatory definitions are retained so for example entities or persons such as farmers that are not recipents under the law now because they are ultimate beneficiaries would not have their status changed furthermore s 557 defines the phrase program or activity and attempts to bring that definition in line with executive branch enforcement policy as it existed prior to grove city and darrone this makes good sense in that it was the supreme courts restrictive interpretation of that phrase which prompts our legislative reaction under s 557 coverage under the four antidiscrimination laws would extend to first departments or agencies of a state or a local government second colleges universities or public systems of higher education third local education agencies or other elementary or secondary systems fourth corporations partnerships or other private or nonprofit organizations and fifth any other entity established by two or more of those previous entities in the case of this last cater ory other entity coverage presumably would occur depending upon whether or not the resulting entity is analogous in structure and purpose to the previous categories in the specified list s 557 also intends to leave the socalled pinpointing doctrine on fund termination unchanged see senate report no 10064 p 20 the landmark case on pinpointing is taylor v finch 414 f 2d 1068 1969 that doctrine holds that once a program or activity is receiving federal financial assistance and discrimination is found to exist then only those funds which actually support the discrimination would be cut off so for example if a municipal housing authority is found to be discriminating on the basis of race or sex or age or handicap only housing moneys are potentially terminated by not transportaon moneys or education moneys while as a practical matter fund termination is a negotiation tool and is utilized only as a last resort the intent of this legislation is to limit the potential scope of fund termination to those funds which actually have a specific nexus to the discrimination that is found as the members of this house know progress on the civil rights restoration act has been stalled since early 1985 because of a dispute over the possible abortion implications of this legislation now with adoption of the df nforth amendment in the senate ard the inclusion of that abortion neutral language in the bill before us today that 3year impasse is over for many of us a compromise on the abortion issue was a necessary prerequisite to the enactment of this legislation while that debate was understandable and important its unfortunate side effect was to distract many members from focusing on the very valid and fundamental policy reasons justifying the remaining portions of the bill but now that this issue has been satisfactorily resolved let us not be further distracted with passage colleges and universities will not be able to receive federal aid and discriminate against women or blacks or the handicapped in their admissions policies or hiring practices state and local governments similarly cannot continue to receive financial aid without assuring federal enforcement officials about equal opportunity in employment and nondiscriminatory disposition of those funds components of corporations will also have to comply with the basic elements of the four applicable civil rights laws today the house of representatives is faced with a policy choice that should not and cannot ignore the original rationale that prompted the enactment of these four laws these statutes were intended as deterrents to institutional discrimination and that fact ought not be overlooked or aban doned in this debate ultimately the question for us to answer is whether or not we want these laws to be enforced in a comprehensive and

funds for function 700 that places veterans medical care at less than a priority level as compared to a number of other programs the budget committee recommendation figures might indicate to some that they are 250 million over the presidents reestimated request for budget authority and budget outlays on closer look however we can see that such is not the case a recommended 1percent acrosstheboard decrease for va medicine relates to 150 mll lion absorption of onehalf of the cost of a federal pay raise relates to another 150 mil lion this 300 million in turn relates to a loss of about 3 000 employees in vas department of medicine and surgery this budget committee report is a far cry from current services for va medicine it means that va will treat fewer outpatients next year it means that fewer inpatients will be treated it means that quality medical care for veterans is in jeopardy it means a diminishing of the historic pledge of this body that it will always assure adequate funds for va medicine the house veterans affairs committee carefully studied the presidents budget and then made recommendations to the budget committee we were unanimous in those recommendations we said that the presidents budget ought to be very modestly amended upward for va medical care and for the administration of veterans benefits we recommended a very modest increase in construction funds to build three more nursing homes to try to take care of aging veterans we wanted to start work on a badly needed clinical addition and spinal cord injury unit at dallas tx we rejected a 1percent projected increase in productivity in va hospitals and clinics because medical care is just not measured that way in essence we asked for a budget to adequately provide current services with only bare bones enhancemerits already fully justified these were modest but vitally needed recommendations we tried to be responsible we trisd to be frugal however it seems obvious that this budget resolution was preordained by the economic summit agreements of last decomber i say this because of the very quick action of the budget committee in reporting it to us i was not party to that agreement and do not feel compelled to support any part of it that does harm to va medicine i believe the veterans of this nation deserve a quality medical program i intend always to lend my best efforts in that

in mind the many compelling arguments for not codifying the fairness doctrine as i listened to the panelists that came before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee during the recent hearing conducted on this legislation i was struck by one overriding impression the codification of the fairness doctrine cannot be justified unless one accepts the spectrum scarcity rationale sheer weight of numbers prevents me from accepting this argument there are now approximately 10 000 radio stations and 1 300 television stations reaching 98 2 percent of all unitedstates households with the availability of home dishes cable vcrs and microwave technology there are numerous sources of information for broadcast audiences to choose from although no one is even suggesting that we consider applying the fairness doctrine to newspapers it is interesting to contrast the broadcast numbers with the figures for the print media for example there are only 1 700 daily newspapers in this country and many major cities are only one or twopaper towns yet 96 percent of unitedstates households receive five or more television signals and 71 percent of all households receive nine or more signals in addition there are 7 300 cable systems reaching 46 percent of homes in the united states far from a scarcity the numbers indicate convincingly that the broadcast audience has a great many information alternatives available as my good friend the gentleman from iowa perceptively pointed out at the subcommittee hearing on h r 1934 in considering the spectrum scarcity rationale a distinction must be made between the availability of opportunities to broadcast programming and the availability of the opportunities to receive programming proponents of this bill have continually focused on the former distinction when the very purposes of the fairness doctrine command that we focus on the latter distinction i am concerned that enacting the fairness doctrine will intrude on the constitutional rights of broadcasters i see the fairness doctrine as a dangerous precedent of government regulation over content government officials should not be dictating broadcast contentthat should be determined

body to the fair housing amendments act of 1988 my colleagues will recall that the house considered the fair housing legislation on june 22 and june 23 and finally approved the legislation on june 29 subsequently when the housepassed bill went to the other body a series of negotiations ensued to resolve the remaining differences between the civil rights community and the administration our purpose here today is to consider and hopefully accept the changes to h r 1158 adopted by the senate it should be pointed out that these changes have the support of the unitedstates department of housing and urban development the department of justice as well as key elements in the business community principally the national association of realtors and the national association of home builders the amendments adopted in the other body do no harm to the spirit of the balanced compromise approved by this house just a few weeks ago in fact many of these amendments serve to enhance and reinforce some of the provisions contained in that compromise for example many members of this house were concerned about the potential adverse impact that the coverage of families with children could have on senior citizens retirement communities under the language of one notable senate amendment existing senior citizen communities will have increased flexibility and possibility to qualify for the exemption from the familial status requirements just as important is the senateadded language providing a transition period for the current residents of housing that excludes children they will not be required to leave that housing nor will they be subject to eviction that is existing residents whose presence in a community or apartment complex might otherwise cause the community to fall outside the protections in section 807 b 2 will not be counted in calculating whether the exemption should apply the bottom line is that senior citizens retirement communities across the united states will have a greater chance of qualifying for the housing for older persons exemption furthermore no one will be evicted whether in a senior citizens community or an alladult community because of the enactment of this bill litigation authority was also an issue when we considered h r 1158 on this floor approximately 6 weeks ago the language contained in the bill before the house today fully consolidates in the department of justice the authority to represent the federal government in all of the enforcement actions under the fair housing act however while the litigation will be conducted by lawyers from the department of justice the decision as to whether or not prompt judicial action is necessary to obtain injunctive relief or to seek court enforcement of a finding of discriminatirn will still be lodged with the secretary of housing and urban development so under the latest compromise the secretary will decide whether or not litigation should occur where the secretary authorizes the litigation it is transmitted to the attorney general and lie is required to promptly commence and maintain such action consistent with the terms of the senate amendment the amended version of h r 1158 also contains a technical amendment to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies making it clear that certain interim certifications by hud are included in the bill the language adopted in the other body also makes it clear that this legislation is not requiring the establishment of a federal building code because of the accessibility and adaptability requirement for newly constructed multifamlly dwellings these and the other changes made in h r 1158 are improvements and refinements fully consistent with the spirit of the housepassed compromise bill we are in the final stretch run of a circuitous race that began nearly 10 years ago this bipartisan effortto strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1968 law and expand the coverage of the fair housing protections under title viii of the civil rights acthas tested the stamina of many of us in this house my good friend and distinguished colleague from california civil and constitutional rights subcommittee chairman don edwards in particular is to be commended for his patience determination and effective leadership in this effort we are on the threshold of finally passing a federal fair housing law that is workable and effective thirtysix million disabled persons will receive the protections of this fundamental civil rights statute families with children will no longer be arbitrarily limited in their choice of decent housing the secretary of hud will have new and significant powers to investigate discrimination complaints and to enforce the rights guaranteed under this statute if discrimination is found and proven state and local fair housing agencies will contintic their vital integral role in fair housing enforcement all across the united states the states and localities are given an adequate grace period to bring their statutes and ordinances in line with the new federal law so that they can continue to handle a majority of these fair housing complaints complainants and respondents in fair housing discrimination cases are guaranteed due process rights in administrative proceedings and the fundamental right to a trial by jury in a unitedstates district court in instances where they so elect either the adjudication or the trial that results from the election is intended to be a final decision concerning the claims raised by the aggrieved person or any intervenor the aggrieved person or any intervenor may not relitigate the same claims raised in the complaint or seek additional or alternative relief through a direct action in federal court as was reflected in the colloquy between the gentleman from california and myself during consideration of this legislation in june res judicata applies and the intent is that claims based upon the same set of facts should be consolidated into one case before concluding i want to take this one last opportunity to mention some of the individuals who over the years have made positive and prominent contributions to this effort i have already noted and want to reinforce the tremendous contribution made by the gentleman from california the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner deserves special recognition our thanks go to the secretary of housing and urban development sam pierce for his pivotal role in this entire effort through his 8 years in office as the hud secretary sam pierce has consistently and staunchly advocated fair housing reform now on the threshold of a final success secretary pierce deserves acknowledgment and acclaim for his many contributions in addition i also want to give muchdeserved credit to our former colleague and friend from the other body the distinguished senator from maryland charles mcc mathias for many years mac was the principal sponsor of this legislation in the senate and was always ready and willing to lend his time and his advice to this effort pivotal players over the years have been ralph neas the executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights as well as my good friend althea simmons executive director washington office of the naacp kerry scanlon of the washington lawyers committee for civil rights under law wade henderson of the aclu and penda hair of the naacp legal defense fund also brought their usual fairness and balance to this effort the compromise that brought about prompt approval of this legislation in the house of representatives just a few weeks ago could never have occurred without the assistance of these and other representatives of the civil rights community their willingness to compromise was the key this is also an appropriate time to give recognition to many of the unsung heroes which you may not read about in the newspapers but nevertheless have made major contributions to the development of this legislation and its prospects for success from the staff of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights chief counsel catherine leroy associate counsel stuart ishimaru and minority counsel alan slobodin i also want to express grateful thanks and appreciation to marion morris who served for 4 years as the legislative assistant to

our aviation system today tell them it is because in the house of representatives we were not allowed to vote on the solution to this problem for indeed the tragedy here is there is a solution the reason we have chaos in our airlines and aviation today is because of the enormous success of airline deregulation which has brought about a 65percent increase in the number of passengers flying over 460 million passengers are now flying it has created a tremendous overload on our aviation system but there is a solution an obvious solution the solution is to expand the system to spend the money to

and then we break the promise we break faith with those people we take their money we tax them but we do not spend the money to improve the system there is a solution the solution is to free up the

care about supporting constituents so we can eliminate the terrible chaos and indeed the question of increased unsafety in our aviation system if the members care about safety then the members care

product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national product on defense last year i must add that i am extremely concerned over the recent export violations by toshiba machine co inc of japan while the united states is spending billions on national security a security that as ive discussed accrues great benefit to the japanese toshiba sold sophisticated propeller manufacturing equipment expressly prohibited by law to the soviet union this sale and unbelievably its accompanying service contract approved by the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti served as a veritable stab in the back of all americans our nation which has stood as the rebuilder and protector of a nation which at one time struck out in a violent act of hostility against our nation 46 years ago views this sale of ship and submarine quieting technology which occurred twice with particular disdain i am pleased to see the substantive steps taken by the japanese to get to the heart of the toshiba problem and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a copy of a recent article by richard perle president reagans former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy regarding the toshiba machine incident h j res 327 joint resolution requiring the president or his designee to enter into negotiations with japan for the purpose of having japan bear a greater share of the free worlds defense burden by either increasing its annual defense expenditures to at least 3 percent of japans gross national product or by obtaining payment by japan to the united states of the difference between 3 percent of japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to protect and augment freedom democracy and capitalism throughout the world the global markets upon which exporting nations depend would not be available whereas the recent developments in the persian gulf bring to light once again the dependence of our allies on the united states for the protection of strategic international sea lanes so vital to the industrialized democracies whereas 37 percent of the oil consumed by the united states 100 percent of the oil consumed by japan 100 percent of the oil consumed by west germany 94 percent of the oil consumed by france and 100 percent of the oil consumed by italy is imported whereas 4 percent of the oil consumed by the united states and 60 percent of the oil consumed by japan passes through the gulf of hormuz whereas there have been disturbing revelations that the japanese company toshiba machine has on two occasions sold strategic technological equipment to the soviet union which gives the soviets the ability to reduce the noise level of their submarines by a factor of twenty significantly undermining the security of the united states and the rest of the free world whereas at a time when the necessary financial commitment to national security is particularly burdensome to the american economy given its increasing national debt the trade deficit relatively high interest rates and the erosion of united states manufacturing jobs this sale with the approval of the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti is looked on with particular disdain whereas in 1985 the united states spent 7 percent of its gnp on defense the soviet union spent 14 percent of its gnp on defense our european allies spent an average 3 5 percent of their gnp on defense and japan spent 1 of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963 trillion in 1986 and had an inflation rate of 1 percent and an unemployment rate of 2 8 percent during the same period whereas the united states overall trade deficit in 1986 was 166 3 billion and 50 billion in the first three months of 1987 and our trade deficit with japan alone was 58 6 billion in 1986 whereas with soviet aggression in af for one year for the rest of the huge corpoghanistan soviet inroads in central amer ration it will be business as usual c

consequences of such an indiscriminate policy having voted consistently to slash unitedstates defenses bonker and his house allies would now imperil us further by facilitating soviet acquisition of

restricting the flow of technology tothe soviets thus passage of the house or even the senate bill as it now stands would do irreparable damage to our credibility abroad six years of cajoling pleading bargaining and negotiating will be made to appear a capricious ephemeral impulse rather than the serious policy initiative the president intended what congress simply doesnt understand is that no president can defend our interests in this or any other matter if his policies can be snapped around like a rubber band the march so evident in congress and in such executive agencies as the department of commerce to weaken export controls is lumbering forward behind the banner of competitiveness this years slogan masquerading as a policy the fellows who want to keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic red tapea complaint that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige whose department dispenses red tape by the mile echoes happily at industry lunches and in congressional testimony now if mac would put the time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the western alliance the president who has taken the lead in arguing for effective export controls will appear pale and depleted if he falls to take charge of the kongsbergtoshlba affair and abandoning policies aimed at protecting our

legislative action to return four pivotal civil rights laws to their rightful status prior to two supreme court decisions which occurred on february 28 1984 these decisions were grove city college v bell secretary of education 104 s ct 1211 1984 and consolidated rail corporation v darrone 104 s ct 1248 1984 the civil rights restoration act is intended to reestablish the fundainental principle that when any part of an organizational entity receives federal financial assistance then all of the operations of that entity are subject to the antidiscrimination requirements contained in four civil rights statutes the four laws to which i refer are first title ix of the education amendments of 1972 second title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 third the rehabilitation act of 1973 and fourth the age discrimination act each of these laws prohibits discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance title ix prohibits discrimination based upon sex title vi prohibits discrimination based upon race color or national origin section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 prohibits discrimination based upon a persons disability the age discrimination act prohibits discrimination based upon an individuals age so if you choose to participate in federal programs and receive federal financial aid you must comply with the antidiscrimination requirements of all four of these laws this seems to me a patently logical and fundamentally fair result the federal government should not be in the business of subsidizing discriminationinadertently or otherwise if you choose to discriminate or ignore discriminatory activities within the realm of your organizational control then you will not be aided and abetted in doing so through the use of taxpayer moneys allow me to briefly review the problems presented by the supreme court decisions in grove city and darrone and to explain further why i believe remedial legislation is necessary grove city college a private coeducational liberal arts college refused to sign the assurance of compliance certification under title ix grove city college asserted that it received no federal financial assistancethat is that it was not a recipient under title ix and consequently was not subject to the discrimination prohibitions of that statute the facts in the case were that no direct federal assistance went to the college but that some of the students attending grove city college received federal basic educational opportunity grants the supreme court held first that grove city was a recipient under title ix because receiving federal financial assistance includes federal aid to a student who uses the funds at a particular institution but the supreme court went on to construe program or activity as not meaning the operations of the entire college but only the student financial aid office that is where the beog money in fact ultimately went on virtually the same day in the darrone case the supreme court also gave the same restrictive interpretation to program or activity in section 50 1 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 immediately there was a critical reaction to the narrow and potentially damaging interpretation given to program or activity in both of these decisions in an education context the supreme court interpretation means for example that if sex discrimination occurs in the history department of a college but no federal funds expressly go to that particularly department then the college could continue to receive federal assistance despite this discrimination importantly since the phrase program or activity is also present in title vi and the age discrination act that same programspecific construction could be applied in cases under those laws soon after the supreme court action legislation was introduced both in the senate and in the house of representative to respond to the gave city problem these bills were intended to restore the four relevant laws to their status prior to the grove city decision the house bill in the 98th congress was favorably reported by both the education and labor committee and the judiciary committee this legislation passed the house of representatives on june 26 1984 by a vote of 375 to 32 however disagreement over the intended and actual scope of the bills language resulted time ran out and the senate did not take final action that bill ran into difficulty principally because it contained a broad and arguably ambiguous definition of recipient the bills definition differed in certain respects from the existing regulatory definitions of recipient for each of the four laws concern was expressed that this legislation was in fact being used to expand the coverage of these four laws to entirely new categories or classes of recipients subsequent versions reflect a sincere attempt to respond to those early criticism s 557 the bill we consider today is based upon a substitute developed from weeks of bipartisan negotiations in the spring of 1985 those negotiationsinvolving democrats and republicans from from both tile judiciary committee and the education and labor committeebrought about important improvements in the bill under this revised and still relevant format the existing regulatory definitions of recipient are left unchanged and importantly the exclusions for ulti ate beneflciaries farmers student medicare and medicaid recipients food stamp recipients and social security beneficiarieswhich are contained in three out of four regulatory definitions are retained so for example entities or persons such as farmers that are not recipents under the law now because they are ultimate beneficiaries would not have their status changed furthermore s 557 defines the phrase program or activity and attempts to bring that definition in line with executive branch enforcement policy as it existed prior to grove city and darrone this makes good sense in that it was the supreme courts restrictive interpretation of that phrase which prompts our legislative reaction under s 557 coverage under the four antidiscrimination laws would extend to first departments or agencies of a state or a local government second colleges universities or public systems of higher education third local education agencies or other elementary or secondary systems fourth corporations partnerships or other private or nonprofit organizations and fifth any other entity established by two or more of those previous entities in the case of this last cater ory other entity coverage presumably would occur depending upon whether or not the resulting entity is analogous in structure and purpose to the previous categories in the specified list s 557 also intends to leave the socalled pinpointing doctrine on fund termination unchanged see senate report no 10064 p 20 the landmark case on pinpointing is taylor v finch 414 f 2d 1068 1969 that doctrine holds that once a program or activity is receiving federal financial assistance and discrimination is found to exist then only those funds which actually support the discrimination would be cut off so for example if a municipal housing authority is found to be discriminating on the basis of race or sex or age or handicap only housing moneys are potentially terminated by not transportaon moneys or education moneys while as a practical matter fund termination is a negotiation tool and is utilized only as a last resort the intent of this legislation is to limit the potential scope of fund termination to those funds which actually have a specific nexus to the discrimination that is found as the members of this house know progress on the civil rights restoration act has been stalled since early 1985 because of a dispute over the possible abortion implications of this legislation now with adoption of the df nforth amendment in the senate ard the inclusion of that abortion neutral language in the bill before us today that 3year impasse is over for many of us a compromise on the abortion issue was a necessary prerequisite to the enactment of this legislation while that debate was understandable and important its unfortunate side effect was to distract many members from focusing on the very valid and fundamental policy reasons justifying the remaining portions of the bill but now that this issue has been satisfactorily resolved let us not be further distracted with passage colleges and universities will not be able to receive federal aid and discriminate against women or blacks or the handicapped in their admissions policies or hiring practices state and local governments similarly cannot continue to receive financial aid without assuring federal enforcement officials about equal opportunity in employment and nondiscriminatory disposition of those funds components of corporations will also have to comply with the basic elements of the four applicable civil rights laws today the house of representatives is faced with a policy choice that should not and cannot ignore the original rationale that prompted the enactment of these four laws these statutes were intended as deterrents to institutional discrimination and that fact ought not be overlooked or aban doned in this debate ultimately the question for us to answer is whether or not we want these laws to be enforced in a comprehensive and effective manner"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as an original cosponsor of this legislation introduced by my colleague bob dornan i urge all members to support this timely statement of outrage at the ceausescu

entire house veterans affairs committee that at the very least the medical program of the veterans administration should be funded at a current services level this budget resolution falls considerably short of current services and therefore is of groat concern to me the resolution may look all right at first glance on further examination however it is clear that the budget committee has recommended funds for function 700 that places veterans medical care at less than a priority level as compared to a number of other programs the budget committee recommendation figures might indicate to some that they are 250 million over the presidents reestimated request for budget authority and budget outlays on closer look however we can see that such is not the case a recommended 1percent acrosstheboard decrease for va medicine relates to 150 mll lion absorption of onehalf of the cost of a federal pay raise relates to another 150 mil lion this 300 million in turn relates to a loss of about 3 000 employees in vas department of medicine and surgery this budget committee report is a far cry from current services for va medicine it means that va will treat fewer outpatients next year it means that fewer inpatients will be treated it means that quality medical care for veterans is in jeopardy it means a diminishing of the historic pledge of this body that it will always assure adequate funds for va medicine the house veterans affairs committee carefully studied the presidents budget and then made recommendations to the budget committee we were unanimous in those recommendations we said that the presidents budget ought to be very modestly amended upward for va medical care and for the administration of veterans benefits we recommended a very modest increase in construction funds to build three more nursing homes to try to take care of aging veterans we wanted to start work on a badly needed clinical addition and spinal cord injury unit at dallas tx we rejected a 1percent projected increase in productivity in va hospitals and clinics because medical care is just not measured that way in essence we asked for a budget to adequately provide current services with only bare bones enhancemerits already fully justified these were modest but vitally needed recommendations we tried to be responsible we trisd to be frugal however it seems obvious that this budget resolution was preordained by the economic summit agreements of last decomber i say this because of the very quick action of the budget committee in reporting it to us i was not party to that agreement and do

in mind the many compelling arguments for not codifying the fairness doctrine as i listened to the panelists that came before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee during the recent hearing conducted on this legislation i was struck by one overriding impression the codification of the fairness doctrine cannot be justified unless one accepts the spectrum scarcity rationale sheer weight of numbers prevents me from accepting this argument there are now approximately 10 000 radio stations and 1 300 television stations reaching 98 2 percent of all unitedstates households with the availability of home dishes cable vcrs and microwave technology there are numerous sources of information for broadcast audiences to choose from although no one is even suggesting that we consider applying the fairness doctrine to newspapers it is interesting to contrast the broadcast numbers with the figures for the print media for example there are only 1 700 daily newspapers in this country and many major cities are only one or twopaper towns yet 96 percent of unitedstates households receive five or more television signals and 71 percent of all households receive nine or more signals in addition there are 7 300 cable systems reaching 46 percent of homes in the united states far from a scarcity the numbers indicate convincingly that the broadcast audience has a great many information alternatives available as my good friend the gentleman from iowa perceptively pointed out at the subcommittee hearing on h r 1934 in considering the spectrum scarcity rationale a distinction must be made between the availability of opportunities to broadcast programming and the availability of the opportunities to receive programming proponents of this bill have continually focused on the former distinction when the very purposes of the fairness doctrine command that we focus on the latter distinction i am concerned that enacting the fairness doctrine will intrude on the constitutional rights of broadcasters i see the fairness doctrine as a dangerous precedent of government regulation over content government officials should not be dictating broadcast contentthat should be determined solely by the tastes and information needs of the people the dial of the television set is a far more desirable regulatory tool than a vague concept of fairness enforced by a government agency"]]}
