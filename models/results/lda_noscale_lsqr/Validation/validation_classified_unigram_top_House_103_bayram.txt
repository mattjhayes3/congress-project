could be improved that the effort would be made to do so however we demonstrated in the house of representatives a week ago that it could be improved by the vote that we took to send the bill back to conference i believe we have a better bill today than we had a week ago i want to sincerely congratulate both the republicans and the democrats who worked on the bill nevertheless if we can improve it

further improved if we work on it further however the question arises what about the need to fight crime right now i believe that that need is met by supporting what will be introduced by the

better heed that demand and correct the way congress does the publics business as new members many of us do not feel party to the mistakes of the past our concern is the future as mr perot has said its time to clean out the barn and we had better listen the administrative cost of this body is very excessive and now we have an administration that is asking taxpayers to share the cost and share the pain of tax increases this body is no better than the american taxpayer we have to consider their pain and their cost and substantially cut the cost of congress even if it is painful to some

of us recognise there are risks in freetrade agreements particularly with societies with lower standards of living but in the final measure free trade is a better answer to the worlds economic disequililbrtum than foreign aid shared economic hope is a more effective deterrent top war than competitive protectionism when it comes to advancing peace as well as prosperity big fences simply do not make good neighbors if there is any hope of countries and peoples coming to have shared values in a world of nuclear weapons and fractured group identities competition must be in trade not arms in markets not land masses nafta in this context is a step toward providing citizens of the globe a common selfinterest shared prosperity based on shared economic growth of all the major economic issues before congress nafta is a decision for which there are a large number of meritorious arguments on each aide there are certain risks involved in enacting nafta but my best judgment at thispoint is that the aimrican economy especially the iowa economy will benefit in the long run from freer trade and that more jobs will be created than lost in the united states because of nafta my support for nafta in based partly on a look at the benefits of free trade throughout american history one of the lessons of t 19vs was that protectionist ltegislation such as the smoothawley tariff lengthened and deepened the great depression by reverse logic in recessionary times promotng policies that impel the growth of international trade is likely to serve as an economic sttnoulant trade barriers are particularly harmful to icmaas agrtealtualbased economy hence the importance of reginal agreements like nafta and the larger multicontinent gatt process lt cannot be stressed enough that defeat of na ta will preduce a double whammy for the iowa farmer loss of new markets south of our border and loss of the last vestiges of leverage for fairness in agricultural trade in the gatt discussions if nafta goes down the french would crow the contention on the continent would be that americans have no right to petition for fairer trade in agricultural commodities that is reduced subsidies if we refused to embrace free trade in our own hemisphere our farmers are the most productive in the world yet in the absence of international markets this very prodhctivity is the largest contributor to our excess supply problems what iowa farmers need is open markets abroad that are based on fair and equal trade this it also true for iowas manufac turing and services economy many companies with substantial capital investments in the first district like hon industries in muscatine expectto be able to create more iowa jobs because they will not only be subject to lower mexican tariffs but the dismantling over time of madenmexico product requirements some companies will always seek the lowest wage environment for this type of company mexico is more attractive without than with nafta because mexico will not have to adjust its labor or environmental standards and will be able to keep in place discriminatory tariffs with or without nafta some jobs will flow to mexico with nafta more new jobs are likely to be created is the united states than would otherwise be the case several years ago the united states established a freetrade agreement with canada in advance of the agreemeat most economists suggested it would be good for the united states and even better for canada in retrospect the agreement has proven good for canada and even better for the united state canada which had very high tariffs on united states goods has bee required to drop far more trade barriers than the united states in this regard a like circumstance exists with mexico their tarifs are extremely high often s to 10 times higher than very modest unitedstates ones and their current nontarift barriers vat unitedstates companies in a competitively untenable posltion under nafta in exchange for assured asee to the united states and canadian markets the mexicans must give the moat os tarf and on accepting changes in their environmental and labor policies while freetrade arrangements with lowerwage societie holds particular risks for some co panies midwesten farmers as well as farm implement food processing and trucking companies centered in cities like cedar rapids and the quad cities should be benefited and it must be empha esd without nafta united states cotpanies are free to invest in mexico all nafta does is lower already low barriers to mexican imports and in exchange lower what are substantially higher barriers to united states exports to mexico the most risky aspect of the agreement relates to the significant wage differential in mexico this could pose a problem in some industries but it should be stressed the same problem exists without an agreement one protection for us that seldom is noted is that the effect of an agreement can be measured over time and either party will retain the right to withdraw if it does not prove fair here those of us who are fortunate enough to live north of the rio grands must understand that when opportunity and hope are lacking at home individuals will make the obvious decision they vote with their feet for a better life president salinas is neither exaggerating nor threatening when he suggests the choice for america is whether we want more mexican products or more mexican people another factor of interest is that the asian countries which unlike mexico have developed an enormous trade surplus with the united states in recent years radically oppose the agreement they conjecture taht a partnership of countries of north america will cause more job creation hereand a rower reliance on imports from asia economists point out for instance that when the united states imports a finished product from the far east almost all the component parts are manufactured in the far east in mexico the reverse is the case a growing jobs base in mexico can potentially impel a growing jobs base in the united states as mexican buying power increases so will mexican demand for united states goodsa likewise our european competitors are very apprehenive of nafta because they fear they will be boxed out of the mexican market because they will be forced to pay tariffs that united states firma will not one cedar rapids company for instance4 tells me they expect to be in a positton to replace a european companys current dqnzinance of the mexican market for agricultural byproducts finally two notes about the democratic process first critics of nafta are right to be upset with the tactics of the admistratiox bi ledging other peoples noneythat is taxpayer dollars to influence votes for instance however meritorious establishment c a north american development ban might be in another context i voted i committee against establishing such mechanism as part of the naft agreement because i considered i grossly unseemly to advance a mult million dollar spending program just t influence a few votes to fvor naft people can credibly be for or agalng nafta but positions should be base on principle not promises of program in a more positive se it is inte eating perhaps profoundly so that a important policy identified with a 11 ting president should be supported i the majority by the party that has tb greatest interest in seeing the pm dent not succeed while less thean 4 percent of the presidents own party i expected to vote for the oston advt cated by their leader whatevr tb merits of nafta and

of us recognise there are risks in freetrade agreements particularly with societies with lower standards of living but in the final measure free trade is a better answer to the worlds economic disequililbrtum than foreign aid shared economic hope is a more effective deterrent top war than competitive protectionism when it comes to advancing peace as well as prosperity big fences simply do not make good neighbors if there is any hope of countries and peoples coming to have shared values in a world of nuclear weapons and fractured group identities competition must be in trade not arms in markets not land masses nafta in this context is a step toward providing citizens of the globe a common selfinterest shared prosperity based on shared economic growth of all the major economic issues before congress nafta is a decision for which there are a large number of meritorious arguments on each aide there are certain risks involved in enacting nafta but my best judgment at thispoint is that the aimrican economy especially the iowa economy will benefit in the long run from freer trade and that more jobs will be created than lost in the united states because of nafta my support for nafta in based partly on a look at the benefits of free trade throughout american history one of the lessons of t 19vs was that protectionist ltegislation such as the smoothawley tariff lengthened and deepened the great depression by reverse logic in recessionary times promotng policies that impel the growth of international trade is likely to serve as an economic sttnoulant trade barriers are particularly harmful to icmaas agrtealtualbased economy hence the importance of reginal agreements like nafta and the larger multicontinent gatt process lt cannot be stressed enough that defeat of na ta will preduce a double whammy for the iowa farmer loss of new markets south of our border and loss of the last vestiges of leverage for fairness in agricultural trade in the gatt discussions if nafta goes down the french would crow the contention on the continent would be that americans have no right to petition for fairer trade in agricultural commodities that is reduced subsidies if we refused to embrace free trade in our own hemisphere our farmers are the most productive in the world yet in the absence of international markets this very prodhctivity is the largest contributor to our excess supply problems what iowa farmers need is open markets abroad that are based on fair and equal trade this it also true for iowas manufac turing and services economy many companies with substantial capital investments in the first district like hon industries in muscatine expectto be able to create more iowa jobs because they will not only be subject to lower mexican tariffs but the dismantling over time of madenmexico product requirements some companies will always seek the lowest wage environment for this type of company mexico is more attractive without than with nafta because mexico will not have to adjust its labor or environmental standards and will be able to keep in place discriminatory tariffs with or without nafta some jobs will flow to mexico with nafta more new jobs are likely to be created is the united states than would otherwise be the case several years ago the united states established a freetrade agreement with canada in advance of the agreemeat most economists suggested it would be good for the united states and even better for canada in retrospect the agreement has proven good for canada and even better for the united state canada which had very high tariffs on united states goods has bee required to drop far more trade barriers than the united states in this regard a like circumstance exists with mexico their tarifs are extremely high often s to 10 times higher than very modest unitedstates ones and their current nontarift barriers vat unitedstates companies in a competitively untenable posltion under nafta in exchange for assured asee to the united states and canadian markets the mexicans must give the moat os tarf and on accepting changes in their environmental and labor policies while freetrade arrangements with lowerwage societie holds particular risks for some co panies midwesten farmers as well as farm implement food processing and trucking companies centered in cities like cedar rapids and the quad cities should be benefited and it must be empha esd without nafta united states cotpanies are free to invest in mexico all nafta does is lower already low barriers to mexican imports and in exchange lower what are substantially higher barriers to united states exports to mexico the most risky aspect of the agreement relates to the significant wage differential in mexico this could pose a problem in some industries but it should be stressed the same problem exists without an agreement one protection for us that seldom is noted is that the effect of an agreement can be measured over time and either party will retain the right to withdraw if it does not prove fair here those of us who are fortunate enough to live north of the rio grands must understand that when opportunity and hope are lacking at home individuals will make the obvious decision they vote with their feet for a better life president salinas is neither exaggerating nor threatening when he suggests the choice for america is whether we want more mexican products or more mexican people another factor of interest is that the asian countries which unlike mexico have developed an enormous trade surplus with the united states in recent years radically oppose the agreement they conjecture taht a partnership of countries of north america will cause more job creation hereand a rower reliance on imports from asia economists point out for instance that when the united states imports a finished product from the far east almost all the component parts are manufactured in the far east in mexico the reverse is the case a growing jobs base in mexico can potentially impel a growing jobs base in the united states as mexican buying power increases so will mexican demand for united states goodsa likewise our european competitors are very apprehenive of nafta because they fear they will be boxed out of the mexican market because they will be forced to pay tariffs that united states firma will not one cedar rapids company for instance4 tells me they expect to be in a positton to replace a european companys current dqnzinance of the mexican market for agricultural byproducts finally two notes about the
