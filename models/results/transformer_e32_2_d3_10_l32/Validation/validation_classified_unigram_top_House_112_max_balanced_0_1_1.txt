plan so we say to the republicans well whats your plan your plan just seems to be saying to grandma and grandpa that theyre taking too much that they reallytheyre taking america for a ride and we have to cut medicare their health care is too good and grandma and grandpa they didnt do enough for america so the democrats we turn around and say hey how about looking at it this way how about before you go after grandma and her medicare card and how about you say to warren buffet hey how about not taking those extra tax breaks and the republicans say we cant take away any tax breaks from warren buffet and all of the other multimultimillionaires and billionaires because theyve contributed so much to america we dont want to touch their money even though that would give us hundreds of billions of dollars and then we say to them well how about prescription drugs how about we negotiate the price for prescription drugs for medicare the way we do with the va that would save about a quarter of a trillion dollars over a 10year period they say that would be unfair to the drug companies we cant touch them either then we say to them well you know the war in iraq the war in afghanistan its winding down now maybe we could look into the defense budget and save a few billion dollars there before we ask grandma to sacrifice on the health care that she gets from medicare and the republicans say we cant do that either we cant look at any cuts in the defense budget that would be much too hard on those defense contractors so then we say to them how about the oil industry at least the oil industry the 40 billion in tax breaks which theyre going to get over the next 10 years i mean does anyone in america really believe that they need tax breaks in order to have an incentive to go out and drill for oil when people are paying 3 3 50 4 a gallon at the pump but the republicans say no you cant touch the oil companies either youve got to give big tax breaks to the oil industry as well even as theyre tipping grandma and grandpa upside down at the pump when theyre coming in to put in their unleaded 4 a gallon gasolineselfserve by the wayat the pump so what do they do instead what they do is they put an oil rig on top of the medicare card so that the oil industry can drill into grandmas medicare and pull out the funding in order to provide the tax breaks for big oil for warren buffet for the prescription drug industry for the wars in iraq and afghanistan its all off of grandma shes the one weve targeted the person responsible for all of the wasteful spending in the united states its all grandmas fault lets cut medicare she didnt do enough to build our country through the 1930s the 1940s the 1950s and the 1960s its all on grandma so this drill rig that they are building into the pocketbooks of grandma in order to find that funding thats what their plan is all about its an oil pipeline into the pocketbooks of the seniors they want to cut checkups for grandma while they cut checks for the oil companies they want to cut health care to grandma and give wealth care to big oil companies and to billionaires and to prescription drug companies their plan is big tax breaks for big oil and tough breaks for grandma and for the seniors in our country and the ceo of chevron he says its unamerican to think about increasing taxes on the oil industry you know what i say to him its unbelievable that you could make that argument but even more unbelievable that the republican party would accept that argument and cut medicare for grandma to privatize it to hand it over to the insurance industry to increase the cost by 6 000 per year for their costs even as they say to warren buffet the oil companies the big drug companies the arms contractors dont worry were going to protect your programs its just grandma thats on the cutting block so ladies and gentlemen this is a debate of historical dimensions and until the republicans come forward with a planwhich they dont have in order to make medicare solventby raising the revenues out of these other areas from millionaires from the oil industry and from others do not expect us to say to grandma its her fault its not her fault she built this country she deserves this benefit and we should not be cutting it this republican plan to end medicare is just something that wants to turn it over to the insurance industry

our shared values from world war ii to 9 11 to hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and those who are less fortunate thats never been an american value i urge my colleagues to reject this ruse to reject the reconciliation process and to work toward a comprehensive and responsible and bipartisan deficit agreement reflective of our nations

companies from denying coverage for preexisting conditions and by eliminating the annual and lifetime caps on coverage found in most current policies the affordable care act will guarantee that middle

some of my colleagues on the democratic side of the budget committee to talk about choices you know government is all about choosing it is setting priorities and it is choosing what we are going to spend the peoples money for how much we are going to ask the people to pay to the government and how we are going to spend those dollars it is all about choosing it is also about values this week this issue of choices is playing itself out in two arenas in government one in the continuing resolution battle that took place on this floor this afternoon the idea that we have to figure out how to fund the government for the rest of this fiscal year ending september 30 and whether or not we are willing to let the government shut down tomorrow night because of the choices that we either make or refuse to make and it is also playing itself out now in the development of the budget for the following fiscal year yesterday in the budget committee we considered the budget proposal offered by chairman ryan and the republicans that offered some very stark choices for the american people they are similar to the choices that we have been debating week after week after week for the last couple of months about how we are going to fund the government for the rest of the year from the democratic perspective at least i know from my perspective the reason i have not been willing to support the republican versions of the continuing resolutions that have come to this floor is that they make choices which dont seem very fair to me they dont seem to represent the values that this country has always embraced the values of fairness and justice and the idea that we are all in this great journey together and that we are trying to create a country that works for everybody and not just for a very few today the republicans brought to the floor a continuing resolution to fund the government for one more week these are the choices they made as to what we should cut in order to avoid shutting the government down they wanted to eliminate 143 million for school lunch assistance programs 187 million for education for the disadvantaged programs school improvement funds education innovative improvement programs and adult education it cuts the wic program nutrition for lowincome families women and their children the office of national drug control policy they want to cut 495 million from femas first responder program all these things they wanted to cut and yet when you ask them whether they want to have other people the wealthiest people the big corporations the people who have done very well in this country over the last couple of decades if you ask them why dont we make them share some of the burden of balancing this budget they say oh no we cant do that we cant do that let me just illustrate with this chart one of the choices that they made in the 2012 budget proposal they chose to include refused to eliminate 800 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans and instead cut 771 billion from medicaid over the next 10 years this was a choice do we want to make sure that our senior citizens have access to nursing homes that our disabled population has access to assisted living facilities and home care our young lowincome poor families do we want to make sure that they have health care or do we want to make sure that the wealthiest 2 percent of americans continue to have their cake and eat it too their choice in the budget and in the continuing resolution is to let those wealthiest americans have their cake and eat it too and let the most vulnerable segments of society pay the price of helping to balance the budget i am a big fan of political cartoons and todays cartoon in the washington post i think said it all because one of the other proposals that the republicans made in their 2012 budget proposal was not just to maintain the tax breaks for the wealthiest americans but to increase them they want to cut the maximum tax rate from 35 percent which was the rate that it was cut to by the bush administration they wanted to cut it even further to 25 percent in other words a 10 percent additional tax cut for the wealthiest americans as a matter of fact i offered an amendment in the hearing to rescind the bush tax cut for only those people making over 1 million a year only those people making over 1 million a year they voted it down unanimously but here is the cartoon by tom toles in the washington post it has and i wont name him but a republican member of the budget committee offering a platter that says more tax cuts for wealthy and the truly rich guy says stop i cant eat another bite and the republican says sorry everybody has to share the pain this is one of the choices we have it is stark again tax cuts for the wealthiest americans or health care education nutrition for the other 90 percent of the american people who have not done so well so as we move through this process of choosing both how we are going to fund the government until september 30 and how were going to fund it into the future the american people need to know whose side the republican majority is on and whose side the democrats are

missouri for his efforts in working not just in his time as chairman but working with the committee in the previous years and i know that he understands that this is not a republican or a democratic problem because the regulatory burdens on small businesses increased by 30 billion from the years 20012008 and federal regulations now cost americans 1 75 trillion each year which is up 50 percent from the 1 1 trillion in annual costs just in 2005 and last year the federal register contained 80 000 pages in its first year in print the federal register contained 2 355 pages and each year federal agencies continue to release thousands of pages of new regulations and accompanying information and i know that the gentleman understands that and we share the goal of reducing this burden because the burden is detrimental and it affects small businesses in fact studies indicate that adhering to federal rules cost 10 585 per worker for small businesses with 19 or fewer workers but only 78 percent of that amount for businesses with 500plus workers it affects small businesses disproportionately overall on a peremployee basis it costs 2 400 or 45 percent more for small businesses to comply with federal regulations than their larger counterparts small businesses face the greatest disadvantage in complying with environmental and tax regulations compliance with environmental regulations cost 364 percent more in small firms than large and 67 percent more for the cost of corporate tax compliance so we agree on the problem the question is where do we go from here and this is where i have a concern with what chairman graves is putting forward what does h res 72 call for that were not already doing the committee on small business has been reviewing regulations in a bipartisan fashion for years the gentleman has been involved in that and as a result of these examinations its called on federal agencies to modify or alter regulatory requirements that impose costs on small firms this has included regulations pertaining to medical equipment at cms accounting requirements at the sec real estate procedures at hud environmental regulations at the epa and on it goes so the reality is weve already done as a committee what this resolution calls for and i will include in the record the 112th congress small business committees oversight of federal regulatory and paperwork burdens administrative plan what the committee has already passed so my question for the gentleman from missouri to answer during the course of the debate is what exactly does this resolution do for small businesses that were not already doing is there anything in this thats not already being done now does it actually reduce any real regulatory burden on small businesses does it reduce paperwork does it limit government requirements on the small business community i would submit that this particular resolution does not it sets up a bureaucratic process here in the congress with a goal of inventory of regulations a long list of inventory regulations but this list will be submitted as part of an administrative reporting process it does nothing for small businesses so i would suggest in closing that instead of approving this bookkeeping resolution what congress really needs to do is strengthen the tools it already has available to reduce regulatory burdens this includes the regulatory flexibility act which mandates that federal agencies consider the potential economic impact of federal regulations strengthening the requirements and increasing agency reviews and regulations regulatory relief that we passed here in the congress during the 110th congress reported out by the small business committee related to bipartisan regulatory reductions and as we continue to revisit these issues here in the 112th congress we must remember that small businesses are who were trying to help so in closing im concerned that what this legislation does is add an unnecessary step to getting down to the business that we can all agree on which is actually reducing the regulations that we all agree are a problem"], [0.993771243840456, 0.006228756159543991, 1, "staff was and

the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has jurisdiction that includes arizona but goes up to the new mexico border and so when illegals cross into the united states near new mexico or arizona some of them ask the question am i in the 9th court which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first obligationto protect americans and thats just the way it is"], [0.9933729371987283, 0.006627062801271677, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in strong

internationally recognized borders which includes abkhazia and south ossetia as regions of georgia it is time for russia to remove its occupying forces from abkhazia and south ossetia and comply fully with the august 12 2008 ceasefire agreement it is also time for the russian federation venezuela nicaragua tuvalu and nauru to revoke their recognition of the georgian regions as independent states

revolution the reforms needed to strengthen georgias nascent democracy are wellknown an independent judiciary respect for human rights and the rule of law a vibrant civil society independent media accountable and transparent policymaking and a balance of power between the executive and legislative branches these reforms will be the strongest guarantor of georgias independence and prosperity

backwards would not only be a blow to the development of georgias democracy but ultimately to its independence there have been some disturbing reports concerning efforts to prevent some political

should as soon as we can this suggests that we can leave by the end of the year if we dont well be there for another decade would be my prediction the american people are now with us a group of us here in the congress a bipartisan group for nearly a decade have been talking about this arguing not to expand the war not to be over there not to be in nation building and the american people didnt pay much attention now they are the large majority of the american people now say its time to get out of afghanistan its a fruitless venture too much has been lost the chance of winning since we dont even know what we are going to win doesnt exist so they are tired of it financially theres a good reason to come home as well some argue we have to be there because if we leave under these circumstances well lose face it will look embarrassing to leave so how many more men and women have to die how many more dollars have to be spent to save face that is one of the worst arguments possible we are not there under legal conditions this is a war who says it isnt a war everybody talks about the afghan war was the war declared of course not it wasnt declared there was a resolution passed that said that the president at that time under the emergency of 9 11 could go and deal with al qaeda those who brought upon the 9 11 bombings but al qaeda is not there anymore so we are fighting the taliban the taliban used to be our allies at one time when the soviets were there the talibans main goal is to keep the foreign occupation out they want foreigners out of their country they are not al qaeda yet most americansmaybe less so now but the argument here on the floor is we have got to go after al qaeda this is not a war against al qaeda if anything it gives the incentive for al qaeda to grow in numbers rather than dealing with them the money issue we are talking about a lot of money how much do we spend a year probably about 130 billion up to 1 trillion now in this past decade later on in the day we are going to have two votes we are going to have a vote on doing something sensible making sense out of our foreign policy bringing our troops home and saving hundreds of billions of dollars then we also will have a vote against npr to cut the funding of npr there is a serious question about whether that will even cut one penny but at least the fiscal conservatives are going to be overwhelmingly in support of slashing npr and then go home and brag about how they are such great fiscal conservatives and the very most they might save is 10 million and thats their claim to fame for slashing the budget at the same time they wont consider for a minute cutting a real significant amount of money all empires end for fiscal reasons because they spread themselves too far around the world and thats what we are facing we are in the midst of a military conflict that is contributing to this inevitable crisis and its financial and you would think there would be a message there how did the soviets come down by doing the very same thing that were doing perpetual occupation of a country we dont need to be occupying afghanistan or any other country we dont even need to be considering going into libya or anywhere else fortunately i guess for those of us who would like to see less of this killing we will have to quit because we wont be able to afford it the process that we are going through is following the war powers resolution this is a proper procedure it calls attention to how we slip into these wars i have always claimed that its the way we get into the wars that is the problem if we would be precise and only go to war with a declaration of war with the people behind us knowing who the enemy is and fight win and get it over with that would be more legitimate they dont do it now because the american people wouldnt support it nobody is going to declare war against afghanistan or iraq or libya we now have been so careless for the past 50 or 60 years that as a congress and especially as a house we have reneged on our responsibilities we have avoided our prerogatives of saying that we have the control we have control of the purse we have control of when we are supposed to go to war yet the wars continue they never stop and we are going to be completely brought down to our knees we cant change afghanistan the people who

a more than 70 percent majority say people making more than 1 million a year should contribute to what the problems are in this country so that fell apart then we had the gang of 6 senatorsthree republicans three democratswho had been on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the deaths in america preventive care would be reined in it would slash block grant funding in the united states to help 23 million children seniors and disabled americans live independently and out of poverty no segment of the population is immune from this painful absurd republican planexcept maybe millionaires billionaires and wealthy corporations the republican proposal cuts meals on wheels and reduces food assistance for almost 2 million needy people one of the republican candidates running for president said president obama is the food stamp president there are more poor people our economy has been in bad shape people are struggling the millionaires are doing fine and in addition to what i have already mentioned this thing that they are taking up in the house today cuts off almost 300 000 children from free school lunches at a time when one in five children lives in poverty the unitedstates conference of catholic bishops said the republican plan fails a basic moral test this budget sets very clear priorities the problem is what they are taking up in the house sets up the wrong priorities president franklin roosevelt said human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened

no drydock capability to allow private sectors to invest huge monies or to come back here later after we get the authorization to say we want more money from congress to appropriate there would not be appropriate because as the gentlelady from hawaii said we already have sufficient capacity both in pearl harbor in washington in california and in guam and to show that there are no requirements for this further ship repair capacity in the pacific region you can just look at last year where the absence of need was perhaps best exemplified by the fact that the navy only received one bid when it had a proposal from shipyards in the pacific region for a longterm operating lease for the guam ship repair facility property and that bid was from the current guam shipyard operator the distance from overseas home ports and from the regions in which the msc ships operates makes a shipyard in the mariana islands prohibitive in terms of operating costs to and from there so i hope that congress will not go down this line at this particular point in time the navy has absolutely no additional requirements or needs that they have for this particular yard there we are struggling at this particular

attributed to our goal of cleaner air for that reason i have remained hopeful that epas administrative air permitting barriers to exploring alaskas outer continental shelf would be addressed but they havent as such we continue to see air permits for offshore exploration wells perpetually go back and forth between the producer the epa the environmental appeals board with no movement towards a final decision thats why i am an original cosponsor of the jobs and energy permitting act which would rectify several of those process questions so that we can safely and responsibly produce our natural resources in the arctic ocean the epa needs to have a permit approval system in place that is predictable workable and understandable when i hear that in the last 5 years shell has drilled over 400 exploration wells worldwide while waiting for one single permit for alaska somethings definitely wrong with the process while the opponents of this legislation are saying that this bill guts the clean air act thats just not true because all this bill does is match epas outer continental shelf permitting process with the air permitting process employed by the department of the interior in the gulf

where activity typically only lasts for a few days not production wells where activities last for months i have long been a supporter of safe and responsible drilling on the outer continental shelf as these resources are a vital source of energy for the united states with skyrocketing fuel costs it is imperative for the unitedstates to diversify our energy sources by exploring this area and this

amendment and i want to restate what it attempts to do it will prohibit outsourcing of dod functions until the secretary of defense conducts an outreach program to benefit women and minorityowned small businesses well in fact it is a duplication of what is already in the law it duplicates section 891 of the fiscal year 2011 national defense authorization act which requires the establishment of an outreach program to firms near dod installations this act simply delays allowing for outsourcing to come back in and be part of the benefits that it provides to this nation reducing cost streamlining the process so again this is already in law as i said this is nothing more than a delay tactic to stop outsourcing we need to use outsourcing where it makes sense to utilize the benefits of reducing cost which has the potential to help our small businesses which i think we all support whether they are womenowned or minorityowned businesses small businesses are important and i think outsourcing does that in fact in my district letterkenny army depot has publicprivate partnerships today through outsourcing with small businesses and large alike the heritage foundation did a study commending what is going on at letterkenny army depot utilizing dod civilians as well as the private sector coming together where it makes sense where we can have a tremendously positive impact on the work that goes there so there is a model out there and outsourcing is important again i urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment because again it already is established in last years defense

language which this amendment tries to strike it simply tells the secretary of usda to notify the committee of any trips related to the know your farmer initiative and include the agenda and the cost to the american taxpayers it doesnt prevent them from doing this it simply says let us know it also says put this information on the web page so if know your farmer is that important why would usda have any opposition to this at all in fact i dont know that usda does i also want to say that as somebody who represents rural southeast georgia there is this nostalgic idea that somehow the further food travels the more evil it becomes but if you look at a plate of fresh vegetables that you may have eaten sometime today that food traveled a long way in fact asparagus travels a long way lettucemy friend mr farr gave me an article earlier today i think 59 percent of the lettuce in america comes from his one district now if we start confining that to monterey county it might be great for the folks in monterey county but i dont mind eating california lettuce because if the california farmers can do it for less money and i can get lettuce year round for less money thats not a bad thing so i think some of the assumption that food traveling is a bad idea i think its flawed in itself but i want to get back to this bill report language it simply says to the usda let us know how much youre going to spend and why is that so important i want my friend from california to know that if you look through the usda budget request for fy12 theres not one mention of know your farmerknow your food its an initiative there has not been a budget request for it if there was a budget request for it for 3 million or 30 million then we could have something we could be debating about but what it is is an initiative and all were asking is if you go forward with thisand we dont stop them from going forward with itwere just saying we want to know how much its going to cost so i do not believe that its
