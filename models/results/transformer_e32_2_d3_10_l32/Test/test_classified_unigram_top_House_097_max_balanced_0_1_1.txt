offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.0019016861915588379, 0.9980983138084412, 1, "i would only allude to a few comments admiral laroche of the center for defense information quoted lord mountbatten the brilliant british military person who said in 1979 i have come to the conclusion that nuclear weapons are not military weapons because nuclear weapons cannot be used and the danger that imperils humankind on the face of this earth is the perception the illusion that nuclear weapons can be used to me this was an eloquent and powerful statement that nuclear weapons are never to be used but only for deterrence but the supporting documents for this military budget fiscal year 1983 say we must have the capacity to fight to survive and win a nuclear war anyone who believes we can fight survive and win a nuclear war bydefinition with all due respect is psychotic every analyst i have seen indicates that no one wins in a nuclear war there is no such as a limited war a surgical strike where 20 to 100 million human beings are dead what is limited and surgical about that i would quote dr geiger the executive director of the physicians for social responsibility who said as i look at the united states and the soviet union and their nuclear arms race i think of two men and i think that is appropriate because it is very sexist and macho to play war gamestwo men in a room locked tight up to their throats in gasoline one standing there with 10 matches and the other standing there with 7 matches and they are both arguing over whether they need 15 matches apiece before they can agree not to strike 1 match in that room that is where we are that is precisely where this arms race is millions of the american people are beginning to awaken to the reality that nuclear war is insanity bloated wasteful and unnecessary military budgets are not in our best interests finally my colleagues are talking about a 5percent addon for fiscal year 1983 military budget as if these numbers make some sense the point is that fiscal year 1982 was an incredibly high base in fiscal year 1981 the military budget in budget authority terms was 173 billion in fiscal year 1982 it went up to 226 billion 25 percent over and above that is incredible we must remember that ronald reagan stomped us in 1982 and put the military budget at an incredible level so let me give the members these figures because it also includes the black caucus budget when you go back to 1981 as a base 1982 which was terribly out of line the jones budget if we use 1981 figures calls for 32 9percent increase in 2 years the aspin budget in 2 years calls for a 31 3percent increase the latta budget 33 4percent increase in the military budget in 2 years the obey budget 30 6 percent and even this socalled radical document known as the congressional black caucus that budget is still 25 percent over and above fiscal year 1981 a 12 5 average increase in 2 years so yoticannot tell me or any other rational human being that we are not pouring an incredible amount of money in our military budget in conclusion i would simply say think analyze evaluate and debate let us not reduce ourselves to some hucksters and hustlers and auctioneers here we are thinking human beings committed to establishing policy lot us stop the madness of nuclear war and this everincreasing military budget i join all my colleagues in that struggle"], [0.001933753490447998, 0.998066246509552, 1, "first of all i would like to commend congressman wyche fowler for providing the time for this much needed discussion of a very critical issue the slaying of over 20 children in atlanta ga is clearly indicative of the sickness which is eroding the fibers of our society violence is becoming more and more a way of life throughout our nation the atlanta slayings and related attacks against children are very cogent symbols that we are moving further away from the highest regard for human life it frightens me deeply to acknowledge the significant psychological damage which is growing among all children due to the recent incidences while the victims of these murders have all been black it is no secret that such acts of violence do not discriminate the fundamental question we must face now is that any child may be forced to live in fear during every phase of a days activity surely the increased number of weaponcarrying schoolchildren momentary periods of panic if a parent is late picking up a schoolchild and decrease in academic achievement are not peculiar to the findings of several atlanta psychiatrists psychologists and mental health officials the feelings of distrust fear and apprehension wih spread among all of our nations children as they begin ti dread functioning in everyday environments this is a sad outlook for our future another fundamental question which is magnifici in the minds of those who fear for human safety is the continuing focus away from human needs we are forced now to question if whether or not the evils of poverty deprivation and unemployment may be so deep rooted in our society that respect for human life becomes secondary to mere survival we are also forced to question the validity of continuous violence as romanticized and glamourized on our television and movie screens the situations in georgia florida maryland and throughout most regions in this country leave us frustrated and angry they leave us to question the basic responsiveness of authorities who must become more adamant in the protection of human lives however they must not lead us to take the law into our own hands the widespread acts of violence must also remind us that the protection and preservation of human lives are crossjurisdictional when as many as 21 lives are lost it cannot be pegged as a state or local government matter both the president and the congress realized this and i laud the dispersal of federal funds to atlanta and the efforts to appropriate 1 5 and 1 8 million for use by this city we have to examine closely the cli mate that motivates and encourages psychotic violence the violence of racism the aforementioned influence of television and movies and the violence of war and militarismall of these inevitably get reflected in individual behavior to a greater or lesser degree he psychotic killers who murder our children in atlanta or any where else are victims of this climate and have apparently been affected to a greater degree we cannot excuse this behavior however we can and must deal squarely with the environment which fosters such actions several sociologists tell us that most of the slain atlanta children come from public housing neighborhoods which are more vulnerable and conducive to human mistreatment abduction and even death such conditions and incidences are not limited to this region of the country right here in washington d c children from lowincome housing projects are becoming more and more susceptible to conditions of drug abuse and molestation here the elimination of unemployment underemployment and poverty must precede the eradication of such criminal acts it is not easy to warn the blacks of atlanta to stay away from theories that the acts of violence against 21 black children are conspiratorial in nature or racially motivated the pattern of systematic murders rapes additional overt and covert actions against black citizens in the south and throughout this country is still just too prevalent however we must assist in the efforts of mayor maynard jackson the numerous task forces and concerned cftizens in addressing the problem in a rational way again until we eliminate the fundamental societal ills we cannot be shocked at deviant behavioral patterns of violence irresponsibility and total disregard for human lives there is little help in calling on citizens to care about each other when increasing inequities among neighborhoods schools living standards and opportunities have become a way of life those of us who are in a position to have impact on public policy must stand firm against further inequities and burdens on our children elderly and lowincome citizens we must promote the kind of solidarity which has been displayed as citizens across the nation have rallied behind the victimized atlanta families most importantly we must not be afraid to oppose and openly attack racism chronic unemployment poverty injustice and other societal ills which cloud any efforts to provide equal opportunities

dedicated to law he has served as a special agent in the fbi as an assistant unitedstates attorney and as a member of the judiciary committee in the unitedstates congress california state senate and california assembly prior to his public service george was engaged in the vigorous private practice of law upon entering the congress in 1971 georgeas a freshmanbecame a member of the house leadership in the whips office he was also a major participant in the house impeachment proceedings during the judiciary committees review of watergate during these hearings george became prominent in his role in developing meticulous legal points regarding violations of the law and constitution since he had such a keen mastery of the law he was an extremely valuable participant and was very strong on relevant questioning of witnesses during the impeachment proceedings georges marvelous sense of humor and penchant for colorful quotes to the local and national press became apparent for example during a heated interrogation of an evasive watergate witness george was widely quoted for his comment that eliciting a response was like trying to nail a drop of water to the wall while undergoing more serious questioning of another watergate witness george demonstrated his great talent for thinking on his feet and quickly getting to the point at that time president nixons counsel protested that the impeachment hearings were damaging to the presidency george replied that only the president can damage the office of the president what we are doing is protecting the office of the president during his service in the house george has achieved numerous legislative victories these include the ethics in governnlient act copyright reform bankruptcy legislation and his involvement in performers royalties legislation additionally george has been a key leader in numerous administrative procedures legislation dealing with the improved functioning of government additionally many of us are well aware of his exceptional performance as presiding officer in the house speaker oneill frequently calls upon george to preside over this body and we have all noted georges fair and efficient manner in conducting this important duty numerous press accounts have referred to george as a workhorse a trait that all of us who have been privileged to work with him have noted repeatedly george spends tremendous energy and time on hi legislative and constituent duties and has justly received many accolades for his efforts just recently for example president reagan signed into law legislation which previously had appeared before georges subcommittee on administrative law and governmental relations this federal tort claims measure was signed hito law in december of last year and when presenting george with the pen president reagan highly praised georges exemplary leadership and paid high tribute to his chairmanship abilities georges persuasive powers and negotiating abilities have been widely praised not only in washington but during his legislative service in sacramento as well during the tenure of governor reagan in california george had the incredible ability to persuade governor reagan to sign into law danielson bills after personal discussions regarding their merits this occasion was repeated numerous times each time with governor reagan signing into law measures which had expected to receive a quic reagan veto one of georges endeavors in the congress has been is personal and dedicated interest in the analyses of house rolleall votes after undertaking an extensive review over a 4year time period george concluded in a comprehensive report that the house was being inundated with unnecessary rollcalls resulting in a waste of house time and taxpayers money this report which was the subject of a syndicated column appearing in newsday and numerous newspapers received w de praise a brief reference accompanying the newsday article referred to george

defense by putting all this emphasis and huge expenditure into nuclear weapons in fact we are denuding not only our colleges and universities of professors in the sciences and engineering we are also at the present time already without this huge buildup creating shortages through our defense program in our industrial base on which we depend to produce weapons and on which we ri pend to try to keep an industrial base that can support a sound defense we are even injuring the military itself because so much of the military budget is going into nuclear weapons and nuclear delivery systems that we have not got adequate funds to be able to strengthen our conventional force to train our personnel so that they can operate the military equipment we were embarrassed not too long ago by having an initiative to try to recaputure our iranian hostages which went bad because we could not keep the helicopters flying i think increasingly we are going to see this with tle sophisticated technology we have ve have to give greater incentives to get qualified people into the military and to keep them in the military i have advocated a program which would give educational benefits very much like we do now at west point and the other military academies in return for people having an obligation of service for a period of time and obviously there is that critical need but we have not got money enough for that now i think from every aspect we are undermining our security by proposing to spend these trillions of dollars in nuclear weaponry there is another aspect of this that i would like to emphasize and then i will put the rest of my remarks in the record and that is the question of proliferation that also endangers our future and the future destruction of humanity i am very disturbed indeed that this administration is dropping the efforts that have been put together by all previous administrations republican and democratic to keep a curb on the weapons gaining capability of other countries who are not already nuclear weapons countries i think we need much greater effort internationally and in our own domain to end a fast growing proliferation which in many ways in more dangerous than the nuclear weapons race between ourselves and the russians i think it is highly unlikely that the russians are going to drop bombs on us knowing that they would be committing suicide in doing so they would be destroyed but if we allow reprocessing and enrichment in breeder technology to go around the world with plutonium and highly enriched uranium therefore very greatly available and not subject to effective controls we run the risk that a quadhafi in libya or an araot in the palestinian liberation organization or the red brigades in italy will gain control of a nuclear weapon and might be able to blackmail the world or anybody else and what is our response if the red brigades get a nuclear weapon you do not blow up italy the only real response is to assure that irre sponsible powers of that sort do not get access to nuclear weapons and nuclear materials from which weapons can readily be made today and yet this administration is not only dropping the previous administrations resistance to the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities the sale of reprocessing and enrichment and highly enriched uranium and breeder reactors abroad but we understand it is even being seriously considered that we would start selling reprocessed and enrichment material and equipment abroad ourselves and that we are even contemplating contaminating our civilian nuclear program by turning over spent fuel to be used for the production of weapons by our military forces i would like to say that if we proceed on that road i think we run just totally unacceptable risks that instead we ought to be calling an urgent international conference of nuclear weapons nations to try to restrict the further proliferation of nuclear weaponsmaking capability and the spread of plutonium and highly enriched uranium from which bombs can be made we ought to set up some kind of an international mechanism to assure countries that using fission reactors they would have an assured supply of lowenriched uranium we ought to put a tremendous effort into technology that the united states has developed to extend the lifetime and the burnup capability of existing fission reactors to do what we can to prohibit the sale to any other countries of the machines or the actual materials from which bombs can be made i think that this debate is exceedingly important again i congratulate its sponsors i am happy to take part in it to lend whatever efforts i can to have us stop saying nuclear policy overall and nuclear weapons policy in particular the reagan administrations stand accelerating the nuclear arms race is the crowning glory of a myriad of senseless destabilizing and dangerous policies it is thus especially gratifying to see so many americans finally rise up against this huge senseless nuclear arms buildup with its socalled tactical nuclear weapons neutron bombs and winnable nuclear wars and resist the administrations policies which are leading us on a course toward unprecedented nuclear calamity president reagan has initiated the most massive buildup of nuclear weapons in unitedstates history and on top of that an equally risky foray into develoying a new generation of chemical warfare weapons yet it has not even defined a coherent military or foreign policy the administration is planning a 6year 222 billion expansion of nuclear forces invulving land sea and airbased missiles space weaponry civil defense systems and more in the next decade reagans policies would add 17 000 new nuclear weapons to the 30 000 already existing in the unitedstates nuclear arsenal the stated purpose of this policy is to achieve the capacity to fight and win a nuclear wara goal as unattainable as it is dangerous the administration defends its buildup by claiming that we are vulnerable to the soviets in response to our repeated calls for priority efforts to control the development testing and deployment of nuclear weapons the administration has used distortions and inaccuracies to portray our present nuclear capability as inferior to the russians there is only one important fact in this equation howeverit is not comparability that matters but sufficiencyand we clearly have sufficient nuclear powerin fact the unitedstates has far more power than needed to destroy russia should it attackand russia knows it that is what mattersnot whethler we outnumber the russians or they us in particular weapons system even using the administrations comparisons however the united states and the soviet union are in rough parity today each possessing advantages and disadvantages in its nuclear weapons capability for example the united states leads the soviets by 9 400 deliverable strategic nuclear warheads to 7 800 according to the center for defense information moreover our warheads are more survivable because of more diverse unitedstates strategic force deployments despite the clear sufficiency and even advantage in strategic nuclear warheads possessed by the united states the administration has argued that the soviets are at an advantage in nuclear megatonnage but as paul warnke former director of the arms control and disarmament agency said in a recent interview which appeared in the new york times the fact that they might have a 2megaton warhead compared to our modest ones of something like 400 000 tons of tnt only makes one difference how big is the hole going to be where the high school used to be h 1260 again though all these comparisons are irrelevant we have more then enough power for our security already despite the incredible redundancy of nuclear weapons the reagan administration wants to continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars to fuel the arms race paralyzing our nations 1 the administrations continued development of more sophisticated nuclear weapons and delivery systems on this massive scale has created the impression that the united states is building a nuclear force to destroy the soviet unions nuclear arsenal in a preemptive attack as the united states and russia approach preemptive capabilities we both become much less secure requiring hairtrigger launch on warning policies enormous amounts of money will be spent and we will be less secure than ever as the military budget is absorbed by destabilizing nuclear weaponry really needed expenditures are denied for conventional forces spare parts improved pay and technical training for our military personnel we deny our soldiers sufficient education and training necessary to understand the tenets of military strategy and even how to operate the sophisticated weapons to which we entrust our national security thus again we will be less secure ever but the nuclear arms race is not the only problem risking nuclear destruction of humanity we need not only a freeze on nuclear weapons development but on the transfer of the materials and equipment for producing nuclear weapons the development of nuclear power on an international scale also carries with it the risk of increasing the number of countries that will have access to the technology and the materials for nuclear weapons specifically nuclear e richment and reprocessing facilities and breeder reactors are direct sources of bombquality materialshighly enriched uranium235 and plutonium if countries decide to use these facilities to develop nuclear weapons the rate of nuclear proliferation could increase and with it the chance of a provoked nuclear war or nuclear blackmail by terrorists against which there is no defense while we can deter russia from nuclear war by making it suicidal there would be no adequate response if a qadhafi or an araffat gains access to a nuclear bomb the only realistic recourse is to prevent terrorists from gaining access to weapons during the past decade the united states has expressed increasing concern over the proliferation risk assocated with nuclear power i one of the great ironies of reagans policies is that they will leave us much weakerweaker because of diversion of funds from our economly weaker because of the established nature of our nuclear investment and weaker because the billion to be spent on nuclear weapons will deprived our conventional military adequacy by 1985 25 nonweapon countries will have operational power reactors each generating enough spent fuel to manufacture a score of bombs annually if the plutonium is separated from the fuel more important some of these countries plan to build reprocessing facilities that will enable them to separate the plutonium from spent fuel once separated the plutonium could be put to weapons use quickly other countries have or are building enrichment plants that could be used to enrich uranium235 to bomb grade levels the reagan administration would greatly exacerbate this problem by condoning even promoting the intro duction and use of these sensitive nuclear technologies and materials on a commercial scale throughout the world once introduced they would be impossible to safeguard effectively providing too easy access to any terrorist group and nuclear weapons ca pability to countries that might use them for blackmail or in local conflicts if they got pressed to the wall the result could be incredible carnage in the late 20th century from the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries and the possibility of a third country provoking a nuclear war between the united states and russia the worlds most volatile regionsthe middle east and south asiaalready include five countries reported either to have the capability to construct nuclear weapons or to be actively seeking that capability in a worst case libya israel iraq pakistan and india could all have nuclear weapons within a few years the actions of these countries will not be independent of each other the nations are connected in a complicated fashion by enmity and cooperationthus the acquisition of nuclear weapons by one of these nations is likely to generate similar actions by others the region has suffered from major wars every few years the introduction of nuclear weapons into these wars could threaten millions of deaths in the region the destruction of the petroleum transportation facilities through which 40 percent of the western worlds oil must pass and the threat of annihilation of much of the worlds population through fallout or the provocation of wider nuclear conflict even the fear that one of these nations was attempting to acquire nuclear weapons could lead to armed conflict the iraqi nuclear program already has been the subject of assassinations and an air attack with conventional munitions of these five countries three of their governments came to power through internal military takeovers nuclear weapons in such internally unstable countries may not remain in the hands of the national governments subnational forces attempting a takeover are likely to try to seize the nuclear weapons sooner or later nuclear weapons or the material for their manufacture may fall into the hands of smaller military units or terrorists groups the middle east and south asia is the most dangerous region for nuclear proliferation in the near future but the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons reportedly has been sought by south africa south korea taiwan argentina and brazil and this is only the situation is the early 1980s the acquisition of nuclear weapons by one country is likely to lead to a chain reaction in which the enemies or rivals of that country then feel that they must acquire nuclear weapons some politicians in nigeria for example have already called for a nigerian weapons program aimed at the possibility that south africa will acquire nuclear weapons the same applies for syria visavis iraq proliferation need not stop with the acquisition of a few bombs of the type used by the united states against japan at the end of world war iiweapons that in the context of a small nuclear war could cause millions of deaths the next stop can be thermonuclear weaponsraising the death toll to tens of million of people or more or the next step may be long range delivery vehicles spreading the threat of nuclear destruction to nations far removed from the regional conflict in short proliferation is a major international security threat and it will certainly get worse if we do not take the lead with the other nuclear weapons powers to stop it for these reasons american policy has long featured a strong consensus opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons the reagan administration however is striving to undermine the good bipartisan unitedstates example set by previous presidents not only is mr reagan indifferent to the proliferation risks posed by civilian nuclear technology he has graphically illustrated that indifference by considering the use to make nuclear weapons of plutonium derived from spent fuel produced in civilian nuclear powerplants even worse he is considering for the first time in our history the export of sensitive reprocessing and enrichment technologies to nonnuclear weapons countries such exports would have tragic consequences and must not be permitted i intend soon to propose legislation to block mr reagans thoughtless move the united states simply must exercise its strongest leadership with its allies to prevent nuclear profits from overcoming the restraint necessary for nuclearage survival thankfully there are americans who are seeking to correct these irrational policies and to change our course away from nuclear devastation they recognize that nuclear war is not winable as this administration has claimed and they realize the danger in spending hundreds of billions of h 1262 co dollars on a massive nuclear weapons buildup without incorporating arms control and proliferation prevention into our national security policies i commend those who are resisting these senseless administration initiatives and i pledge my efforts to do all i can to see that congress does everything in its power to reverse those policies which come to us from the white house our efforts to stop this nuclear madness are essential if we are to

economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [0.002318263053894043, 0.997681736946106, 1, "the rules committee made in order h r 6696 an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the armed services committee bill back on january 29 of this year as i have indicated earlier on the floor i sent the chairperson of the armed services committee a communication suggesting that we expand the parameters of the discussion in the debate in the armed services committee in light of the fact that this administration has proposed a military budget in excess of 1 6 trillion in the first 5 years of the decade of the 1980s and with the fact that millions of american people and millions of people around the world are raising significant questions with respect to our lockedstep effort toward thermal nuclear war i felt that we had a profound obligation to go beyond the parameters of the armed services connittee to hear from other witnesses who had a positive and constructive alternative to our present military policies in this country and around the world the chair sent back a polite letter indicating that for a number of bureaucratic reasons they had an obligation to go forward with the military budget i understood that and responded to the chair by indicating that it was my belief that it is a moral imperative that we establish a platform to provide an opportunity for brilliant minds to come together to pose an alternative to americas present military and nuclear policy therefore in april of this year we held 6 days of hearings to look at the full implications of the military budget we looked at the national security and foreign policy implications of the military budget the tactical and strategic implications of the military budget and arms escalation versus arms control we looked at the economic implications and the moral implications of the military budget we looked at the economic implications of americas global arms sales and finally we looked at citizen responsibility in ending the absurdity and the insanity of our nuclear arms race and our rapidly escalating military budget a number of brilliant witnesses came to washington from all around the country to testify at these hearings i would like briefly to give a few highlights that a number of the witnesses presented during those hearings in april the first witness was former senator j william fulbright of arkansas former chairperson of the senate foreign relations committee from 1959 to 1975 senator fulbright led off the hearings he stated as follows and i quote this budget together with the propaganda to sell it to the public and the congress has the effect of shifting the focus of our policy from that of deterrence of nuclear war to the waging and the winning of a nuclear war further quoting he said this military budget is so large and the emphasis upon nuclear weapons so strong and the rhetoric about the soviet threat is so extreme that one cannot resist the feeling that we are preparing to fight and win a nuclear war i believe if this is the case that it is a dangerous game and could easily get out of control and lead to a disaster it is not only dangerous it is costly and it threatens the stability and the soundness of our domestic economy mr paul warnke former director of the arms control and disarmament agency testified as follows there is no basis in fact for the assertion that the soviet union has strategic nuclear superiority we lead in strategic warheads again it really doesnt matter but we have a lead we also lead when it comes to survivable forces mr paul warnke former director of the arms control and dis irmament agency there is no credible scenario in which we and the soviet unioh could fviht a nuclear war and have either one of us be declared the winner either one of us might come out somewhat better than the other but we would be worse off than uganda or bangladesh we would no longer be recognized as superpowers in fact the question is would we be recognizable as a national entity ms randy forsberg president and executive director of the institute for defense and disarmanent studies pulling the nuclear tripwire ever tighter by improving first strike capabilities is extremely risky and dangerous if we continue to make nuclear

it invites the arms race i see on the floor today many other members who have fought against the arms race throughout their careers in the house and each of us has been committed from the beginning to the question of a nuclear weapons freeze we are committed to the proposition that the reagan administration is doing too much planning for nuclear war and not enough to avoid it this latest pushto spend 4 2 billion on a wildeyed nuclear civil defense schemeis simply the latest and most ludicrous example this plan would elevate to policy the fantasy of a winnable nuclear war it holds out a cruel and false hope that by sleightofhand the administration can eliminate the horror and death of nuclear war worse by making the idea of nuclear war plausible we make war itself possible we all know that we are at the most dangerous moment of the nuclear era i say this because if the next round of nuclear weapons is deployed verification problems will be infinitely more difficult under any kind of strategic arms treaty likewise any futher attempt to negotiate or ratify such a treaty will become more difficult and if such new generations of nuclear weapons are deployed the first strike capability of these weapons raises the risk of those weapons being launched by accident because of a perceived intention on the other side to fire them at the other side and we will begin to get into a hairtrigger state because the only defense in this situation is to be in a launchonwarning posture which i think is incredibly dangerous to the entire human race around this chamber there are many of us who believe that we can reduce the possibility of nuclear war by decreasing existing arsenals and more tightly controlling the export of nuclear technology and material but unfortunately there are those within the administration who believe they can play games with weapons as meancing as those that are in our arsenals today there are those who have chosen as a matter of national policy to pursue nuclear agitation and then hand us the crazy evacuation plan now under consideration this kind of nuclear madness will only provoke the other side to respond in kind to which then we would find no end on either side this nuclear madness leads to cockeyed plans to build a civil defense system that will not work i say that because the premise upon which this plan is based is dead wrong no one wins a nuclear war no one is immune from the overwhelming death and destruction of such a war no one can truly hide from this reality the reagan civil defense program can be viewed in only one wayas an expensive provocation which does nothing to enhance our national security it would spend billions of dollars to build disaster shelters at a time when too many of our citizens cannot afford housing it would stockpile disaster food when our poor hungry and jobless are walking the streets at record rates in 1983 40 percent of all spending cuts in the reagan budget will come from programs such as social security unemployment insurance child nutrition and food stamps what sense is there to a nuclear evacuation plan when faced with these budget realities the people i talk to in my district in oregon do not think that is rational and they are right since there is no leadership coming from the administration it is in our hands here to create a climate in which we can reduce the chance of nuclear war that is why we should support amendments like the one before us today that is why we continue to fight for a freeze on nuclear weapons there is no other way to insure our survivability

the public is confused and worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself

which i believe will result in the most dramatic and substantial change in federal fiscal policy that has occurred in this country in the last 50 years whether we are democrat or republican i think all of us read what the american people were demanding last november they asked that there be serious restraint on the growth of federal spending and that we get our fiscal house in order the alternatives before us today regardless of which one you are talking about have a substantial dramatic change in federal fiscal policy from the outset i would like to reiterate what i stated when i asked my colleagues to elect me chairman of the committee on the budget and that is this that the funandgames time for the budget process is over if you want to continue the budget process then we ought to build a budget based on reality build a budget that will stand the test of time and pass a budget which we will support when the individual authorizing and appropriations bills come before the house of representatives i think we have the lattakemproth substitute or the republican substitute and the committee bill present a clear choice in many respects of ways to proceed on budget policy quite frankly i have been somewhat disturbed by reports that some of our colleagues say for political or other reasons they are going to support this or that alternative but that it really does not mean anything because when they come back to the authorizing votes and to the appropriating votes they will vote the other way what i want to set out from the very beginning is that so long as i am chairman of the committee on the budget i intend to do everything in my power to make the budget process realno more fun and gamesso that those who vote for the budget resolutions will know what is in those resolutionsand they will be expected to vote the same way when the individual authorizing and appropriating bills come before the house many people think that they can vote one way because of the immediate political pressure on them but that the pressure will be off 1 week from now 2 weeks from now 1 month from now i think it is incumbent upon every member of this body to know what is in these resolutions to know what they are voting on what they are cutting and what kind of tax program they are providing because those who look to you on this vote will be looking to you on subsequent votes to be consistent if you think you get out from under the pressure by casting a vote one way today and changing it the next time you are not going to do it because the same interest groups that are after you today will be after you tomorrow and you will look worse by being inconsistent so i hope that you will make it a point to know what is in these various alternatives some of the reports i have heard that my colleagues indicate that they may support the republican substitute they should keep in mind that it really does include the kemproth tax bill and there is no way to get around it the president of the united states just a few days ago from this chamber said that the tax program the kemproth tax program was integral to his program that there would be no compromise no alternative so those of you who vote for the latta republican substitute are voting for the kemproth tax bill and you ought to know it some say that a vote for the latta substitute does not include any kind of severe cuts in elementary and secondary education that is wrong the substitute includes deep cuts 25 percent cuts in elementary and secondary education and most of those cuts are going to affect education for handi capped children and you ought to know it some who have indicated that they may support the republican substitute say that that does not mean that we are not going to provide for filling the strategic petroleum reserve and that is not true the substitute cuts the support for the strategic petroleum reserve by 75 percent there is no way to get around it and you ought to know it when you vote the substitute i might also add will raise a point of order against the appropriation of 3 billion for the strategic petroleum reserve that is pending and ready to come to thenfoor of the house next week and you ought to know it some say that they may support the republican substitute but that it does not contain any cuts in vocational education or job training and that is not true it cuts vocational education it cuts job training and you ought to know it all i am saying is whether you are talking about the cuts in agricultural programs the cuts in job training the cuts in education or the kemproth tax bill if you feel you want to support that i will never question any member of this body on that decision you have your own reasons and you ought to vote for those reasons all i am saying is let us be consistent let us be honest with the american people and you vote today as you are going to vote for the rest of this year on the 1982 budget the budget committee will be keeping with the responsibilities we have a scorecard as to where we are and that scorecard is going to be embarrassing for some people if they are not consistent as the year goes on so that is one of the first points i wanted to make that is that i take my responsibility as chairman of this committee on the budget very seriously and whatever this body passes i will attempt to enforce to the letter now i want briefly to state how the committee resolution got to its present form because it was not a happen stance event it was guided by a number of principles and a number of goals that i personally had and the committee had a number of goals that were laid out after i was elected chairman of this committee the overriding goal that directed my attention was to put together a budget that would truly lessen the pressures on inflation unless we keep that goal uppermost we are npt responding to what the american people said they wanted in the elections last november what can we do to get inflation down another goal was to try to limit federal spending as a percent of gross national product many of you recall and some of you cosponsored the efforts we made in the last congress to start limiting federal spending and the first step was to limit federal spending to 22 5 percent of gnp that goal was achieved in this committee resolution as a matter of fact we actually cut spending more in aggregate terms than the administration recommended in its march 10 budget a third overriding goal was to recommend a tax policy designed to meet the needs of our country and the

would be glad for the gentleman to look at this but i would rather not yield right now i think there is a deeper central failure of the c17 and boeing 747 arguments and that is the assumption on both sides that you can calculate or plan the future the 747 argument calculates that it is possible to plan where you are going to fight and over and over again we have been told that you can preposition everything that we cannot carry on the 747 the c17 argument calculates that you can figure on building a cheaper airplane on time and on schedule let me suggest that there are three lessons from the falkland islands that shatter both the c17 and the boeing 747 argument first you want to win early and with as much force as possible you want to win decisively that means you want to deliver combat loaded equipment that rolls off and goes into battle you do not want to pull up and start assembling second you cannot be sure where trouble is coming no one in britain expected a war in the south atlantic no one in the united states can predict where we ought to prestock equipment and i dare say when you talk about cost if the 747 advocates would count in the cost of all the equipment they intend to prestock in all the places we have interests they would find their costs 10 or 20 times greater than the c5 third ultimately you fight with what you have when the battla starts the fact is that paper airplanes do not help you at all in this context let us look at our choices the c17 is a paper airplane every promise that has been made about delivery dates and cost of the c17 is just that a promise in fact every person who is concerned about bringing the pentagon under control should know full well that buying a paper airplane wit a paper date is a very dangerous game to start you know full well we will not get the c17 on time or on budgetit is pure paper july 2l 1982 then there is the boeing 747 offer the fact is that if the airline industry were not cutting orders boeing would be too busy selling what it has done best recently which is commercial airliners and commercial freight haulers to be dealing with the business it does not do particularly well which is landing near a battlefield to deliver combat equipment candidly the boeing 747 is a sad joke as a military aircraft it cannot land on short runways it cannot handle outsized cargo it cannot unload itself now the advocates in this debate tell us that we can pack outsized equipment in the c5 and everything else on 747s again i suggest that is precisely the intellectual arrogance of assuming that you can look ahead carefully enough that you can understand in enough detail what the world will be like that you can always be in charge of reality let me close by suggesting that if you can guarantee that we are not going to go to war in the near future then it makes sense to vote for the c17 in the nineties"], [0.9951025247573853, 0.9951025247573853, 0, "on july 16 1981 harry chapin singer songwriter humanitarian founder of world hunger year died in a tragic automobile accident known by so many of us in congress for his whirlwind dynamism and tireless unswerving commitment to ending world hunger harry chapin inspired an invigorating confidence that it was possible for policies and programs to be changed that the energies resources and great talents of our nation could be mobilized to breathe a fresh new life into the great humanitarian principles for which we want our nation to stand in one of his many finely crafted probing ballads harry queried now if a man tried to take his time on earth and prove before he died what one mans life could be worth well i wonder what would happen to this world during his short lifetime harry proved to so many people what his life was worth he was vision confidence inspiration unbridled energy and selfless dedication to others and his life matteredhe made a difference he constantly reminded us that hundreds of millions of people suffer from hunger and malnutrition that hunger makes every day for them a struggle whether or not their plight makes the nightly news or the morning paper as harry reviewed the cold statistics of hunger they became even more dramatic he reminded us that hunger is most vicious when it stalks the young that 100 000 children go blind each year because of vitamin deficiencies that in some poorer countries almost half the children die before reaching the age of 5 mostly from nutritionrelated diseases and that among the survivors handicaps of learning behavior and work capacity are widespread due to inadequate diets and recurring illness harry would repeat to himself and to millions of others that these conditions did not have to exist and people listened and they read and they learned that we do have the basic technological knowhow and resources to alleviate the hunger problem it became plain to those who began to familiarize themselvbs with the many dimensions and facets of the hunger problem that our task is formidable indeed but that is where harry came in many of my colleagues will attest to the fact that is was difficult if not impossible to avoid becoming totally enveloped in harrys electric enthusiasm he sparked a realization that the job was not going to get any easier that the time had come to roll up our sleeves to construct a comprehensive strategy against hunger more finely tuning those programs with a demonstrated record of success and terminating those programs which actually exacerbated the hunger problem i first met harry during the summer of 1977 he had come to washington seeking support for an idea he and his wife sandy had conceived creating a presidential commission on world hunger to find ways that our nation could develop more effective policies to combat hunger and malnutrition more comfortable in the jeans and casual shirts and shoes his fans recognized him in harry had come to town in a conservative threepiece suit that lobbying suit as harry liked to call it was to get quite a workout during the next year in between the hundreds of concerts he performedmore than half to benefit the hungerfighting activities of his world hunger year and food policy center organizationshe would return to washington to lobby for his hunger commission singlehandedly harry stormed the capitol along with me harry persuaded our former colleague rick nolan and senators pat leaiiy and bob dole to introduce a resolution urging the president to establish the commission he soon generated enough interest in the conmmission to attract 265 cosponsors in the house and 51 in the senate the presidential commission on world hunger was finally established in 1978 during the course of the next 2 years harry never missed a commission meeting often exhausted after a night of performing at a concert and the logistical nightmare of grabbing any available means of transportation to get back to washington for the commission meeting the next day harry nevertheless injected a spirit of infectious enthusiasm into those meetings he was the conscience of the commission everurging us to explore the deeply rooted causes of hunger and prodding us to produce a final report which did not equivocate did not pull any punches in detailing those actions our nation would have to take if the hunger problem was to be resolved harry chapin led our commissions efforts to involve the public in our deliberations and to explore ways to mobilize public opinion in support of comprehensive policy initiatives against hunger the commissions report did not reflect unanimous support for each of its findings or conclusions with differences of opinion noted in our report but we did provide the chief executive and the american public with some good thoughtful recommendations producing a document which has served as a vehicle to stimulate muchneeded public discussion about the dimensions of and threats posed by world hunger the end of the commission did not end harry chapins commitment to ending hunger it was but a new beginning meeting with him on a number of occasions during this past year harry expressed his everpresent concern that congress and the administration commit itself to developing new hunger policies he continued to pound upon the doors of staid indifference to the global suffering and instability that hunger breeds i always had to listen very carefully when harry spoke because he could pack into 5 minutes more thoughtful innovative ideas than anyone i have known in a conversion he was a master at conceptually changing gears launching a fusillade of incisive questions comments and proposals on a variety of topics it was as if he were afraid he would not have the time to discuss and to do all those things that truly mattered to him there is an empty space now where once there was boundless energy and unfettered contagious enthusiasm calling for an end to world hunger harry once asked and if our future lies on the final line are we brave enough to see the signals and the signs resolving the complicated global problem of hunger will not be an easy task it will be that much more difficult with the absence of a prodding insistent force such as harry chapin but world hunger does place our future on the final line harry took the time to see the signals and the signs of an awesome menacing problem which if left to fester would visit an unprecedented catastrophe on us all he bravely confronted powerful institutional impediments to change and individuals revering the status quo he underscored the urgent need for courageous decisions if our nation were to act against hunger while the best opportunities for success still existed we greatly miss harry chapin our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to his wife sandy and their five children jamie jason jond jenny and josh during this grievous period but those of us who harry touched so deeply who remember the hopefilled strains of his songs who recall his unfailing commitment to others will not let harrys vision and dream be forgotten i urge my colleagues to find in the spirit of harry chapin their own determination to channel the necessary resources and energies of our nation into a long term comprehensive strategy to end world hunger"], [0.9945685635320842, 0.005431436467915773, 1, "i thank the gentle to reaching this goal is

peopleour constituents who have time and time again expressed themselves in favor of limiting the growth of the federal government well perhaps i can persuade my colleagues to listen to the voice of the future generation 19 years ago the federal budget was scarcely 100 billion who then would have believed that today the house budget co~mmittee would be seeking a 715 billion budget who would have been elected in support of such a budget 19 years hence well who today wants the budget in the year 2000 19 years away to surpass 2 860 billion if we allow the current budget committee proposal to

h r 1799 the antitrust provisions which were referred to the judiciary committee and to which the subcommittee on monopolies and commercial law gave long and careful consideration there were times when i and others felt that our consideration was becoming altogether too long and too careful but the bill which we have ultimately reported is a good one and merits the support of every member it is difficult to discuss this legislation without some reference to h r 5235 formerly h r 2326 the bill introduced by chairman rodino and myself to clarify the application of the antitrust laws to export trade activities this was our initial response to the complaint that many american businessmen were unwilling or unable to compete with confidence in the international marketplace because of their uncertainty regarding their antitrust liability that bill reflects our belief that the proper response to exporters who believe the law is unclear is to clarify the law this it seems to me is far more important than the licensing procedures such as the provisions in the export trading legislation passed by the senate as the rodinomcclory bill has moved forward it became evident that nothing less than some sort of certification system was desired by the business community even if h r 5235 were to be enacted clarifying the nonapplication of our antitrust laws to purely foreign activities title ii of h r 1799 is the judiciary committees considered response it compares extremely favorably with the senate approach i might say in terms of simplified procedure expedit0ed processing and certain results it provides exporters with a binding advisory opinion on the legality of their proposed conduct rather than providing an outright antitrust exemption as the senate bill attempts to do this eliminates also the cumbersome requirement that exporters establish a special need as a condition precedent to exemption the 6nly issue to be decided in processing an application under our bill is whether the proposed conduct is likely to violate the antitrust laws of the united states the members of the monopolies and commercial law subcommittee were virtually unanimous therefore in deciding that this determination should be made by the department of justice rather than by the department of commerce there would seem to be little benefit conferred by an antitrust certificate from the department of commerce which the department of justice could attack and it would be wrong to bar the antitrust division from exercising its enforcement function in my opinion without its first having the opportunity to subject the proposed conduct to antitrust review an optional forwarding role for the commerce department is allowed nevertheless which should encourage the applicant to use that agencys informational and advisory services careful thought was also given to the question of damages which may be recovered by a person injured by an antitrust violation committed by a person acting pursuant to a certificate there is no question of course that treble damages lie for conduct outside of the certificate it is also possile however although unlikely that certified conduct may result in injury in domestic commerce although the administration and the senate have suggested that certified conduct should be totally immune from liability the judiciary committee of the house firmly believes that single damages are most necessary and appropriate it is sometimes forgotten that antitrust damages are not only a penalty but a protection and the person compensated most often will be another american business with a legitimate clair to be made whole for its antitrust injury single damages for domestic injury by the holder of an export trade certificate were perceived as a fair compromise between the traditional statutory treble damages and no damages if no damages were to be the rule the governmental agency granting certification would have to be more conservative in close cases granting benefits to fewer applicants furthermore fairness would also then require that greater procedural protections be provided for interested parties who feared future injury since such parties would subsequently be denied damages on the other hand with single damages as the rule certification could take place administratively without a hearing without third parties arguing their case and thus without protracted delays finally if no damages were to be the rule the only way a court could compensate the injured american business would be to hold the conduct in question to be ultra vires outside the certificate in which case treble damages would lie with a singledamages rule however the court would have a fairer solution availableone which compensates the injured party but does not punish the wrongdoer who believed that his conduct fell within the scope of the certificate some have argued that the senate bill is preferable because it protects exporters from lawsuits by providing zero damages rather than single damages where certified conduct causes the complained of injury but our committee has given this argument a long hard look talked to antitrust lawyers and found this argument without merit for the senate bill would only change the nature of pleading antitrust violations and probably result in treble damage awards on grounds that the conduct in question was ultra vires our bill would preserve and assure single damages for the injured plaintiff but would restrain the filing of lawsuits against exporters by means of the most liberal provision of attorneys fees for defendants within the sweep of my experience for if the certified conduct has not violated the antitrust laws the plaintiff must pay to the defendant exporter a reasonable attorneys fee even if the suit was brought in good faith and even if the suit was nonfrivolous that should make plaintiffs think twice about suing an exporter holding a certificate this bill has been carefully constructed to provide greater certainty to exporters by providing them the assurance of an antitrust review and certification procedure i believe it will enable american businessmen to compete with

confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say

thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of

deem approirm priate the committee urges the secord retary of agriculture to use the man dm date provided in executive order blue 12261 to facilitate the exercise of the re authority granted in h r 6142 in es making available to federal agencies 3 3 the liquid fuels processed from stocks 3cal of commodity credit corporation amn it is rather unusual fir iuc a single piece of legislation to jeal

to the ds author of the legislation the gentleing man from iowa iin mr bedell asked and was given 2 5 permission to revise and extend his re1 7 marks and to include extraneous orn matter ein mr bedell first i ten would like to thank the chairman of ve the committee and particularly i on extend my thanks to my colleague the gentleman from illinois ent the coauthor of this legislation for so the work which he has done on this de legislation oil as has already been explained h r al 6142 as amended would authorize the ket secretary of agirculture to provide for th the processing of commodity credit han corporation stocks of agricultural in commodities into liquid fuels and agriuel cultural commodity byproducts lco the legislation further provides the secretary with discretion to establish the the terms and conditions under which my the corporations stocks are to be of made available for processing by liquid ite fuel producers the liquid fuels prope duced may be made available by the vel corporation to federal agencies either al to help them meet their immediate ces needs for transportation and industriaod al fuels or for storage for later emerbe gency fuel uses in addition the secreion tary is given authority to sell the liquid fuels in commercial markets provided any sale does not disrupt commercial markets for the liquid fuels the measure also instructs the secretary in determining the feasibility of offering corporation stocks of agricultural commodities for processing into liquid fuels and agricultural commodity byproducts to consider the likely cost to the federal government of retaining ownership of the stocks in their original form the impact of excessive supplies of governmentowned stocks in depressing agricultural commodity prices and the value and usefulness of the stbcks as liquid fuels and agricultural commodity byproducts h r 6142 was approved by the committee on agriculture on a unanimous voice vote and enjoys the support of 30 members of the house including the chairman of the subcommittee on fossil and synthetic fuels mr sharp prospects for record grain production and carryover levels increasing acquisitions of grain under the price support activities of the commodity credit corporation a reversal in the long series of yeartoyear increases in u 9 farm exports and the failure of the united states to attain adequate jelfsufficiency in the production of liquid fuels confirm the need for directing a significant portion of unitedstates agricultural production toward fostering the continued growth of the young domestic alcohol fuels industry recent projections by the unitedstates department of agriculture forecast record unitedstates production of major farm commodities including corn 8 32 billion bushels wheat 2 82 billion bushels and soybeans 2 31 billion bushels the 198283 season carryover estimated for corn alone is a record of 2 8 billion bushels which far surpasses historical levels this anticipated production has pressured farm prices to severely depressed levels and sharply increased expected outlays for farm price support programs current price quotations in local markets for 1982 crops of wheat corn and soybeans are well below 3 50 2 and 5 per bushel respectively recently the estimate for projected commodity credit corporation outlays for its price support activities was doubled to nearly 11 billion the expected record crops threaten to tax the grain handling and storage system as never before new storage facilities are being constructed at a rapid pace and the federal government is approving for commercial storage facilities that were once considered substandard and inadequate to miintain grain in proper condition not only are private stocks of grain held on the farm and in commercial elevators accumulating to record levels govbrnment stocks of farm commodities are also building rapidly as producers forfeit to the commodity credit corporation grain used to secure government price support loans by the end of the 198283 marketing year usda projects that cccowned stocks of corn will increase by at least 150 million bushels to nearly 400 million bushels the estimated firstyear cost to ccc of assuming ownership of a bushel of corn is estimated to be at least 0 80 per bushel when commercial storage rates transportation and handling charges forfeited interest on the loan and forgone firstyear interest revenue on the grain in ccc possession are considered in addition given current severe restrictions on cccs authority to return grain under its ownership to commercial markets as well as prospects for continued depressed farm prices in the near term ccc is likely to own this grain at substantial additional cost for some time one of the primary reasons that agriculture finds itself in a depressed state is the deterioration in the farm export outlook the burden of record agricultural surpluses has been compounded by this reduction in the value of unitedstates farm exportsthe first such reduction since 1969 in addition certain commodities are experiencing a reduction in export volume as well as value corn export shipments for example are at a 5year low the dismal prospects for resumed strong growth in unitedstates export markets point to the need for developing additional domestic outlets for our grain production the development of an established alcohol fuels industry offers the potential for creating substantial new domestic demand for grain a goal which if realized could lead to strong and stable prices for american producers a mature alcohol fuels industry could also serve as a model for current efforts to promote the value added production and export for unitedstates goods for example those alcohol producers using the wet milling process can obtain from one 56pound bushel of corn 2 5 gallons of anhydrous ethanol 1 7 pounds of corn oil 3 pounds of corn gluten meal a 60percent protein product 14 5 pounds of corn gluten feed a 21percent protein additive and 15 pounds of highgrade carbon dioxide in addition wetmilling facilities have the flexibility to reduce their ethanol production in favor or producing high fructose corn syrup in a dry milling facility 2 5 gallons of ethanol and nearly 17 pounds of a 26 to 32percent protein material call dried distillers grain ddg remain after the process according to a 1981 study by the unitedstates department of energys office of alcohol fuels based on mid1981 corn prices unitedstates onp would increase by 1 89 for each bushel of corn diverted from the export market to produce ethanol similar studies have projected the increased employment national income and balance of payments benefits that would likely accrue to the united states if a strong alcohol fuels industry were established contrary to the current widely held perception sales of gasoline alcohol blend fuels have not declined in the face of the curent oil glut and period of moderate gasoline prices as the information in the tables below relates alcohol blend fuelscommonly marketed today as super unleaded with ethanol or unleaded plus r ither than gasohol are attaining a steadily
