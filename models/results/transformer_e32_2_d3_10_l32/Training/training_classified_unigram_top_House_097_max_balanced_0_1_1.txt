and to remind my colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure and may someday this

about almost doubling it in the year 1986 to shock the members in a different way in the decade of the 1970s this country and many of us served in the house during the seventies we spent 1 trillion on the military function in the first 5 years of the 1980s we are anticipating spending between 1 3 to 1 5 trillion with cost overruns and what have you it is conceivable in the first 5 years of the 1980s our military budget expenditure could exceed 2 trillion if we project that out to the year 1990 it is clear by most con~servative figures that this country will be spending between 2v2 trillion and maybe 2 7 trillion or 2 8 trillion so in a 10year period we are talking about more than doubling close to tripling the military budget now the qu tion that the average citizen in this country ought to be asking is how do you finance this large substantial sustained increase~ in the military budget members of the committee there are really only three ways you can do it either you go to the american people and you say that the nature of the world is so frighten ing so dangerous so unstable that we must now askthie american people for new taxes in order to finance this incredible burden but not one politician in this body the other body or down at the other end of pennsylvania avenue is actually advocating levying new taxes to finance this increase so let us throw that out as an option the second alternative is to engage in substantial budg6t deficit spending but this administration has trapped itself in the rhetoric of the balanced budget it cannot insult my intellect nor the intellect of the american people by suggesting that a democratlc party budget deficit is inflationary and a republican party deficit is not inflationary we know that is absurd so to engage in deficit sepending is a travesty they have t6 show by the next election that they had moved toward a balanced budget or they have lost credibility so they cannot engage in deficit spending for any substantial period of time to finance this incredible increase in this military budget to 367 lbillion by fiscal year 1986 so what is the third alternative the third alternative is to reach into the nonmilitary side of the budget and engage in substantial cuts in order to finance this incredible increase in the military budget and that is the assertion that i make on the floor this afternoon this administration suggested a budget authority cut of 48 4 billion on the nonmilitary side and led the american people to believe that we are reducing federal expenditures a couple of weeks later you make a budget schedule that increases the military budget by 53 3 billion that has to be a wash the argument that i assert aggressively is that these budget cuts are not designed to fight inflation our own congressional budget office indicated that cutting 2 5 billion from the budget would only reduce the inflation rate by between 0 1 and 0 2 of 1 percent so what is this all about it is about financing an increase in the military budget which becomes the least politically risky and the safest way to do it because levying taxes has political implications engaging in continued budget deficits has political implications but ripping off the poor ripping off workingclass people ripping off senior citizens ripping off the children and middleincome citizens of america is becoming the safest way to engage in financing military budgets the american people need to desperately understand that is what this is all about so the question then becomes is there a rationale for the expenditures and for this incredible amount of money i do not believe so and later in this debate we will be making a significant argument that challenges the assumptions of those who perceive the prob lems of the world as being military problems that can be solved in a military fashion there are those of us in this body who frankly and legitimately believe that the problem of the 1980s bring new imperatives call for new policies there are 160 nations in the world many of them eager for freedom and to simplylook through the narrow confines of the parochial prism of united statessoviet ideological relations is an absurdity we have to begin to look at the economic social and political realities of human mnisery in the world and that does not dictate this incredible expenditure of the military budget to rip off millions of human beings who have a right in a free and open democratic society to believe that their government would not abandon them should not be the people upon whose back we build an incredible military machine there have been a number of economists who have pointed out that there are really only two ramifications for going down this road either we bankrupt this nation by moving more and more of its resources into a smaller and smaller segment of economy and the bottom drops out from the sheer weight of this"], [0.0015391111373901367, 0.9984608888626099, 1,

the congress as one member who is associated with the congimssional black caucus alternative i want to say i was very struck in observing the debate yesterday how much the caucus substitute affected members on the other side of aisle my colleague from new york and a leader of the administrations budget forces mr kemf in particular said a number of favorable things about the caucus budget yesterday andi i want to congratulate him on his remarks i recall that my colleague from new york did take issue with the overall tax revenue proposale in the caucur budget while at the same time congratulating the caucus in proposing the indexing of the tax code to inflatiotn and the 10percent nonrefundable social security tax credit it is good to know that at least one person on the other side of the aisle thinks the opposition is capable of having positive ideas on how to solve the economys problems yet my col3eague did say the following in opposition to our budget proposal i just wish my friends in the caucus had not seen fit to raise taxes so heavily on everyone else in the country and introduce so many zerosum tradeoffs by pitting one class of taxpayer against another what we need is more equity for all americans and less pitting classes of people against each other if this is the case then my colleague from new york should join in support of the congressional black caucus substitute after all as the dsg fact sheet on the budget says the caucus substitute offers the largest anld fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house i wish to ask my colleague from new york who is responsible for pitting classes of people against each other the cbc or the reagan administration who is calling for more tax equity and reform of a tax code that everyone knows presently is grossly inequitablethe cbc or the reagan administration who is demanding basic cuts or eliminations of domestic human resource programs the result of which will be even greater poverty than exists today and even greater unemploymentthe cbc or the reagan administration i would like my colleague from new york to answer these questions i would add a personal observation is there any one in this body who really thinks the reagan administration lattagramm budget is contributing to national unity and social consensus i would like to hear it frankly the greatest tragedy of the administrations budget plan is that it may become the single biggest factor of divisiveness and social unrest in the nation that has occurred in many years the presidents proposals in the areas of national defense and taxation 111887 will contribu~te the most to disunity in tive they need to boost productivity the nation and production it did not go unnoticed yesterday the caucus tax package

group this proposal gives domestic conflict and economic weakbusinesses the kind of economic incen ness in the coming years i am not alone in warning of this economists as diverse as henry kaufmanwho is often called the sage of wall street and a republican i might adddr wassily leontieff the nobel prizewinning economist and authority on economic structures at new york university and dr lester thurow of mit in the last few months have all voiced the strongest doubts about the economic viability and desirability of the reagan administrations defense program i notice yesterday as reported in the washington post today the mormon church and its leaders ii a very rare comment on national policies came out in opposition to the mx missile system their statement of opposition it should be noticed by my colleagues went far beyond the mx missile the mormon church leadership squarely attacked the basic assumptions behind the unitedstates military establishment the soviet military establishment and the frightening global arms race that both superpowers equally are contributing toward referring to the terrifying arms race that~ has to be halted spencer w kimball president of the mormon church stated we deplore in particular the building of vast arsenals of nuclear weaponry history indicates that men have seldon created armaments that eventually were not put to use 0 with the most serious concern over the pressing moral question of possible nuclear conflict we plead with our national leaders to marshal the genius of the nation to find viable alternatives the mormon church leadership is referring to the deadly world arms race that is draining nations of their resources and revenues that otherwise would be spent on economic and social develolimentspecifically which last year exceeded 500 billion dollars and which the reagan administration in its budget proposal is contributing mightily toward i believe there is a growing sense in this body that the defense budget will undo~whatever good might resultfrom administration economic policies and i say this as one who is highly skeptical about the administrations policies if the congresssional black caulcus and a handful of socalled house liberals alone had challenged the reagan defense budget it likely would have been dismissed summarily but the caucus is not alone in its criticism of the transfer of some 50 billion in additional budget authority to dod next year we are joined by leading churches in the land by highly respectable economists and financial leaders the simple truth is that the defense budget that the administration is proposing will intensify inflation because inflationary costs in the defense sector have been running at twice the rate as in the economy overall intensify inflation because of the widely acknowledged shortages of pro may 6 1981 duction in the defense sector and in the shortages of its labor force intensify inflation because of the widely reported monopolistic practice among defense contractors the lack of competitive contract bidding at dod and the widespread lack of pentagon control over its own budget intensify inflation because in the aggregate boosts in defense spending add income but not consumer goods and services and therefore add to the class inflation of too many dollars chasing too few goods and shift badly needed investment capital away from the civilian sectors of the economy that are mnost in need of revitalization i detect among my colleagues especially on the opposite side of the aisle a growing uneasiness about the administrations and the latta0ramms defense budget that uneasiness is understandable no one has come up with a convincing argument why an additional 50 billion in defense is needed other than the ageold shibboleths about national security and the russians are coming this morning i went over some comparative figures on the relative strengths of the unitedstates defense establishment and the soviets in termsa of defense spending during the last 10 years the nato allies have outspent the warsaw pact by 207 billion according to londons international institute for strategic studies in terms of strategic nuclear warheads the best measure of relative numerical strengths the united states has 9 200 warheads as compared to 7 000 on the soviet side of equal importance the united states has far greater command control flexibility and survivability in relation to its ability to fight a nuclear war than has the soviet union for example only 25 percent of our strategic warheads are land basedand relatively vulnerableas compared to 80 percent of the soviets warheads and because of our triad of strategic forceslandbased seabased and airbasedthe united states has a wide advantage over the soviets for example 48 percent of our strategic warheads are either at sea alert or in bombers on alert as compared to 3 percent of the soviets warheads there is a shocking orthodoxy in this chamber about the need for a stronger defense establishment despite the facts and figures despite the questionability of ever winning a nuclear war however limited or of needing any more nuclear arms than we presently have as the mormon church leaders observed my col leagues especially on the other side of the aisle still cling to the panacea of more defense spending as if it were a reflex action that arises when no other solutions to our economys problems and the worlds problems are in sight i think we ought to debate many more hours the role of defense spending in the administrations budget and in relation to economic recovery we ought to debate many more hours the assumptions behind the reagan lattagramm budget and the alternative that the congressional black caucus is proposing i would now like to touch briefly upon a matter which in terms of dollars may be considered relatively insignificant in relation to the overall federal budget however it is a very important matter because of its direct bearing upon the quality of justice in this country i speak of the legal services corporation when the congress enacted the legislation establishing the legal services corporation in 1974 it made findings about the need for such a program the congress specifically found that first there is a need in this country for equal access to our system of justice second there is a need to provide highquality legal assistance to those who are unable to afford it third providing legal assistance to those facing an economic barrier to obtaining legal help serves the ends of justice fourth the availability of legal assistance has reaffirmed for many people their faith in our government of laws pifth a legal services program should be kept free of the influence of political pressures and sixth attorneys who provide legal assistance under such a program must have full freedom to protect the best interests of their clients just as other members of the bar have full freedom to protect their clients interests those findings are as valid and accurate today as they were in 1974 and the need for a legal services corporation today is as great as it was in 1974 continued funding of the corporation is essential if we are to keep this countrys commitment to equal justice under the law the need for the continuation of the legal services corporation has been widely recognized in addition to numerous individual private attorneys district attorneys judges state attorneys general and state governors many national organizations have called for continued funding of the corporation including the american bar association the american association of retired persons national association of retired teachers the aflcio the american coalition of citizens with disabilities the childrens defense fund the friends committee on national legislation the league of united latin american citizens lulac the lead ership conference on civil rights the national bar association the national council of churches the national council of senior citizens the national committee against discrimination in housing the national mental health association the national farmers union the national council on aging the national urban league the national legal aid and defender association the united states conference of mayors the united states catholic conference and rural america one of the announced goals of this administration is a reduction in what it refers to as unnecessary and inefficient federal regulations continuation of the legal services corporation will not frustrate that goal the legal services corporation does not engage in any substantive regulation and it is not a part of the federal bureaucracy in addition the corporations programs are locally controlled the corporation has been soundly managed and its programs have been costeffectiveit expends only 1 8 percent of its funds on management and administration and another 1 8 percent for field monitoring and evaluation continuation of the legal services corporation has bipartisan support just last monday the judiciary committees subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice unanimously reported an authorization bill for the corporation that bill authorizes 200 million for the corporation for each of the next 2 fiscal years in addition the bill addresses some of the criticisms that have been leveled at the corporation such as in the area of class action suits and lobb ying i urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to continue the important work of the legal services corporation"], [0.001546025276184082, 0.9984539747238159, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding this is truly a historic debate we are conducting today in the unitedstates house of representatives not since 1969 when the country was going through the agony of the war in vietnam has the house conducted a debate such as the one we are engaged in today thirteen years ago this house talked about a war in a small country in southeast asia today we talk about global wara war that would end civilization as we know it the subject we are addressing today is the ultimate subject we can debate in this chamber the condition of the economy at if the silos are emptied there will be no economy we can argue for thi social program and that social program but after nuclear war there will be no society we can have one foreign policy initiative after another but if the warheads explode the entire international order and structure will be dismembered i commend representatives jim leach and matthew mchugh and the staff of members of congress for peace through law for organizing this debate it is long overdue representatives conte bingham and i have introduced a resolution in the house calling on the superpowers to freeze their nuclear arsenals and begin cutting back so far 160 members of the house have cosponsored this resolution a similar resolution introduced in the senate by senators kennedy and hatfield has attracted more than 20 cosponsors in that chamber but this discussion today is not the result of this resolution no this measure is part of a much largeri movement gaining strength in the country that movement has a clear and simple message enough is enough the arms race must be halted before we blow ourselves of the face of the earth the nuclear arsenals of both superpowers must be reduced and reduced drastically why has the public suddenly turned itself toward nuclear arms control and disarmament because the public is afraid the american people want a strong defense but they are afraid that the 1 7 trillion arms buildup of the reagan administration heats up an arms race where nobody wins they do not want nuclear war but they hear talk of nuclear warning shots from their secretary of state and limited nuclear war in europe from their president they do not want other countries to acquire nuclear bombs but they see nuclear trade policies from the admi istration that show that proliferation will be none of its business all across the country religious leaders business executives lawyers doctors college students and local legislators to name a few are organizing to demand a halt to the nuclear arms race the one initiative gaining momen tum nationwide is the proposal for the united states and the soviet union to freeze their nuclear arsenals so far more than a million people have signed freeze petitions in california a compaign is under way to place a referendum on the november state ballot calling for a freeze the campaign has collected about a half million signatures nuclear freeze groups have sprung up in 43 states and 279 congressional districts the massachusetts oregon and new yor4 legislatures have passed freeze resolutions more than 160 vermont towns have voted to support the freeze these are not people who want the united states to lay down its arms they are not advocating unilateral disarmament they are people with commonsense they are people who want both sides to stop the arms race the contemarkeybingham resolution is a response to that commonsense appeal the resolution calls on the superpowers to halt the arms race it calls on the united states and the soviet union to sit down and negotiate a mutual and verifiable freeze on the testing production and further de ployment of nuclear warheads mis siles and other delivery systems it calls on the superpowers to then begin major mutual and verifiable reductions in their nuclear arsenals yes there will have to be some giver and take at the negotiating table because of differences in both sides deployment cycles deciding on how to draw the line on testing production and deployment and figuring out how to cut back on the weapons will certainly keep the negotiators busy yes the process of implementing a freeze will be arduous and detailed but we have no choice but to begin that process for time is running out the arms race is getting out of control the overkill the two superpowers have amassed defies any rational justification the weapons states now have more than 50 000 nuclear weapons with a total explosive power equal to 1 million hiroshima bombs one poseidon submarine has enough warheads to cause 30 million fatalities in the soviet union more than it suffered in all of world war ii in europe alone the united states has one nuclear weapon for every 50 soldiers just 200 of the some 9 000 strategic warheads in the unitedstates arsenal would destroy every major city in the soviet union but now the american public is being told this overkill is not enough the administration wants to build 17 000 more bombs over the next 15 years i both the united states and the soviet union are in the process of deploying or producing a new generation of weapons deadly weapons like the soviet ss18 and the american mx missile that improve each sides ability to knock out the others missiles in a nuclear exchange and will put a hair trigger on nuclear deterrence both sides are taking technological leaps in the research and development of nuclear weapons that will make it more difficult to negotiate arms control treaties george kennan once said that the nuclear bomb is the most useless weapon ever invented it can be employed to no rational purpose but now we hear dangerous talk from the white house the state department and the pentagon about using nuclear weapons we hear talk of waging a nuclear war rationally of employing nuclear weapons as instruments of foreign policy we hear this laughable statement from mr t k jones a deputy undersecretary over at dod who says that everybodys going to make it if there are enough shovels to go around his plan is for each american to dig a hole throw 3 feet of dirt on top so its the dirt we are told that does it we read in the paper today that president reagan pland to spend 4 2 billion on a program to relocate twothirds of the american public in case of a threat of nuclear war not only would this be a waste of money such a program would dangerously delude the public into thinking it can survive a nuclear holocaust and win when the bombs explode there will be no winners while the administration professes that it wants to deter nuclear war it is pursuingpolicies and developiqg weapons that could push us into a nuclear war we must now realize that spending more money on more nuclear weapons merely buys us more trouble our resolution has received quite a bit of criticism recently that criticism reached a low point with this ad from the college republican national committee which is an auxiliary of the republican national committee the ad says the soviet union needs you support a unitedstates nuclear freeze to imply as this ad does that the 160 representatives who have cospon sored our resolution22 of whom are republicansto imply that they are preaching moscows line is an affront to their integrity and intelligence to imply that rev billy graham and averell harriman and the more than 300 prominent individuals and organizations across the country who have endorsed this resolution are communist sympathizers does a monumental disservice to people who are committed to the security of america i also wish the administration would expend as much energy stopping the arms race as it has attacking our resolution the administration claims that our resolution would freeze the united states into a disadvantaged position with the soviets that is not true each side has advantages over the other in certain weapons systems but overall there exists a balance of imbalances between the two superpowers when administration critics talk about a disadvantaged position i would ask them which position they would rather have the soviets they have no bomber fleet to speak of their subs are noisy and easy to detect and more than threefourths of their missiles sit in vulnerable landbased silos or would they rather be in the american position half our missiles are in invulnerable submarines more than onefourth are on intercontinental bombers and we lead the soviets in warheads 9 000 to 7 000 the russians are not 10 feet tall we do a great disservice to our defense posture when we claim we are weaker than the soviets the fact is we have more than enough firepower to reduce the soviet union to rubble they know it we know it the american public knows it and it is about time the administration knows it the administration claims that our resolution cannot be verified that is not true a freeze and reduction in both sides nuclear armaments can be verified so each side be confident that violations affecting our national security would be detected in fact verification would be much easier if we freeze now and reduce the stockpiles than if we heat up the arms race and try to negotiate reductions as the administration proposes if we have a massive arms buildup as the administration advocates we will end up with more nuclear weapons that will be harder to verify when we go to the negotiating table the administration claims that our resolution undercuts the negotiations in europe that is not true both the soviet union and the united states have b en playing to the gallery in their neg aiations over a few thousand nuclear weapons in europe meanwhile the question of how we cut back on the 50 000 warheads stockpile worldwide remains ignored obviously the brezhnev proposal for a freeze in intermediaterange missiles in europe is inadequate but instead of rejecting that proposal out of hand as the reagan administration has done we should challenge the soviets to freeze and reduce all nuclear arms finally we now hear that the president plans to endorse a socalled freeze resolution in the senate sponsored by senators jacason and warner that is not good enough mr president the jacksonwarner resolution calls for a longterm freeze in other words it says let us build just a few thousand more weapons then lets talk about freezing the arsenals let us deploy the mx the b1 bomber and groundlaunched and sealaunched cruise missiles then well stop it is the same old tired line the american public has been hearing from its leaders for the last three decades just let us complete the arms race and then we will talk about disarmament it will not wash the arms race can never be completed when we build more they build more when we mirv they mirv when we build the cruise missile they will build the cruise missile and the arms race will never end the american people are tired of excuses they are tired of being fed this baloney that we must arm to disarm they are afraid of all this talk from the reagan administration about nuclear waring shots about nuclear proliferation beizlk none of our business and about a limited nuclear war in europe they want the arms race to stop"], [0.0016041398048400879, 0.9983958601951599, 1, "i want to report on hearings held recently by the house small business oversight subcommittee which i cha r on todays business failure epidemic and the devastating toll it is taking on small business the subcommittee invited leading experts from the academic business and bankruptcy worlds to testify to find out why so many businesses are failing and what it means for our economy the hearings were held against the backdrop of the gravest crisis faced by american business since the great depression this is what we see capital investment by companies is off sharply data resources inc forecasts that business investment will be off 8 percent this year over last year despite the massive tax incentives to invest enacted last year aftertax profits of corporations in the first quarter of 1982 were almost onethird lower than a year earlier the sharpest drop in the postwar period the new york times reported earlier this week that corporate profits have reached the lowest levels in perhaps 5 years many companies are saddled with heavy shortterm debt the ratio of shortterm debt to total debt is at a new high business balance sheets and corporate liquidity are more fragile than at any other time in postwar history since the first quarter of 1981 industrial output has dropped more than 7 percent our nations factories ran at a dismal 69 8 percent of capacity in june of this year 15 percentage points below the rate at which capital goods makers start getting orders for equipment to add capacity small business proprietorship income is expected to be nearly 15 percent lower this year than in 1980 according to data resources inc and businesses are failing at a rate not seen since the great depression todays figures as reported by dun bradstreet the business information concern are truly alarming the failure rate today is almost 90 per 10 000 listed companies just short of the failure rate of 100 per 10 000 companies recorded in the great depression year of 1933 put another way 11 businesses are failing right now for every hour of the business day business failures have only become a serious problem since 1981 looking back over the postwar period we find that business failures ranged between 1946 and 1980 from a low of 5 per 10 000 listed companies in 1946 to a high of 64 per 10 000 in 1961 the business failure rate average for those 35 years was 40 3 per 10 000 listed companies beginning in 1981 however business failures began to shoot up in 1980 l11742 companies or 42 per 10 000 companies failed in 1981 the figures jumped to 16 800 or 62 per 10 000 companies for 1982 the prediction is 25 000 or 88 per 10 000 listed companies the average for 1981 and the first half of 1982 is 75 per 10 000 companies an 86 percent increase over the 194680 average in the past 2 years the business failure rate has jumped 110 percent the second largest 2year jump since 1920 the only time it was higher was in the 2 years immediately after world war ii when business failures returned from the depressed war level to normal todays figures are indeed grim we should remember that the dun bradstreet figures cover only failures which involve losses to creditcs the number of business failures today is really much higher since thousands of businessmen simply decide to close their businesses because they see only an unprofitable future these business closings which are really failures reflect a lack of confidence in the business environment and are not reflected in dun bradstreets statistics as president reagans recently released report on the state of small business tells us the dun bradstreet figures are a valuable indicator of business distress the hearings looked at this distress not only in numerical terms but in human terms what we are seeing today is a great human tragedy we must not forget that business failures mean lost jobs ruined lives and dashed dreams they mean lost pensions lost life savings and lost tax revenues they also take a human toll in the lost selfesteem felt by those directly affected they mean an end to the american dream of opportunity and owning ones own business that has been such a powerful art of this nations dynamism last march when it was becoming clear that 1982 would see a record number of business failures i wrote to 2 dozen unitedstates bankruptcy judges and trustees to find out why this was happening i wanted to hear directly from them because they are seeing every day what is happening why it is happening and what needs to be done to end this terrible spiral of failure i received 19 replies from throughout the nation which i included in the hearing record this is the picture that emerged from the letter business are failing in all sections of the country and in every economic sector large and small businesses and young and old businesses are failing business are failing in record numbers and the failure rate continues to rise the business failures experienced today are much worse than those experienced during the last severe recession of 19741975 business are failing today because of high interest rates and the deep recession the revised federal bankruptcy code is not a cause of the increased number of business bankruptcy filings let me read a few of the responses unitedstates bankruptcy judge peter m elliott of los angeles wrote i would say that the major cause of small business failures is high interest rates unitedstates trustee william p westphal sr of minneapolis wrote the two primary causes for the increase in bankruptcies generally as well as for small business in particular are the extremely high interest rates and the length of the current recession unitedstates trustee scott h bush of dallas wrote the tentacles of the current recession reach to all communities at all locations even the glorious sunbelt has not been insulated the current recession is much more severe than the 19741975 recession unitedstates bankruptcy judge charles b mccormick of chicago wrote the increase in small business bankruptcy filings must i feel be blamed on the common elements of high interest tight money inflation the loss of jobs due to plant closings and the farming out of work to foreign countries and the other ills that greet one in the media every day unitedstates bankruptcy judge william l norton jr of atlanta wrote i do not see incompetency or mismanagement or dishonest actions in individuals or businessmen which some credit grantors or others ascribe to debtors in the bankruptcy court as being the cause of prevalence in bankruptcies i see the overwhelming number of individual and business debtors in this court who sincerely and honestly want to pay their debts and have been and are attempting to pay such debts i see many businesses and persons in my court who i feel there but for the grace of god go i as the letters i received show high interest rates and the prolonged and deep recession are placing an extraordinarily heavy burden on all businesses and small budinesses in particular this is the same message we heard from our academic witness at the hearing according to edward i altman a professor of finance at new york university and a leading expert on predicting business failures the devastating effects of reduced profits and high interest rates that have remained around 20 percent or more for several years are continuing to reduce the ranks of our smaller firm population because of high interest rates pro fessor altman continued businesses today pay more than 40 cents of each dollar of cash flow for interest charges up from 20 cents of 4 years ago no wonder so many marginal firms are succumbing to the economic reality of bankruptcy he said this is unfair small business relies almost exclusively on banks for financing they cannot shop around or bargain for the best interest rates as can large corporations many small businesses are paying at least prime rate or above prime for their loans that means close to 20 percent interest what makes these rates even more crushing is that the real interest rate is at least 10 percent the highest in recent memory the impact can be seen everywhere joseph w duncan the chief statistician for dun bradstreet presented to the subcommittee his firms latest business failure figures they showed continuing and sharp increases throughout the nation and in all industries the sun belt and mountain states are as hard hit as the farm states midwest and midatlantic region the failures touch not only the weak manufacturing wholesale retail and construction sectors but also the previously strong service industries what does the future hold only more grim numbers and more tragedy the subcommittee was tdid unless the economy improves and interest rates decline significantly i am afraid that the already staggering number of business failures will swell to levels comparable to the early 1930s the normally cautious professor altman predicted in 1932 the nadir of the great depression 31 822 businesses failed for a catastrophic failure rate of 154 per 10 000 listed companies the risk he added is that increased business failures will lead banks to tighten credit further and thus accelerate the business failure spiral if banks ration credit to only the most creditworthy firms professor altman said the marginal firm will stand little chance of surviving it is also probably true that the marginal firm is oftentimes also a small firm todays problem goes beyond high interest rates the problem stems from the mix of economic and fiscal policies currently being followed that have driven our nations economy into the worse recession since world war ii and created the severest liquidity crisis for business since the great depression as professor altman warned the real risk is not whether the economy will turn around and stage a recovery but how long the recovery will last if the turnaround is relatively short like the one we experienced in late 1980 then thousands of firms particularly smaller ones will not have sufficient time to get back on a positive cash flow basis the consequences are obvious and ominous we will see a ripple effect throughout the economy as failing large companies topple small firms doing business with them thousands of people will lose their jobs this is happening right now unitedstates trustee james eichstaedt of los angeles told the subcommittee that the bankruptcy last april of the wickes cos the large retail chain has cost several thousands jobs and seriously squeezed the small firms that did business with wickes with so many large unitedstates companies in such desperate financial straits we can count on it happening again and again and again if new economic and fiscal policies are not adopted that will bring interest rates down to affordable and stable levels and encourage the economy to grow e"], [0.001618027687072754, 0.9983819723129272, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i come here today to propose a dramatic action by congressthe elimination of the fe ab the f alb is a thirdclass plane with a firstclass price tag study after study and report after report shows we are not getting our moneys worth the f alb is siphoning precious dollars away from vital defense systems the money we are wasting on the f alb could be put to much better use the amendment which i am offering is long overdue my amendment would prohibit the use of any authorized funds for the procurement research development testing and evaluation of the f alb it does not delete any funds the money targeted for the p alb would be available for other aircraft programs which meet our real defense needs this amendment addresses a pentagon pipedream of a souped up super technological fighter which is hidden in a hazy world of misplaced priorities and misplaced loyalties to a plane rather than to the defense of these united states these loyalties moreover are to a plane that does not stand the test of its original promise orprojections in 1975 congress approved a lowcost lowperformance alternative for the navy and marine corps this was the f alb today we have a high cost lowperformance edsel hidden in a smokescreen thrown up by dod but even through the smokescreen we can see one thing risingthe exorbitant costs for the f alb it is not as if there arc no alternatives to the p a18 one part of the defense smokescreen consists of stonewalling by the department one year ago congress heard the plaintive voice of dod proclaim that there were no alternatives to fulfill the four roles envisioned for the f alb since then the marine corps has eagerly embraced the av8b the light attack role while the navy has gladly accepted a policy of f14 squadrons for all its big deck aircraft carriers there are two roles remaining for the f ala the navy light attack and the marine corps fighter but once again dod is wailing that there are no alternatives available in the best traditions of stonewalling the navy has even gone so far as to deny that it has conducted studies of f alb alternatives however i have in hand three studies conducted by the navy on alternatives to the p ala studies which indicate that the alternatives are not only feasible but preferable let me quote from these socalled nonexistent navy studies on the light attack mission one study states the f18 represents major degradation in our attack capability as compared to present aircraft with f18s designed payload 4 rockeycs a7 radius of action is twice as far with four times the f18s design load the a6 radius of action is twice as far many targets that might be critical could not be reached with fis for targets that the fi8 could reach its smaller payload would require more attack aircraft exposure to enemy defenses although the fpis is faster in a fighter configuration than either a6 or a7 it is not supersonic nor significantly faster when carrying weapons and if adequate fuel is provided to allow the fl8 to leave the target at supersonic speeds after weapon delivery the f18s usable weapon payload is even further degraded this same report addresses the marine fighter mission and says the remaining prospective f18 mission is the marine corps fighter mission since the p14 is probably more capable than is necessary for the classic marine corps air defense mission the f18 appears an adequate replacement for marine f4s however the tradeoff is between providing the f14 and greater fighter capability versus providing a less capable av8b3 fighter variant that would offer support logistic advantages plus the tactical advantages of an allvstoi marine corps fighter and lightattack force the navy would still like to claim that the f alb is essential to the future effectiveness of the navy and marine corps but their own analysis reveals that the analyses of alternative aircraft procurement strategies recently forwarded by cnm chief of naval material to cno chief of naval operations show that the navy can more fully satisfy its aircraft requirements and more rapidly build up toward 15 air wings if the f18 is cancelled 11 4448 co and a7s or a6s used for the navy attack aircraft the effectiveness analysis shows that it would also result in a more effective force it is difficult to make a case on cost or effectiveness grounds for continuance of the p18 program in further unqualified support of the f ala the f alb program manager admitted at a recent press conference that the f14 was a better fighter than the f ala and that the a6 was a better attack plane the prime rationale for the f alb is not the aircrafts necessity rather the department of defense supports the f ala because of its supposed affordability i submit to my colleagues that nearly anything is affordable at 40 billion our military personnel could have calvin klein designer uniforms at that price but i doubt if it would enhance our defense capabilities are we to allow the navy and the department of defense to continue their spendthrift ways on the f ala and bankrupt other more essential naval programs the problems with this plane are many it has a limited radius half that of the a7 the acceleration threshold had to be reduced to meet the planes true capabilities it has not yet completed the mandated two lifetime fatigue test nor have the alloys added to the engine as a result of a crash been tested however these problems significant in any other plane pale in comparison to the continued cost escalation of the f a18 this aircraft was originally purchased because it was supposed to give us the quantity of aircraft the navy needs it was supposed to be a low cost daylightonly aircraft the f a18 got its first taste of megabucks with the addition of radar missiles in 1974 since then the addiction of the navy to goldplating has taken hold of the f ala aircraft however the navy is now showing selfrestraint recent costcutting measures for the f ala include the substitution of aluminum for silver in the detonating cords to explode the canopy i am glad but surprised that only aluminum will suffice with a near 40 billion price tag i would have thought that the cords should have been made of gold to match the plane with spending of this sort is it any wonder that the program has grown in cost so that despite an increase in the quantity of the dod purchase the unit cost has doubled in 5 years the navy claims that the cost growth is strictly due to inflation however this claim simply does not stand the test of careful analysis recently most members received information comparing program costs of the f ala to those of its contemporary the f16 this information demonstrated that the f a18s costs have increased nearly three times as much as the f18s the f alb and the fl6 had contract awards 4

central america i do so in a special order because i believe it is important for members of this body from time to time to step away from the pressures of daily debate and reflect more broadly on the issues before us no issue requires that kind of sober reflection more urgently than this crisis in our foreign policy i rise as a critic of current unitedstates policy while proclaiming a commitment to peace and democracy the administration continues to pursue a policy that by its very nature is incapable of securing either of these goals for the administrations policy is essentially a military policy based on a narrow ideological conception of the regions problems and prospects it is a policy that refuses to acknowledge the mistakes of the past and fs thus left without a realistic vision of the future while calling for demilitarization and an end to aggression in central america the administration continues to place arms at the disposal of some of the most ruthless forces in the region the united states has provided hundreds of milions of dollars in military aid to el salvador to a government which even ourown ambassador acknowledges continues flagrant violations of its own citizens human rights todays ap will provide a graphic and all too familiar example la plorida el salvador masita ruiz says the killers came at midnight firing machine guns and swinging machetes as she and her children lay quivering in their clay hovel the gang dragged seven screaming peas ants from neighboring huts stabbed them in the chest and face and hacked them to death in an orgy of blood before departing ms ruiz and about 12 other witnesses told an ap reporter i heard the screams and the shots she said the next day they found their bodies all cut up the heavily armed gang had stormed into the 600acre cooperative farm in la flo ta where ms ruiz and about 300 other peasants lived the date was nov 20 nobody knows who did it and why but the atrocity bore the markings of rightwing paramilitary gangs which terrorize civilians to keep them from associating with leftist rebels after the murders work stopped at la florida in the foothills of santa ana province 52 miles northwest of san salvador frightened villagers began to flee ms ruiz said she gathered her 10 children and went to live with relatives 12 miles away in santa ana city where she was interviewed the victims between 29 and 59 years old appeared to have been felled by a machete whack on the nape of the neck the la florida villagers said the killers slit the throats of three victims repeatedly stabbed them sliced off the nose of another victim and sexually mutilated him stunned negihbors buried the bodies a few days latter in makeshift graves by the road side where the victims died caked pools of blood marked the killing ground an officer at the santa ana army garrison denied the army was involved in the killing police authorities said they had no information and refused to elaborate unitedstates military aid to honduras has multiplied in the last year and threatens to destabilize a country where newly formed democratic institutions are struggling to maintain autonomy from the traditionally overpowering military costa rica a democratic nation that has long foresworn the desire for a large standing army has been pressured by the united states to strengthen its arsenal now president reagan raises the specter of military aid to guatemala a country whose brutal military regimes have earned it the condemnation of the world the folly of this policy can be illustrated by examining some of the events of the past year evidence has been accumulating fot nearly a year showing that the united states is involved in an escalating covert campaign a secret war aimed at nicaragua earlier this year the washington post reported that president reagan authorized 19 million for the cia to advise train and arm paramilitary forces along the honduran nicaraguan border at a minimum and without going beyond what the administration has cnceded the purpose of this operation was to stop the flow of arms across that border and to engage in hit and run raids to sabotage to harrass the nicaraguan government there is reason to fear that the operation has gone far beyond that it has brought the united states into a working arrangement with former members of president somozas national guard who are committed to the violent overthrow of the nicaraguan government this is a sordid alliance with people who promise a massacre in nicaragua and who boast that when they return to power there will be bodies from the border to managua the uprooted the wounded and the dead in nicaragua bear painful witness to the thrust of this campaign scores of nicaraguans have been killed and others have fled the region as guerrilla bands sweep down on isolated villages although still abetted by the united states the actions of these paramilltary forces have gained momentum beyond unitedstates control let us be clear unitedstates support for covert activities against nicaragua endangers not just the security of nicaragua but of the united states it poses issues with respect to the united states actual interest in central america and with respect to the process of forming unitedstates foreign policy to oppose unitedstates support for these covert activities is not to proclaim that the nicaraguan government is without problems and there clearly is a need for that government to encourage economic and political pluralism it is merely to proclaim that unitedstates policy in the region should not be formed through the implications of covert activities these activities commit us to a specific foreign policy that has never been openly defended and supported and whose outcome cannot be guided by our own democractic institutions a few days ago congress voiced vigorous dissent from this policy by voting unanimously to prohibit funding to any paramilitary group for the purpose of overthrowing the government of nicaragua i would like to ex press my admiration to mr harkin and others for thel leadership on this issue and to mr boland chairman of the select committee on intelligence for his clear expressions of concern and his dedication to the vigorous oversight of the consequences both in tended and unintended of unitedstates covert operations this policy is not just an isolated case rather it displays in microcosm the fundamental flaws of unitedstates policy throughout the region the united states may have started with a limited goalto end the alleged flow of cubansupplied arms across the honduran nicaraguan border but to do this required an alliance with groups like the somoscitas who have an agenda of their own we have thus become accomplices to acts of aggression against nicaragua and allies of groups committed to unmitigated cruelties this pattern has been repeated again and again as in the guise of fighting a communist threat the united states stakes its prestige on repressive military regimes whose actions we cannot endorse control or even mnbderate instead of heeding the lessons of past and present errors in unitedstates policy the administration seems determined to repeat them this is nowhere more evident than in president reagans recent embrace of guatemalas gen rios montt if the administration resumes military aid to guatemala it will not on1 be flaunting an explicit agreemenc to obtain congressional approval beforehand it will be ignoring the overwhelming evidence concerning the atrocities committed by the guatemalan government in guatemalas countryside rios montt has adopted a sophisticated and ruthless counterinsurgency campaign including a scorchedearth policy that destroys the base of rural livelihood and forces the peasants to flee the country or to camps under military control amnesty international estimates that 2 600 civilians have died in massacres since rios montt came to power americas watch has charged that by adopting a policy of total war and by abandoning the rule of law the rios montt government has become responsible for the consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights in guatemala on the mere promise that rios montt will announce electoral laws president reagan extols the guatemalan leaders commitment to democracy yet since july 1 guatemala has been under an officially declared state of seige which prohibits political and union activity requires private gatherings to be approved by the defense minister allows military authorities to detain anyone suspected of disturbing public order permits home searches without a warrant places severe restrictions on the press and creates special military tribunals to try those accused of violating the state of siege neither the promise of elections nor elections themselves will guarantee peace or even democracy to guatemala guatemala has had elections before for 30 years these have been controlled by the military and ridden with fraud in the past decade political opponents of the left and center have been mercilessly eliminated to talk of including a broad spectrum of participants in the electoral process is to ignore guatemalas past and present conditions have we forgotten that last march rios montt came to power by deposing a military leader chosen through just such an electoral process have we forgotten that only a year ago the state department assured us these elections would be a democratic solution for guatemala if the united states provides military aid to rios montt now it will only feed the climate of violence and intimidation which poisons the prospects for democracy in guatemala again the guatemalan case is not an isolated one but has broader implications that go to the heart of our understanding of democracy democracy cannot be reduced to a simple formula or to the simple ritual of elections it must rise from the hearts minds and experience of the people themselves it cannot be imposed by fiat from above we in the united states must never fall to recall that our own route to democracy was not without struggle or bloodshed and that the building of our own democratic institutions was not accomplished in a year or even a decade while expressing satisfaction with a mere skeleton of democratic procedures the administration has wasted opportunities for a genuine political solution to the conflicts of the region and has discarded chances to play a role in a concrete peace process last spring when mexican president lopez portillo offered to serve as an intermediary among the conflicting factions throughout the region the reagan administration let the offer die after a few meetings between our secretary of state and the ivexican foreign minister this fall when the presidents of mexico and venezuela made a unique joint appeal to president reagan and the heads of state of honduras and nicaragua the united states showed only rhetorical interest instead the administration quickly used a meeting of central american governments which did not include nicaragua mexico or venezuelato endorse its own conditions for dialog and declared this to be the only future forum for considering peace proposals i have long believed that regional cooperation provides the key to resolving the problems of central america countries such as mexico and venezuela are far better equipped than the united states to understand the particularities of each country and to bring together the forces necessary to secure a lasting peace the events of the last year have underscored this clearly and the administration has yet to provide a convincing rationale for ignoring and undercutting these promising peace initiatives recently there have been some auspicious signs from the administration much was gained from the presidents trip to latin americahis new respect for the individuality of each nation and his emphasis on the overriding importance of economic development i hope these themes will guide unitedstates policy in the future like many of my colleagues i have the deepest respect for george shultz whose habits of careful decisionmaking and consensus planning promise great change in our attitudes to central america secretary shultz needs and deserves time time to slowly move unitedstates policy from the ideological rut plowed by secretary haig time to implement changes of policy in a way that does not produce abrupt and unsettling tilts instead of secure progress nonetheless the administration continues to display a peculiarly onesided ability to see and support progress while mere promises of future elections make the guatemalan regime a friend of democracy fully implemented land reform programs in nicaragua evidently mean nothing while meagerly substantiated accusations of human rights abuses in nicaragua make the sandinistas the regions leading proponent of genocide the continued documented massacres in guatemala are chalked up apparently to reasons of state let us be honest and straightforward few regimes in central america are without their problems the ability of the united states to perceive subtle distinctions and support shades of progress is the key to a mature for eign policy but these subtleties must be carefully defined carefully supported and applied uniformerly or unitedstates policy becomes blind support for any regime cloaked in anticommunism the united states must be able to see and support progress on the left as well as the right and it has to be said on the left perhaps more than the right there is no overlooking the history of the region and given that history there is no mature foreign policy that does not recognize and address the revolutionary potential of the region the mexicans are want to say that each central american country must fact its own revolution and while i might dissent from their determinism their point is valid the history of colonialism repression and poverty in region that will find expression in radical politics democracy is the key to the regions future but the assertion of that ideal has to be wedded to a real program for helping each country on its road to democracy the united states has to find a way to remain close to and to influence countries as they move through rapid programs of social progress this is the fundamental foreign policy task for the united states in central america"], [0.0017030835151672363, 0.9982969164848328, 1, "once agali we are confronted with a budgetthe latta budgetthat slashes funding for our nations health programs we should not be fooled by the rhetoric surrounding this budgetthe revisions do not alleviate the devastating impact of the cuts on our nations most vulnerable citizensthey just shift them to those less able to afford it this latta budget slashes programs for the poor this latta budget is a disaster this latta budget is no improvement over the latta proposal we rejected just 2 weeks ago latta continues to propose deep cuts in health of 4 9 billion in fiscal year 1983 and 20 7 billion over 3 years while they talk about restoring the medicare cuts they still propose to cut social securitys medicare program by 3 2 billion in fiscal year 1983 that may be considered a restoration for those who proposed the irresponsibly absurd level of cuts in the last latta bill but it is in fact a deep cuta cut that will require us to shift even more costs to the aged and disabled medicare beneficiaries how do they finance this socalled restoration one way is by drastic cuts in medicald shifting even more costs to the states on top of the federal cuts we enacted last year and cutting funding for children the aged poor and those in nursing homes finally they have done nothing to improve their earlier proposal for flrt funding for discretionary health programs for 3 full years the result will be a severe cut in real purchasing power for biomedical research and critical public health programs lets look at these proposals in more detail they propose a 3 2 billion cut in medicare and for that they are trying to take credit for how nicely they are treating medicare the fact that that is an improvement over their last proposal simply highlights how ridiculous their last proposal was 3 2 billion is a deep cutand our aged and disabled constituents will not be fooled by rhetoric about restorations when their annual deductible increases under this proposal they will not be fooled when their cost sharing for home health services increases under this proposal they will not be fooled when they pay more and more out of pocket for physician services to make up for lattas arbitrary cuts in physician payments so i urge my colleagues not to be fooled by this rhetoricfurther shifts of costs to the elderly are unwarranted medicare is already so restrictive that it pays just 45 percent of the health bill of the aged we should not endorse this proposal that shifts this administrations budget problem to the aged person needing medical care for medicaid the latta budget is even worse apparently the designers of latta made a rather cynical decision to give to the aged with one hand by restoring a limited portion of the medicare cut while taking away with the other hand from those aged who are the very poorest by slashing the medicaid program let us look at these medicaid cuts in detail just last year medicaid was cut severely and those cutsof nearly a billion dollars a yearwere extended for 3 full years states are now desperately trying to cope with this years cat they face a further cut of 4 percent that is already programed into fiscal year 1983 now latta proposes a new cut of 1 3 billiona cut even larger than the controversial proposal we enacted last year more than 1 billion of this cut is nothing more than a pure shift of costs to the statesi think we all know that the states cannot afford this shift on top f the cuts we enacted last year i have sent to each of you preliminary estimates of what these cuts cost each statebut let me provide some examples to give you a sense of the order of magnitude of this harsh proposal pennsylvania would lose 36 million under two of the latta provisions on top of the 43 million cut already programed into fiscal year 1983total reduction to pennsylvania 79 million illinois would lose 35 million under two of these latta provisions on top of the 32 million reduction they already face going into fiscal year 1983total reduction to illinois 67 million i would be glad to share copies of this state data so that you can see the impact of each of your states the implications are clearthis budget attempts to solve the federal budget problem brought on by this administration by abrogating responsibility for it and shifting it to the states we cannot accept that policy how would the administration achieve these shifts of costs to the states it is interesting to try to determine this every explanation of how the cuts will be achieved changes as soon as the specifics are criticized omb is now in the acttrying to confuse the picture of how the savings will be made they are banking on the fact that by shifting gears every few hours they will fool enough people here so that they can get votes for the latta budget before we in the congress understand what the cuts mean but i do not believe members will be fooled the billions of dollars they intend to cut have not changed and i think we all understand that the real way they intend to achieve these cuts are the ways shown in all the descriptions that accompanied the latta proposal when it was released what were those changes first they would shift 600 million to the states by reducing the current federal medicald matching rate for all socallerl optional services and optional eligibility groups by 3 percentage points this means that states will either have to increase the amount of money they put into medicaid or cut back on current coverage i want everyone to understand who these optional groups are and what these optional services are the op tional eligibility groups are not just the medically needy but include all elderly and disabled persons in nursing homes with income in excess of 25 a month they are considered mandatory eligibles only if they receive less than 25 per month from all sources these are the people latta defines as optional for purposes of cutting federal funds under medicald states would have their federal support slashed for the large majority of medicaid aged and disabled individuals in nursing homes what are the socalled optional services they include nonskilled nursing home care prescription drugs dental care eyeglasses and hearing aids this 3percentage point cut in matching will force states either to find additional funds of their own or to eliminate coverage for these services and people that is how latta proposes to solve the federal budget problem for our nations discretionary health programs latta proposes flat funding of 8 billion per year for 3 full years real purchasing power will decline and the result will be serious shortfalls in critical programs biomedical research at the national institutes of health will decline funding for important and costeffective programs like childhood immunizations maternal and child health services family planning and nursing programs will be at risk this budget is totally unacceptable for health the aged and disabled medicare beneficiary cannot afford to have this budget pass the states cannot afford to have this budget pass lowincome children aged individuals and nursing home patients cannot afford to have this budget pass our public health efforts cannot afford to have this budget pass i urge all of you

and forcibly brought us to attention today we should ^be saying you have led the way now well proceed many of us would like to claim bold leadership in addressing the issue of cutting government spending we cannot we are following the orders of our constituents who preceded us on this issue we now have the responsibility to carry out those orders congress own committee funding is a good place to start i support the 10percent reduction it is a significant cut yet it would not ii 1091 cripple any necessary committee action we know that some committees and subcommittees should be cut even more others should be cut less or not at all as wielders of the ax we must make discriminate chops statistics documenting the growth of government spending are so numerous as to strain our capacity for retention some point to the growth of congressional staff as a prime example of the ballooning bureaucracy well it is true congressional staff growth and the increase in committee funding levels over the past 10 years is well documented by figures the figures however only address the symptoms the disease itself remains we need to be wary of the quick cure and if we are to be responsive to the budgetcutting demands of our constituents we must look beyond the figures documenting congressional stnff growth to the reasons for this growth there is where the doctoring is really needed one reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the burgeoning bureaucracy in the executive branch executive branch personnel and funding levels have increased enormously over the past two decades new programs have been instituted with corresponding new staffs task forces have been established to study specific problems old programs have been expanded and staffs increased to handle the work load it is quite understandable that congressional committee staffs have increased commensurately just to monitor and conduct oversight investigations of increased executive branch activity we must also cut back the executive bureaucracy president reagan has promised to reduce the size of the federal work force to reduce the size and number of federal programs i believe that he is committed to this kind of a spending cut in the federal bureaucracy when this happens it should be easier for us to also reduce the sizes and budgets of our special committee staffs responsible for doing the work generated by some of these executive agencies another important reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the legislative reorganization act of 1970 this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 320 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 328 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect there will be an attempt here today by the minority to cut committee funding even more than the substantial 10percent cut proposed by the distinguished majority leader anything more than the 10percent cut would be a severe blow to the efficiency of the house committee system the purpose for such a cut is more than simply to spend less money we know that the senate now controlled by the minority has not seen fit to cut its own committee funding to this extent we know that the senate and the white house while being budget conscious in spending levels for their own staffs are still leaving themselves sufficient funds to carry out their mandated duties efficiently at the same time though there are those who would demand that the house sustain a burden of budget cutting greater than its share to the possible detriment of its efficiency and its ability to do its job i can only assume that this effort is a partisan one designed more to hamper the effectiveness of a house still with a democratic majority than to be responsive and responsible to the budgetcutting demands of the american public our president has told us that the issue of reducing federal spending at all levels is nonpartisan our constituents tell us the issue is nonpartisan commonsense tells us the issue is nonpartisan yet the structure of our committee system created by the reorganization act of 1970 makes it partisan as do some of the

its economy but rather a lot of pandering that in the long run proves to be harmful to our future this was the case recently on a vote regarding a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of congress that funding appropriated for title v of the older americans act the senior community service employment project should be maintained in future years at the level necessary to insure that its current jobs and other services be maintained or expanded on the surface this resolution sounded magnanimous and full of compassion for our fine elderly citizens as could have been expected it passed by an overwhelming margin in the house i voted against it for several reasons first i do not dispute the intrinsic worth of a senior community service program i am well aware that our older citizens have much to offer their communities and nation and that too often they are shunted aside by the now generation my concern centers around which segment of government should finance such a program with a budget deficit of more than 100 billion this year it should be obvious that the federal government does not have the money i have absolutely no objection to programs of this nature and local and state governments and perhaps private enterprise might wish to consider maintaining and expanding this program state and local governments generally have to operate within balanced budgets lack the massive moneyabsorbing bureaucracy of the federal government and allow local people to have more control over their own programs second it is pure hypocrisy for congress to decry massive budget deficits and overspending by the federal government and to sponsor balanced budget amendmentswhile at the same time playing to the grandstand with proposals that add to the federal deficit third it is wildly inaccurate to claim that federal progrpms pay for themselves and do not end up costing the taxpayers if overspending by the federal government paid for itself as is claimed for virtually every domestic program contained within the budget we would not have 100 billion deficits or trillion dollar national debts today fourth such resolutions are in themselves meaningless because congress will either appropriate the funds or it will not therefore one must assume that the purpose of such proposals is simply another liberal ploy to encourage partisan and philosophical demagoguery prior to the november general elections liberalsand many conservatives are quite aware that they will be painted as ogres haters of the elderly and uncompassionate individuals if they vote against such grand sounding proposals fifth spending on the federal level for this and similar programs actually worsens the lot of those it is designed ostensibly to help federal overspending robs the elderly and forces their backs against the wall by creating inflation inflation destroys the purchasing power of the elderly more than any other group because so many are dependent on fixed incomes so while the seen hand of federal largesse may have the public relations image of helping the elderly the unseen hand of federal deficits debt and inflation soon destroys any positive effects that earlier help may have had sixth such resolutions actually make prostitutes of many politicians becaue they in effect sell their votes for the programs in return for the votes of specific groups on election day in other words the unspoken agreement is that the various lobbing groups will urge their member to vote for congressman x because he voted for the program pushed by that lobbying group the problem is that the money of current taxpayersand future taxpayers considering the national debtis being used to buy the votes finally this process and the lack of courage on the part of many politicians are the reasons why our nation is in such an awful economic mess today we must realize the federal government cannot give something to anyone or any group that it has not first taken away from someone else this is especially true where deficit spending is concerned because it obligates money from future taxpayers with our national defenses desperately in need of rapid rebuildingit has been postponed for
