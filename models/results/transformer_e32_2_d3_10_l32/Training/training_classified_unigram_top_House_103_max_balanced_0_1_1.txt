people are watching and you are about to witness one of the most outrageous charades ever attempted on the floor of this house here are 432 pages of testimony of conscientious members of this house republicans and democrats who have been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership 40some denied their rights on the floor of this house you are about to see the taxers the spenders the regulators who control this house the democrat leadership attempt to convince you and the american people that the bill that pays for the operation of this congress has been substantially reduced i get so exercised when i see this mr speaker and members that is an outrageous charade this bill does not reduce spending on we the congress it does not reduce spending by 20 percent by 10 percent by 5 percent not even 2 percent this bill authorizes spending on we the congress of 1 800 000 000 almost 2 billion and yes the taxers and the spenders and the regulators who run this place have magnanimously cut this legislative budget by about 1 percent well isnt that big of them what do you think about that mr and mrs america typically president clinton and the democrat leadership are attempting to foist on the american people the largest tax increase in american history forcing each american family to cough up at least 800 per year in new taxes forcing every american family to tighten their belts yet these same democrats continue on their drunken spending spree refusing to cut their own budgets and even worse through this gag rule refusing to let rankandfile republicans and democratsand here they are democrats look at them you have been slapped by your democrat leadershiprefusing to allow republicans or democrats to even offer amendments that would significantly cut our legislative budget why is this a charade it is a charade because the democrat leadership in an 11thhour rules meeting yesterday kidded 40some members democrats and republicans alikehere they arewho came to us pleading to let them offer significant cutting amendments to the bill why is this a charade mr speaker because after listening to all of these members recite what their constituents were saying back home cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending the democratcontrolled rules committee turned down on a partyline vote all 46 of the significant cutting amendments offered by republicans and democrats alike amendments that would have cut several hundred million dollars from this bloated legislative expense budget that continues to hire 37 000 employees which i think is lust to make us look good why is this a charade mr speaker because after refusing to allow any of the significant cutting amendments to be offered and debated on this floor the democrat leadership in a cute little ployand you just heard it recited by the manager herein a cute little ploy made in order six small amendments have you people listened to it up there do you know what those six small amendments were for they were good amendments but none of them individually or in total significantly reduce this legislative budget to show you what a charade this gag rule really is and why i am so exercised and why the american people are going to be so exercised if all six of these amendments pass all six that were magnanimously made in order which my good friend the gentleman from texas has said they were really gracious in allowing all these amendments if all six were allowed to pass they would not even cut our legislative budget by a tenth of 1 percent that means that congress this year will continue to spend on itself almost the same amount that it always has while socking it to the taxpayers of this nation to portray this legislative budget as a costcutting bill is a charade the american people have had enough they have had it with a congress that continues to raise their taxes so that they can spend the money on themselves that is exactly what we are doing here they have had it with a congress that continues to pass laws that regulate the american people but exempt the congress exempt themselves they have had it with you they have had it with a democrat leadership that refuses to allow rank and file republicans or democrats to offer amendments that would do what their constituents sent them here to do this year cut spending cut spending cut spending i cannot say it enough cut spending especially cut spending on themselves mr speaker and members i urge defeat of the rule so that democrats like the gentleman from minnesota a good conservative democrat most conscientious member on your side of the aisle and another democrat the gentleman from utah another very good member who has been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership and refused to be able to come on this floor and offer their significant amendments that would cut millions out of this budget and lord knows we can afford to cut millions out of this budget so that our republican leader the gentleman from illinois could offer his amendment which could cut anywhere between 12 and 25 percent you know they deserve the right to be able to come to this floor and do that mr speaker and members of this house that is what the american people want but it is what the democrat leadership does not want members who are you for are you for the democrat leadership or are you for the american people on behalf of the american people vote down this rule and let these members come on this floor and do what they were sent here to do represent their people i include the

in flight i am even wearing my wright brothers tie tonight there is nothing more frustrating here than having to interrupt your thoughts as the clock is chasing you i want to continue what i have just loosely called the clinton years part 3 and begin tonight with something from yesterdays wall street journal that i found very disturbing it is a description of the fine state of arkansas that matches something i tried to describe in this well in september and in october of the election year 1992 there is a newsletter that has just come into my possession by kevin phillips published by the american political research corporation it is called the american political report the headline is whitewater the politics of a second watergate when you say this to anyone in the dominant media culture who is a gentleman and admits they are liberal a lady of the same honor and they are rare most of them claim that they are perched on some olympian peak of moderate perfection when you mention in the same breath whitewater or watergate or refer to whitewater as white watergate as does the great columnist for the new york times bill safire they go ballistic on you here are some of the subtitles in kevin phillips american political report clinton whitewater and the polls and the polls are moving severely against mr clinton the clinton scandals a 20th century political perspective i will come back to that the hillary rodham factor the clinton scandals in the midterm elections that is a fascinating part 4 june congressional hearings on whitewater it may be a lot sooner than june after what happened in this house today by a vote of 408 to 15 the house of representatives the peoples great chamber has joined that 98 to 0 vote in the unitedstates senate to start hearings as soonas possible six clinton legal vulnerabilities this is a nightmare for the white house obstruction of justice shredding of evidence intimidating or offering payment to witnesses or offering promotions jobs to arkansas troopers which was not mentioned in there this is under that heading number 6 of legal vulnerabilities whitewater illegal financial dealings troopergate there it is good kevin sexual harassment wrongful death conspiracy then category 7 a clinton vulnerability scenario that is truly a nightmare number 8 impeachment possibilities the big i word finally in print albeit in a newsletter number 9 the clinton scandals and the impact on 96 and then under the headline of the national politics it says clinton job approval it gives time yankelovich nbc gallup usa today singlinger these are all about a week to 2 weeks old they are all dropping let us just take a look at the headlines in the news magazines i misplaced unitedstates news world report but mort zuckermans publication is just as tough as this newsletter here is time magazine it is a jungle out there the administration is in retreat embarrassed by new disclosures unable to head off congressional probes remember this went to bed 4 days ago here is the newsweek headline clintons bleak house bill clinton looking to combat his whitewater blues the president made a flurry of spirited public appearances last week including pounding on a podium in the immature stridently saying no nine times more about that in a second hillary rodham clinton the first lady found her own medicine in a trip to denver to sell the white house health tare pla3l still stalling or as one columnist observed a modified hangout watergate term stunned by more bad news the president tries to change the subject tonight on all three networks particularly on cbs they devoted about 10 minutes on the cbs show to all of the various whitewater stories breaking today on abc they described the vote of this house today to hold hearings as the democrats conceded to and then the reporter took a deliberate dramatic pause and said to do the best we could because we do not have specific dates yet or anything really substantial on whenwe are going to have the hearings the los angeles times which remember has 4 of the arkansas 10 troopers that were talking 4 on tape recording here is the l a times of yesterday a story correctly predicting what would happen today in little rock exmunicipal judge accused of fraud tries to implicate clinton david hales trial begins next week in a case related to whitewater of course he plea bargained today interesting that the unitedstates attorney down there in little rock paula casey could have had him plea bargain months ago this all would be much further advanced maybe some of it is resolved to the clintons satisfaction if she had not stonewalled former judge david hales offer to plea bargain and tell all and then after she had stopped him and demanded that he go to trial then she recused herself as having a biased background on the whole whitewater mess here is todays l a times clinton treasury aide given early briefing on failed arkansas thrift political appointee roger altman was told that the madison guaranty s l case would go to the justice department he is also a regulator raising a possible conflict beneath that another story republicans had planned to raise the whitewater issue at hearings on thursday chairman gonzalez who has called for the impeachment of a sitting president 3 times in the 12 reagan and bush years my friend henry gonzalez instead calls for a select panel to probe the controversial matter we do not know if that 408 to 15 vote today is going to grow into a select panel but if it does it will be more of a jungle out there for the white house as a matter of fact when i pick up the papers these days an old beatles tune always rings in my head i saw the news today oh boy now here is the wall street journal yesterday rose law firm will file ethics complaint in arkansas about hubbells expenses that is webster hubbell best golf buddy of bill clinton the rose law firm has decided to file a complaint with the arkansas ethics authorities about undocumented expenses incurred by former associate attorney general webster hubbell how can they blame that on the republicans of course they cannot it is impossible as i said in my special orders last week walk out the hall here a few steps to the statutory hall which was the house chamber for 50 years from 1807 to 1857 and statue number 7 around to your left in between jeffersn davis the senator from mississippi who became the president of the 10 breakaway confederate states and on the other side is robert fulton of steamboat invention fame and there is one of the two statues from arkansas that every state is allowed to put in this incredible building the worlds greatest governmental building ever there is the distinguished face and form of uriah rose the founder of the rose law firm an appointee to the geneva convention at the turn of the century around 1908 by 1908 president teddy roosevelt was the first president of the american bar association and that rose firm was the first firm west of the mississippi when arkansas was just a frontier state it is really tragic what has happened to the 60 partners down there now that they are going to find themselves possibly as some columnists suggest in a state of bankruptcy within months what a tragedy that the four partners coming to washington what is now being called the gang of four hillary rodham webster hubble vince foster dead since july 20 and now william kennedy william kennedy hi no relation to the massachusetts kennedy family here is the wall street journal article from today kennedy clintons ethics gatekeeper hasnt paid taxes on nannys wages before white house associate counsel william kennedy 3i became a clinton gatekeeper on ethical issues he worked for nussbaum who has resigned under a cloud who had on his desk a parody of james carville clintons campaign managers theme sign about staying on message it is the economy stupid and nussbaum had on his desk it is the ethics stupi that sign must have fallen on its face when they were all conducting these midnight raids into vince fosters office it says kennedy became a clinton gatekeeper on ethics yet he had a hidden problem of his own unpaid taxes owed on a nannys wages but he disclosed it to only one person in the clinton camp surprise surprise vincent foster the deputy white house counsel who died july 20th notice very few of the papers say committed suicide they say alleged suicide or who died i may be naive but i am still clinging to the theory of suicide because anything else is so shakespearian i will be on this floor if there is ever a murder or even an indication of the body being moved i will be on this floor calling for the resignation merciful resignation of the clinton team from the white house that is for sure here is the headline of the distinguished washington times gonzalez gives in calls for hearings hale might hold pieces to the whitewater puzzle grand jury likely to hear of clintons depis it is interesting that hale might be the john dean of this breaking scandal the first one who comes forward and tells all to save himself dean went to jail it looks like hale if going to jail for 10 years maybe with good behavior he will get 5 but this thing grows exponentially here is a column i meant to put in the record from last week when i spoke on st patricks day and the following day in defense of arkansas it says it is time to come to thedefense of arkansas recently maligned with an image of a closeknit political circle of mutual back scratching in this department little rock as nothing on washington dc with webb hubble leaving the justice department jamie gorelick is about to arrive ms gorelicks nomination which went before the senate last week was fascinating because of all the people she has defended clark clifford and robert altman not roger no relation i believe i had better check that out on the first american bank where they worked when it was secretly owned by the bank of credit and commerce international or bccl one of the largest banking scandals in this country guess what i found out who writes these fascinating articles in the wall street journal it is robert bartley he was unflappable on meet the press sunday before the guns of david broder and company he has said to folks that since mlichael kingsley and others accused him on nightline excuse me on crossfire and in print in the new republic that he was one of the proximate causes of a suicide namely vince foster that he said what do these people expect me to do dry up and blow away or to defend my honor here is an article that i think is going to be probably the most quoted over the next months from what i have always goodnaturedly called a schizophrenic magazine because most of the reporters are liberal like michael kingsley and yet fred barnes is one of its senior editors and that is the new republic wait until i read what the new republic says about the scandals interlocking in arkansas by l j davis here it is so powerful it is quoted in a long editorial the longest i have seen yet in any paper in the wall street journal obviously written by robert bartley and i will cut to the chase here and read the part that fascinated me because i had said the same thing on the house floor over 1 year and 7 months ago arkansas mr davis l j davis writes in the new republic a liberal moderate magazine there is a close resemblance to a third world country with a ruling oligarchy a small and relatively powerless middle class a disenfranchised leaderless populace the wall street journal says this kind of civic culture we see in many actual third world countries i have witnessed it all through the torments of central and south america over many trips down there when i was on the committee on foreign affairs a decade ago we see this kind as likely to produce a spoilstothevictor abovethelaw approach to government that is to say the kind of careless arrogance we have seen in the handling of whitewater in the white house passes in webb hubbles law firm billings in travelgate in intervention into an ongoing corruption trial in the handling of vince fosters death and in the handling of various individuals including zoe baird kimba wood lannie gunier and chris emory a white house usher dismissed over phone conversations with barbara bush over how to set up her computer home laptop computer with no warning and less than a weeks notice chris emory longtime white house usher turned into the street whitewater is not merely about a land deal the wall street journal continues it is about all of these things and about the place they are bidding the clintons to assume in washington which god knows is guilty of enough sins of its own and above all it is about hypocrisy say that one after another the explanations are innocent hilary was lucky in commodities and unlucky in land speculation wishing they had lost money jim blair and patsy thomason are just friends she was on the hill today more about that later james and susan macdougal and david hale and dan lassiter are just former friends lay aside all suspicions and accept every cover story we are now supposed to believe that bill clinton was elected president to reform the sins of the highflying 1980s yes the key word there is hypocrisy here is something that my friend senator doi nickles sent over he is chairman of the senate republican policy committee as i have been chairman for 2 years over here a few years ago of the republican study committee he sent over documentation that i would like to include in the record at this point about all of the 25 separate allegations of ethical or legal wrongdoing that were turned into hearings and or investigations during the reagan and bush administration despite the presence of at least five separate instances or allegations of wrong during the clinton administration and senator nickles lists them congress has yet to conduct a single hearing or the slightest investigation on three occasions during the reagan administration congressional committees conducted investigations or hearings concurrent with investigations by an independent counsel four of 19 congressional hearings or investigations conducted during the reagan administration were led by the thenrepublican controlled committees of the united states senate which was from 1981 through 1986 under republican control a recent opinion poll revealed that 60 percent of those surveyed believe whitewater requires a fullscale federal investigation here are the areas where republicans in the senate feel there should be or should have been investigations scandal one travelgate i have here an article a good column by mark r levin that says whatever happened to travelgate why did that disappear this is last week he opens up with a memorandum from william j clinton to all the heads of departments and agencies just a few months ago october 4 1993 the freedom of information act has been one of the primary means by which members of the public inform themselves about their government federal departments and agencies should handle requests for information in a customerfriendly manner the use of the act by ordinary citizens is not complicated nor should it be the existence of unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles has no place in its irpplementation"],

congress the budget proposal offered by the democrats is a recipe for economic and fiscal disaster it proposes to increase taxes at a time when americans are already overtaxed it proposes to increase taxes at a itime when we have a fragile economy higher taxes will only stifle job creation and economic growth it proposes to continue the path of excessive govemnment spending excessive spending is the reason our federal government is currently saddled with a massive debt depending on whose estimates you believe bill clinton is proposing to raise taxes anywhere from 250 billion to 315 billion no matter which figure you use if his proposal becomes law it will be the largest tax increase in the history of our nation moreover egardless of the exact figures his proposal taxes everyone from the small business owner to the social security recipient to the working middle income american family and we thought mr clinton was only going to sock it to the rich it is an absolute outrage that a man who actually promised middle american taxpayers a tax cut during the campaign can now turn around and unblushingly pr6pose to raise taxes in a magnitude of historic proportions mr clintons assertion that the reason he must now raise taxes is because the deficit figure is higherthan he anticipated during the campaign is quite frankly bull in fact last july during the campaign clinton predicted even higher deficitsup to 40u billionthan actually materialized moreover democrat budget committee members advising clinton during the campaign and working with their good friends at the congressional budget office certainly were well aware of what to expect in the way of deficit figures most conspicuous among those members is leon panetta former chairman of the housebudget committee and now clintons director of office of management and budget for clinton to rationalize raising taxes based on claims of new deficit figures is the height of hypocrisy this is just another example of mr clinton trying to be slick more importantly regardlessof what the actual deficit figures are t is excessive spending not insufficient tax revenues that has produced our gushing red ink indeed when you combine federal state and local taxes you find that the american taxpayer is already being taxed at alltime record high levels analyzing the federal budget over the past 12 years further drives home thepoint in 1980 revenues to the federal treasury were 500 billion by 1992 revenues had soared to 1 1 trillion a massive 600 billion increase in 12 years in other words in 12 years the american taxpayer shouldered an additional federal tax burden that was greater than the magnitude of the entire tax burden it took us over 200 years to reach one would think that the federal government could do just fine with 600 billion in new tax dollars each year but alas it isnt enough to quench the insatiable thirst of democrats in congress during that same timeframe federal expenditures rose frem 600 billion to nearly 1 4 trillionan increase of 800 billion this simply illustrates the historical fact that for every new dollar the treasury receives in taxes congress spends 1 60 more indeed the 1990 budget deal which had promised spending cuts for every dollar in new taxes instead resulted in congress spending an additional 2 37 for every dollar in new taxes republicans have been willing to make the hard choices and make the spendlng cuts how many times in the past 12 years have i seen this congress on a party ing vote reject republican amendments to trim as little as 1 percent from an appropriation bill how many times have i seen the democratcontrolled rules committee decide to prevent republlcant from offering amendments to cut spending and make economies indeed in that regard i was deeply disappointed that the democrats did not allow my good friend from indiana congressman dan burton to offer his budget freeze proposal i have long been an advocate of an across the board spending freeze mr burrons proposal would have made a bigger dent in the deficit than any of the proposals before us today moreover in my view mr burtons acrosstheboard freeze is the fairest way to spread the burden of spending cutseveryone who benefits from federal spending must tighten the belt however once again in an abuse of their uninterrupted control of the house of representatives for the past 40 years the democrats decided to gag the opposition rather than debate a viable alternative on its merits republicans have proposed viable alternatives and the budget proposal offered by my good fmlend john kasich is the kind of proposal that the american public deserves it proposes no tax increases and will cut the deficit significantly i can only hope that there are democrats in the house that can see the error of mr clintons ways and join republicans in supporting the kasich budget bill clinton has broken his promise to the american people as he has broken so many other promises in his short tenure mr clinton does not understad one basic factamericans are not undertaxedcongress is spending too much in my view bil clinton sold the american voter a bill of goods i am afraid that this president who received only 43 percent of the popular vote and this congress do not understand the nature of the problem as bill clinton should say its spending stupid"],

they have heard about some of the mysterious things that have happened in the investigation into vince fosters death but there is a lot of other interesting things that have happened involving the rose law firm in little rock ar and hillary rodham clinton and the former governor of arkansas bill clinton tonight i would like to talk about two cases involving the failure of two savings and loans and the involvement of the rose law firm and some possible conflicts of interest that should be investigated by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the federal savings and loan insurance corporation as well as the special counsel mr starr first american savings and loan of oak brook il was seized by the federal authorities for the federal government in 1986 first american savings and loan of oak brook was headed by former illinois gov dan walker dan lasater a friend of bill clinton had a brokerage business united capital corp and it traded treasury bond futures for first federal savings and loan of illinois and others dan lasater ran a brokerage firm in little rock ar he was a big contributor to bill clintons gubernatorial campaigns he was a friend of bill clinton and he flew clinton around in his private jet lasater gave roger clinton bill clintons brother a job and loaned him 8 000 to pay off a drug debt lasaters brokerage firm received a lucrative contract from the government of arkansas worth 750 000 to sell state bonds for a new arkansas state police communications network he also received millions of dollars in bonds for the arkansas development financial authority in 1986 lasater was convicted on drug charges this is bill clintons good friend he served only part of his sentence and he was pardoned after serving a small part of his sentence by then gov bill clinton in 1985 dan walker the former governor of illinois discovered that first american savings and loan was losing money big time on its treasury bond future trades with dan lasater according to court records mr walker lost approximately 361 000 walker claims that lasater made unauthorized trades with first federals money and walker told the chicago tribune they lasater co had general authority to trade but they were supposed to call the first american operating officer at the time they made the trade and they did not do that walker sued lasater for 3 3 million for mail wire and securities fraud the suit charged that one of lasaters employees used first federals money to carry out what were in effect personal treasury bill trades does this sound familiar members heard me on the floor not long ago talking about a gentleman named dennis patrick from kentucky he had a similar story according to mr patrick in published accounts between 60 million and 107 million was traded in an account in his name at lasater co without mr patricks knowledge they traded 60 million to 107 million in bond trades in his account and he did not even know about it on 1 day 23 million was traded on his account without his knowledge now when federal regulators the fslic the federal savings and loan insurance corporation seized first american of illinois they continued to pursue the lawsuit against lasater they wanted to recover as much money as they possibly could dan walker the former governor of illinois was accused of lending himself 1 4 million in federally insured depositors money and later ended up being convicted of bank fraud and perjury hopkins sutter i know this is very complicated but hopkins sutter a chicago law firm was the primary contractor or law firm for the federal savings and loan insurance corporation hopkins sutter hired or subcontracted with a law firm in little rock ar called the rose law firm to handle the suit against lasater i hope everybody will think about this my colleagues lasater co mr lasater was a very close friend of bill clinton he flew around in his private jet they went on parties together lasater was convicted along with bill clintons brother of drug dealing lasater paid one of bill clintons brothers drug loans of 8 000 and after lasater was convicted he was pardoned by then gov bill cliiton rose law firm is hired as a subcontractor for the purpose of the suit against lasater they are going to go after lasater and hillary rodham clinton and vince foster were the two lawyers from the law firm the rose law firm to go after mr lasater think about that for a minute they are going after lasater for the federal government at the same time that he is a very good friend of gov bill clinton and has been pardoned for drug trafficking by the governor dan lasater was convicted of drug charges in 1986 as i said and served only a small part of his sentence and was later pardoned by the governor now president clinton now enter hillary rodham clinton rose law firms powerhouse lawyer and vince foster they handled the governments suit against lasater it is hard to believe this conflict of interest could occur but they are handling the case against lasater bill clintons friend because of the close ties between lasater and bill and hillary clinton she never should have been involved in this matter in any way that is a big conflict of interest in late 1987 a confidential settlement was reached between the government and lasater he ended up paying 200 000 of the 3 3 million suit that is all just 200 000 the chicago tribune learned of the amount of the settlement from a february 1989 letter that foster wrote to the fdic the letter was not part of the court filings court records show that hillary rodham clinton and vince foster negotiated this settlement from 3 3 million down to 200 000 it started on may 8 1987 when hillary rodham clinton signed an amended complaint on this case that reduced the damages sought by the fslic against lasater from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million she negotiated the reduction of this down from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million for the fdic at a time when the guy lasater she was supposed to be nailing to the wall was a good friend of she and bill clinton the governor of arkansas the fdic said hillarys involvement tvas not extensive enough to constitute a conflict of interest this sounds like a whitewash by the fdic and to cover their tails the fdic said under federal rules existing at the time she did not have to inform the federal government about her close relationship with lasater and lasaters company the fdic said hillary worked only 3 houi s on the case they said she was not involved in the final decision to settle at 200 000 the fdic says vince foster did most of the work on this case he was her partner at rose the fslic that hired hillary and vince foster and the rose law firm could not remember details of the case the fdics earlier inquiry was primarily a review of court records and records submitted by the rose law firm the fdic did not interview i lary rodham clinton because of the apparent fdic wh wash in late february sena alfonse damato of new york questd the fdic acting chairm andrew hove to have the fdic insy tor general conduct a thorough rev of this matter and madison guarar hove asked the inspector general complete its investigation and relp to him in 90 days that was back february here we are in septem and the report has not yet come do now why why has the igs report come down it was demanded or quested by senator damato of senate banking committee and it supposed to be done in 90 days here we are almost a year later c months later and we have not hear thing i wonder if the white house anything to do with stopping that port obviously 90 days are over we still have no report on this case thomas scorza a former assist unitedstates attorney who teaches legal etl at the university of chicago i school said the following to the c cago tribune newspaper a lawyer is required to represent the in ests of their client zealously there is a i istantial question about whether an attor was representing a client zealously if the ponent of the client is someone with w the attorney has a political financial personal relationship and make no mistake about it i lary rodham clinton and bill clin had a very close relationship lasater and this was not made kn when hillary rodham clinton took that case in looking at the settlem he went on were they the rose law firm and hil rodham clinton looking after lasaters terests or the interests of the federal posit insurance corporation actually the federal savings loan insurance corporation scc told the chicago tribune that hill rodham clinton should not h worked on the case especially si the final settlement was confidentia william wernz a former chairmai the minnesota lawyers responsibi board for the minneapolis tribune s that the bar association model r define as conflict of interest instan where it is likely a lawyer might pull a punch because he or she some relationship with the other side some third party of interest law and accounting firms are usu barred from representing the federal c eminent in s l cases if they have per ally represented the s l or if they have sonal links to the persons targeted by lawsuit and that was specifically the case 4 lasater and company dan lasater a friend of bill clintons he conti uted generously to bill clintons c4 paign for governor he flew clin around in his private jet they had i ties together they went out toget all of the time dan lasater gave roger clinton a and loaned him a large sum of moi 1l to pay drug debts and after lasater was convicted on drug charges and ite served a small part of his sentence tor then gov bill clinton pardoned him re yet his wife hillary rodham clinan ton who knew lasater very well took ec the side of the government in the case iew against lasater reduced the settleity ment from 3 3 million down to 200 000 to and the fslic was literally screwed ort out of all of that money from 3 3 milin lion down to 200 000 there was defiber nitely a conflict of interest that she wn did not let the american people know not or the fslic know about re here is a related problem home fedthe eral savings and loan of centralia il was was also seized by federal regulators and home federals former president king ir 8 betz sued lasater and company for d a 4 6 million for unauthorized trading has he chose the rose law firm to handle re his suit and hillary rodham clinton and was a big partner in that law firm and he chose the rose law firm to handle ant his suit because the issues involved iics were similar to the issues in first aw american hi after the federal government took over home federal the federal govter ernment continued the case and they 3ub had the rose law firm carrying the ney case for them op thomas mars represented lasater on om the other side of the table against the and home federal federal government suit so you had on one side of the table hil the rose law firm of which hillary ton rodham clinton was a partner like the ith case i just cited and on the other side wn was this guy named thomas mars on now where did he come from he had ent previously worked at the rose law firm so you have on one side of the lary table negotiating for the federal govin ernment the rose law firm and you de have a former lawyer in that same law firm representing lasater does that and sound like some conniving some pecur liar circumstances mars had preary viously worked at the rose law firm ave where he had worked on the american nce suit he worked on the first american 1 suit that i just talked about therei of fore he may have had some inside inlity formation on the governments case said since the case he worked on at the iles rose law firm was very similar ces king betz the man who started the case ip the first place for home federal has savings and loan was advised by or vince foster of the rose law firm to ally accept a 250 000 outofcourt settlekov ment in september of 1989 and he 3on agreed to the settlement but he did per not know that both sides of the table the were being worked by the rose law firm and a former lawyer who worked ith for the rose law firm wras king betz says that vince foster was rib handling his suit and never told him am about mars potential conflict of interton est or the clintons ties to lasater ar according to the chicago tribune her when betz was told that mars previously worked with foster and hillary job rodham in the first federal case for hey the rose law firm betz said he cant do that he could have confidential information but the cat was already out of the bag or in the bag because he had already signed off on the 250 000 settlement on a suit that was supposed to be for 4 6 million there are some questions that need to be answered by the rose law firm and by the fslic and the fdic concerning these two cases first when will the fdic inspector general issue its report on hillary rodham clinton first american and madison guaranty is this report being delayed until after the election it was ordered in february was supposed to be done in 90 days and here we are in september 7 weeks before the election and we still do not have the report why that needs to be done quickly r0 1800 now here are some questions that need to be answered by the fdic and the new independent counsel mr starr if he is investigating this and i think he probably will and in full and complete congressional investigations and hearings did hillary rodham clinton and or the rose law firm inform the federal government of her and her husbands ties to dan lasater i do not believe she did but we need to know if she did this is regarding the first american if they did not inform the government of their ties to dan lasater then why did they not because it was obviously conflict of interest to what extent was hillary rodham clinton involved in the suits they said it was only 2 or 3 hours but she signed or got the agreement to reduce the suit from 3 3 million down to 1 3 million so she was very conversant with it and very actively involved in it specifically what role did hillary rodham clinton have in the final decision tosettle the suit for 200 000 down from the 3 3 million if she was involved how were her actions affected by her ties to dan lasater and lasater co who was responsible for handling the case hillary rodham clinton vince foster or both obviously they were both partners in the rose law firm there had to be a conflict there who decided who would handle this case if vince foster was handling the case why was hillary rodham clinton involved at all we do know for sure the fdic has said that hillary rodham clinton signed the amended complaint reducing the damages sought from 3 3 million to 1 3 million now involving the home federal case why was not king betz the chairman there told about thomas mars conflict of interest he was a former lawyer with the rose law firm defending lasater why was not betz told about the ties between the clintons and lasater was the fdic informed about any of this did thomas mars the former errfployee of the rose law firm use inside information to arseptember20 1994 co range a 250 000 settlement on an over 4 million original suit these are questions that need to be answered the more we get into the machinations of the clintons the more we find all kinds of chicanery from whitewater to madison savings loan to these two savings and loan institutions in illinois to the angel fire development in new mexico there are so many questions that need to be answered that is why we need full and complete congressional hearings not just the facade we saw with the committee on banking finance and urban affairs in the house just a few months ago the people of this country have a right to know if there is corruption in this government they have a right to know if hillary rodham clinton had a conflict of interest when she was representing these individuals for the fdic i mean her husband was the governor he was a friend of the man that she was supposed to be nailing to the wall and she reduced the claim from 3 3 million down to 200 000 there are all kinds of questions that need to be answered and the only way the people of this country are going to know the facts is for us to have complete and thorough congressional hearings and they need to be held as quickly as possible i commend to my colleagues the following february 3 1994 chicago tribune article the special prosecutor appointed to scrutinize the business dealings of the president and first lady will focus on their role in an ozark land development called whitewater but there is another case buried deep in court records that could prove equally troubling to bill and hillary rodham clinton particularly if robert fiske the republican special prosecutor and former unitedstates attorney in new york makes good on his pledge to publish a report on the clintons political and business relationships when the president was governor of arkansas in the 1980s it involves a court case the first lady helped settie when she was a highpowered lawyer in little rock and the government was trying to sort out the problems of a bankrupt illinois savings and loan the illinois s l case suggests that hillary clinton as a private attorney had a glaring conflict of interest as an attorney for the federal deposit insurance corp she helped negotiate a secret outofcourt settlement that ended the governments suit against a family friend and an influential benefactor of her husband but the political problems the case could pose for the president and his wife may go far beyond the narrow questions about the first ladys conduct as a lawyer which she defends as in whitewater the illinois case places the president and his wife once again in an association with an unsavory wheelerdealer who had strong personal ties to the clintons and even stronger financial ties to the clinton administration in little rock in whitewater the trouble stems from the clintons business relationship with james mcdougal the guiding force behind madison guaranty an arkansas savings and loan that went broke and cost taxpayers more than 47 million fiske will examine whether clinton or his gubernatorial campaign benefited from mcdougals favorable treatment by a state agency in arkansas when clinton was governor in the illinois case the problem stems from the clintons friendship with dan lasater a convicted felon whose highflying bond tradingfirm played a hand in the troubles of several savings and loans including first american savings and loan association an oak brook institution headed by another politician dan walker who was governor of illinois from 1973 to 1977 it all started in 1979 in an unlikely venuethe oaklawn park racetrack in hot springs ark clintons mother the late virginia kelley had a passion for thoroughbred horseracing and her box at the track was next to lasaters an arkansas native who grew up in poverty in kokomo ind lasater started a hamburger chain when he was 19 and was wealthy by the time he met mrs kelley and clintons halfbrother roger at the racetrack in just over twb decades lasater had sold his first hamburger chain moved to arkansas founded the ponderosa steakhouse a nationwide chain of 650 family restaurants started a bond trading firm and nurtured his love for horseracing the racetrack friendship soon blossomed into an introduction to clinton who was trying to regain the governors mansion after losing an election in 1980 according to a clinton family friend by early 1983 lasater had given roger clinton a job at his florida horse farm clinton had reclaimed the governors mansion and lasaters bond firm had been added to a list of brokerage firms eligible to underwrite state bond issues a classification that generated millions of dollars in business for his firm according to published reports over the next two years the ties between lasater and the clintons grew stronger the clintons benefited from the relationship lasater contributed money to the governors campaign lent roger clinton 8 000 to pay off a drug debt sponsored fundraising parties at his offices made his private plane available to the ambitious young governor for campaign jaunts and encouraged his staff to donate to the governors campaign promising higher commissions to compensate for the donations according to published reports at one point in 1985 he also made his plane available to squire celebrities to a charity function organized by hillary rodham clinton lasater benefited from the closer ties too in the summer of 1985 clinton successfully lobbied the arkansas legislature to approve a contract for lasater to sell 30 2 million in bonds for the new state police radio system the contract netted lasaters firm 750 000 according to a report in the los angeles times meanwhile lasater spread his financial wings beyond arkansas signing deals to trade treasury bond futures with several savings and loans including walkers first american the s ls were trying to compensate for their moneylosing mortgage lending operations by engaging in the highrisk deals being peddled by lasater but things began to sour in late 1985 both in illinois and in arkansas at first american walker discovered that lasaters bond firm didnt have the magic touch according to court records walkers s l lost at least 361 572 in tbond futures trades made by lasaters firm they had general authority to trade but they were supposed to call the first american operating officer each time they made a trade walker said in a telephone interview they did not do that meanwhile law enforcement officers in arkansas had started picking up reports that lasater had another problem he was distrib h9297 uting cocaine to friends and business associ ates at swank parties he threw in little rock and hot springs walker struck first filing a 1985 suit against lasaters bond firm alleging that the company committed mail wire and securities fraud by using first american funds for unauthorized tbond futures trades walker never got lasater in court first american was seized in 1986 by federal officials who later charged the former illinois governor with lending himself 1 4 million in federally insured deposits walker was eventually convicted of bank fraud and perjury federal officials also collared lasater they convicted him of cocaine possession and trafficking in 1986 meanwhile the federal regulators who seized first american decided to pursue the savings and loans 3 3 million suit against lasater to see if they could recoup some money for american taxpayers who funded the billiondollar bailout of hundreds of bankrupt savings and loans including first american the governments deposit insurance fund hired the rose law firm in little rock where hillary clinton was a powerhouse rose had successfully solicited the governments legal work on failed savings and loans in arkansas months earlier the lasater connection caused no end of problems for gov clinton during his reelection campaign in 1986 clinton came under attack from his republican opponent for steering state contracts to lasater while lasater was under investigation for drug trafficking clinton acknowledged being friends with lasater but denied knowing about lasaters drug activities clinton was reelected in 1987 lasater went off to serve his prison sentence after giving patsy thomasson another key clinton supporter and democratic party activist legal authority to manage his assets according to court records most of the rose firms s l legal work was andied by webster hubbel now the no 3 official at the unitedstates justice department but the firm assigned the governments suit against lasater to hillary clinton and vincent foster who later became deputy white house counsel for president clinton and who committed suicide last july in late 1987 court records show hillary clinton and foster negotiated a confidential settlement lasater paid the government 200 000 in return for the dismissal of its 3 3 million suit against him whether lasater got off cheaply at the expense of the american taxpayer depends upon his assets at the time and the strength of the evidence against him legal experts say nevertheless thomas scorza a former assistant unitedstates attorney who teaches legal ethics at the university of chicago law school said hillary clintons decision to represent the government in a lawsuit against lasater raises serious questions about her professional conduct a lawyer is required to represent the interest of their client zealously he said there is a substantial question about whether an attorney was representing a client zealously if the opponent of the client is someone with whom the attorney had a political financial and personal r~lationship in looking at the settlement were they the rose law firm looking after lasaters interests or the interests of the fdic scorza asked hillary clintons office declined to respond to specific questions about the case but issued a general statement defending her legal ethics our view is that hillary clinton when a lawyer at the rose law firm acted with the utmost integrity and professionallsm i have no reason to believe otherwise said her press secretary lisa caputo to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest scorza said hillary clinton should not have worked on the walker s l caseespecially because the final settlement was confidential the tribune learned of the amount of the settlement from a february 1989 letter that foster wrote to the fdic the letter was not part of the court filing theres no evidence in the court case that the rose law firm or hillary clinton ever disclosed to their client the fdic the ties between tie clintons and lasater or thomasson who was representing lasaters interests at the time of the settlement thomasson who later became executive secretary of the arkansas democratic party is now director of the white house office of administration david barr an fdic spokesman said fdic attorneys are trying to locate records on first american to see if the rose law firm notified the fdic about any potential conflict of interest a law firm can be banned from receiving further work from the fdic and the resolution trust corp which disposes the assets of failed s ls if it misleads fdic officials about a possible conflict of interest barr said the first american case isnt the only problem for the firm which hillary clinton left before her husband assumed the presidency the fdic is trying to determine whether the rose firm misled federal regulators about a potential conflict of interest when the firm represented the deposit insurance fund against the accountants who worked for madison guaranty hillary clinton had represented madison the savings and loan at the heart of whitewater in addition fdic officials are looking into the case of home federal savings and loan of centralia another failed illinois institution which is very similar to the first american case it is not known whether hillary clinton was directly involved in the home federal case the rose law firm represented home federal in a 4 6 million suit against lasaters company for unauthorized trading but what is unusual about this case is that lasater too was represented by an attorney with ties to rose king betz former president of home federal said he initially hired the rose law firm because the claims in his suit were nearly identical to those in the first american case he said that vince foster was the lead attorney in the case and that he had no contact with hillary clinton after the government took over home federal it continued the case meanwhile though thomas mars a rose attorney who had worked with foster and hillary clinton in the first american suit against lasater left the rose firm months later he started representing lasater against home federal which was still represented by rose legal experts say the rose law firm should have notified betz and the fdic ab6ut mars potential conflict of interest because mars worked on the first american suit he could have had inside information that gave him an advantage in negotiating a settlement for lasater in the home federal suit betz says foster never told him about lasaters ties to the clintons he also failed to advise betz about mars potential conflict of interest betz said foster advised him to accept a 250 000 outofcourt settlement in we were told by the attorneys that we were not going to get any more money said betz who agreed to the settlement when told that mars had previously worked with foster and hillary clinton in the first federal case betz said he cant do that he could have confidential information mars denied any wrongdoing tnere was nothing funny going on everything was always on the up and up everything was done in a businesslikemanner he said"],

for the clinton health care bill in its legislative form in the other body where it is the clintonmitchell bill and in the house where it is the clintongephardt bill the same phenomenon occurred last year during consideration of the clinton tax bill during the 1992 campaign as a candidate he talked about middleclass tax cut but in fact we know how quickly that evaporated once we got down to brass tacks instead this congress pushed through the biggest tax increase in american history one that directly impacted the middle class for example seniors receiving social security making 14 000 got a 70percent effective rate increase on their social security benefits that is how much their income taxes went up on social security benefits that recordbreaking tax increase passed by the congress will pale in comparison to the clintongephardt bill that we are likely to take on here in the house although it is difficult for us to talk about it as members of congress because while we have looked at the press releases and press statements about the bill we are still waiting we are still waiting for a bill even though we are just days away from adjournment and the congress hopes to act on health care before we adjourn but we do not have a bill the congressional budget office has not been able to give us an estimate of how much precisely in the way of new taxes the bill contains and precisely how much in the way of new spending the bill contains we simply have not read it this is more than a trivial point health care comprises oneseventh of our nations economy it is also on a more personal level a matter of life and death for every american one would think that a new health care plan prescribed by the federal government for the whole country would therefore be the most carefully studied document since the constitution but instead when as and if this congress and house get around to seeing and voting on a bill we are going to find that members have not had a chance to read it that in fact when we vote members will know more about o j simpsons blood type than they will about the content of our own health care legislation but we operate necessarily in an environment of uncertainty we do not have a bill but we must debate what it is we anticipate because after all the vote will be upon us and that will be it and we will have an election we must adjourn at some point and that point is arriving rather quickly why are people skeptical of what they have been seeing the heritage foundation did an analysis of the clintongephardt bill as it was released what they found is that the ew taxes and there are many of them in the clintongephardt bill would amount to 42 6 billion in the first full effective year of the plan in 1999 on top of the current costs on the system people who are saying these new taxes are only going to displace existing health care costs or somehow limit the growth of health care costs must face this fact 42 6 billion in new taxes will be imposed by the clintongephardt health care bill on top of our current estimates for how much the existing system is going to cost now the average additional tax burden per individual as a result of the clintongephardt bill according to the heritage foundation is 430 per individual on average the clintongephardt bill unquestionably is going to offer americans less choice it does not quite do justice to the fact to say less almost none compared to what presently an insured american has available congress and the federal government are going to prescribe a standard health care plan and that is going to be the norm for the country like it or not if your existing plan is different than the standard plan if you continue to get those benefits you will pay a tax not only will you pay a tax but your employer will pay a tax the new taxes imposed by the clintongephardt bill are going to be split 80 percent by the employer and 20 percent by the individual so 20 percent of these new taxes will come directly out of the paycheck of the american worker there will be far more bureaucracy in this plan because for a substantial part it is going to rely upon something called medicare part c medicare part c is in effect a governmentrun insurance plan that will extend together with the existing medicare program to over half the entire population or to about half the entire population according to our best estimates half of the american people at that point will be getting their health care from a government plan as compared to the current system the more americans learn it seems the more likely they are to realize that instead of providing americans with greater health security the clinton gephardt plan clinton mitchell plan over in the other body and whatever congressional cousins are aboard or are just now being written in so many different staff offices will create greater uncertainty especially for middleincome americans middleincome americans will pay more in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both taxes and health care premiums for less in both quantity availability of health care and the quality of that care why will they be paying more in premiums we discussed why they pay more in taxes under the clinton gephardt bill why pay more in premiums because of the community rating system that is where factors like age cannot be taken into account senior citizens incur about 4 timeson average in the way of health care costs as younger working americans if you are under 45 years old you will have a steep increase in your health care premiums under a community rating system so for all americans under 45 years old the clinton gephardt plan the clinton gephardt health care plan is going to represent a big increase in premiums on top of the payroll tax increase it is not surprising then that the strategy of the democrat leadership is to in the words of senator rockfeller pass health care regardless of the views of the american people i would hope we would not handle it that way i do hope instead of a legislative version of blindmans bluff we will get at least 30 days to read any health care bill that will come forth for a

happened is the democrat majority has said the only way we are going to have hearings in either the house or the senate is if it is very structured and very limited they want to limit it to three things the death of vincent foster the removal by the white house personnel immediately after his death of files from his office and white house attempts to influence the resolution trust corporation investigation of mr and mrs clintons role in the arkansas s l but the investigation by the house and the senate should be much much broader i wantto tell my colleagues whr first of all there are questions about mr fiske the special prosecutors objectivity mr fiske was a very close associate at various times when theywere both in new york practicing law with bernie nussbaum one of the chief advisers to president clinton as a matter of fact mr fiske the special prosecutor special investigator in this case tried to get mr nussbaum appointed assistant counsel during the irancontra investigation mr fiskes law firm represented the international paper co which got a 10 million loan from the arkansas development finance authority in arkansas his firm also represented the international paper co during the time when they sold hundreds of acres to the whitewater development corp mr fiske recommended louis freeh now head of the fbi to be the head of the fbi to mr nussbaum at the white house so there is some question about whether there will be complete thoroughness on the part of mr fiske and his staff in investigating the white house allegations but beyond that there is a lot of other things that need to be investigated because more and more is coming out daily first of all why did thengovernor bill clinton pardon a convicted cocaine dealer dan lasater in 1990 dan lasater pleaded guilty to federal drug charges in december 1988 but he served only 6 months of a 2 2year sentence while he was reportedly under investigation by the arkansas state police for drug dealing president clinton and the government of arkansas gave him 664 million in bonds to sell for the state which garnered him 1 6 million in commissions why did thengovernor bill clinton pardon copvcted cocaine dealer dan lasater in 1990 after all this involvement with him and they gave big contributions to clintons campaign he is thenpardoned for cocaine trafficking was it because dan lasater was a large contributor was it because dan lasater had flown the governor around arkansas and the country in his private jet was it because dan lasater gave roger clinton president clintons brother a job at his florida horse stables and loaned him 8 000 to pay back a drug debt did bill clinton know about the lasater investigation and lasaters drug use at the time he gave him 664 million in state bonds to sell according to published accounts and mr dennis patrick between wo million and 107 million was traded in an account in his name at lasater co without his knowledge that may have involved laundering of drug money one day 23 million was traded in his account patsy thomasson the chief personnel officer at the white house was running lasater co she was chief financial officer at the time now she is special assistant to the president of the united states where did this money come from where did it go did ms thomasson know about these transactions i do not know how she could not have there are of course other things that need to be explained in 1985 the arkansas development finance authority was created by bill clinton to provide economic development loans to small businesses in arkansas a number of serious questions have been raised about adfa which need to be investigated listen to this on december 29 1988 adfa deposited 50 million in a bank in the cayman islands why are you taking money out of the state of ar kansas and putting it in the cayman islands this money was transferred through simmons first national bank of pine bluff ar why did adfa deposit 50 million in an offshore bank instead of a bank in some other part of the country or in arkansas the interest rates were approximately the same the state departments international narcotics control report described the cayman islands as a haven for the laundering of drug money and here is the arkansas development finance authority sending 50 million down there was the 50 million plus interest repaid to adfa right now we do not have any documentation as to whether it was ever repaid we do not know what happened to it did the arkansas development fixiance authority make any other offshore deposits and for what reasons public documents show that adfa was steering millions of dollars in bond underwriting business to lasater and his company who i said before was convicted for drug dealing why would adfa give all of this business to lasater co while dan lasater the companys president was under federal investigation for narcotics trafficking i the american people need to knowthe answers to these questions and we are very very concerned that mr fiske may limit the investigation so that we never get the answers if somebody at the white house was involved in the laundering of drug money then we should have a full accounting it should be explained to this body and to the american people and if there is no reason to believe that then why does not the white house patsy thomasson and

why under the clintons governmentrun approach price controls global budgets and heavy penalties for people seeking to secure extra health care will mean that health services americans have immediate access to today will not be available to them in the clintondefined health care system of tomorrow the evidence in support of this prediction is incontrovertible in the governmentrun health care

lay out a little history give a iittle geographical background on north korea a little history about north korea ta3k about the military of north korea as compared to the mil tary of south korea and the united states forces and the commitments that we have over on the korean peninsula let me begien by talking a little of north korea first of all let us look at north korea from a geographic point of view north korea is a country that is about probably less than half the size of the state of nevada it has a popo latlon of approximately 22 mflion people north korea is a very closed seeety in north korea for example if you buy a radio or are supplied a radto in north korea in the united states we are all able to tune across the spectrum to bring in a radio station of our choice in north korea you only have one station and it is the government station the north korean society and the country of north korea is under a di tatorship that dictatorship is under mr kim iisong mr kim flsong has been the dictator the longest he is the longest ruling dictator in the world in fact i believe if my information i correct he is the longest ruler in the world now that is still alive so under this dictatorship the senior and i am going to refer to him as the father has a son who we will call junior the son who is about 55 years old the son has been trained to succeed or has been brought up to succeed his father but let us go back to the continent i hope in the fture when we have an opportunity to once again address you here on the floor that i can have a map and we will have a little better wellprepared map i think that will give you a little more perspective of where north korea is in regard to south korea and what those dangers are as you can recall the korean war in 1950 the north koreans under the pretext of military exercises launched an attack against south korea now the same dictator that was the dictator back then is still the dictator today north korea is a very very aggressive nation it is not only a very closed society but it is also a very aggressive nation one of the difficulties we have in assessing what is going on in north korea is the limitation on our intelligence gatheringr capabilities because of the closedness of a society back to the geographics on the geographies of north korea the dmz which is the socalled neutraj zone designated by the united states to bring the korean war to a conclusion the dmz is actually less than 35 miles from the capital of south korea seoul south korea is the name of that capital now in seoul south korea to give you an idea that has a population of about ig million people and it is onehalf of the gross national product of south korea is located in that large city of seoul south korea what concerns us of course about north korea is not only its aggressive nature but also its renegade status as we speak today in regards to its compliance with the nonproliferation agreement many of you have read in the media lately that north korea has refused compliance with inspections in fact the last inspection that north korea allowed was several months ago and when the nspectors went to north korea to inspect one of the nuclear facilittee they were only allowed to idspect it late at night they were given flashljghta and led through several dark buildings with very dim flashlights and allowed a very limited access to the socalled inapectios this has led to a very high tension between north and south korea we have an idea of what the geographitc are let us talk about the military ca pabilities of north korea first of all understand that north korea has about 1 2 00 troops these troops we believe are well trained they have the protection of a very aggressive and veryo intense tunnel system on the north korean side and thee 1 200 000 troops represent twice the number of troops that south korea has south korea has approximately 650 000 and the united states has about 35 000 young men and women that ass over in south korea under the agreement in 1954 that we signed in protection of south korea the north korean also has probably twice the amount of artillery that the south korean ha the north koreans have missile capability ballistic missile capability and are known to have scud missiles that is going to come back in later when i talk about the de ployment of the patriot missiles of the united states onto the south korean peninsula however back to the military in 1984 north korea began to use the dmz instead of a defensive zone they began to reconstitute their military forces in such a way that they could launch a very quick military attack on south korea in fact the defense department and other experts as i have read are led to believe that north korea could actually launch an attack and we would have less than 24 hours less than hours notice that an attack was imminent on south korea their military forces as i have said earlier are twice the number of the american forces they have twice the number of the american forces and the south korean forces combined they have twice the number of artillery we believe they have chemical capabilities we do believe they use those chemical capabilities north korea is not only a fierce and horrible fighting force horrible in the way of terror but they have also been guilty of several terrorist activities including bombing including as many remember the korean jet airliner where the north korean secret agents went and blew up the south korean passenger airliner so their entire history shows a history of aggression all of this is going to add up to my conclusion about the importance of why we have to have the patriot missile where is the north korean army short of military capability certainly with the air force north korea has a very very limited amm of air force or air capability we are far superior in the south in the united states and with our carrier that sits off the coast our capabilties to deliver air power are far superior but remember that the north koreans have a great deal of artillery and i believe they have a nuclear weapon they have these in the tunnel systems we believe they hid them in the tunnel systems our satellite intelligence cannot pick up tunnel systems i guess we can pick up trucks going and coming from the tunnels if we are there at the right time and if there are excellent weather conditions and things like that but at the current time it is very difficult to got the kind of intelligence that we need to have over there we do have superior air power what would be a logical attack or a logical strategy for north korea to follow if it were to launch an attack on south korea the most logical thing for them to do i to launch a missile attack on seoul south korea remember i mentioned that seoul which is the capital of south korea has at least half the population of the country about 10 million people it is responsible for at least onehalf the gross national product of the country what would be a more logical target to hit than seoul south korea seoul south korea is located how far from the dmz how far from the north korean troops less than 35 miles less than 35 miles remember earlier i mentioned north koreas ability their ballistic missile capability it is fairly incredible let us go back to the north korean military troops that are amassed on the dmz as i mentioned earlier since 1984 they have reconstituted their force to be a quick strike force seventy percent a full 70 percent of the north korean military forces are on the dmz they are not in a defensive posture they are in an offensive posture they are as newsweek reported newsweek of a couple months ago they are warready that brings me up to the point that i want to discuss here what are some of the responsibilities that we have in south korea first and foremost as long as we have young american men and women who are deployed over in south korea we have an obligation a very basic and fundamental obligation that was overlooked in somalia but a basic and fundamental obligation that shall not be overlooked in south korea that is to properly arm those personnel with defensive weapons not offensive weapons but defensive weapons in the last few months to lay out just a little more background in the last few months as members have read in their papers and in any of the periodicals or we have listened to the president discuss in the speeches there has been a big issue as to what north korea is doing whether or not they have nuclear capability or how far along they are to obtaining nuclear capability there is some disagreement in the intelligence community but i can tell the members personally i believe north korea possesses at least one nuclear weapon do they have the capabilities to deliver that particular weapon the answer i think is yes it is a sophisticated weapon i think the answer is no however there is a reason that north korea is refusing to allow the international inspectors to come in and look at those nuclear facilities is it because they have something to hide of course it is of course it is we have to add all of these things up first they will not let us inspect their nuclear facilities second they have 70 percent of their military troops on the dmz in an offensive state third they have twice the size twice the number of troops that the united states and south korea have combined fourth they have the artillery and the missile capability the scud missile capability to deliver i think a very devastating attack within hours in fact recently newsweek and then later reuters news service revealed that defense department documents showed that if north korea launched an attack against south korea that within two weeks they could be well beyond seoul south korea in other words in control of south korea what would the united states do first of all we know that if north korea launches an attack against south korea the american young men and women over there along with the south korean soldiers will suffer very immediate very tragic and horrible casualties this will happen immediately we need to properly defend those kinds of troops now is there sufficient incentive for the current regime to launch an attack on south korea i think there is first of all remember recent history remember kuwait remember iraq in the iraqi war it showed the third world that a regime could go to war with the united states of america and the current ruling regime could survive the war they can survive the war that sends a message that you can take on the united states and survive it second there is a reason they have that number of troops on the dmz third we are about to go through a transition period remember i talked earlier about the father and the son the son kim jongi1 is about 55 years old he does not carry the same kind of respect or credibility that his father does i think recently they have seen a lot more activity from the son the son may feel that he has to prove something of a macho capability the next thing is we know north korea has a horrible horrible economy the dictatorship the father kim flsung and the son kim jongil are going to have to divert the people of north korea from their economy with some other diversion i think if their regime is to survive with this transition taking place where power transfers from the father down to the son there has to be a diversion the father has constantly committed throughout his years as a dictator that it is his goal to see that the korean peninsula is reunited everything spells incentive for the north koreans to take some kind of action against the south koreans back to what it is that the united states should do should we for example launch a preemptive attack like israel did years ago on a nuclear facility i do not think that the logistics allow that i do not think we would have support from the american people to do something like that i do not think that that is a very logical approach to take there are other things that we can do the first thing that the united states needs to do and that the administration needs to do is that the administration needs to stand tough stick with its previous comments made about 2 monthi ago or excuse me about 2 weeks ago that they intend to deploy patriot missiles on south korean soil what is the importance of patriot missiles what are patriot missiles remember the iraq war and the great success we had in stopping the scud missiles remember earlier i mentioned that north korea had scud missiles the missile that was able to stop those fierce attacks against israel was the patriot missile it has since been advanced from a technological point of view and is even more effective we need to immediately have the administration which i think right now unfortunately is beginning to waiver on their commitment i think that the administration needs to immediately deploy defensive intercept patriot missiles to protect our troops in southkorea"], [0.001668739365413785, 0.001668739365413785, 0, "i thank my friend the gentleman from sanibel fl for yielding me this time and i would like to

important process the 3day layover why is it that we have the 3day layover very simply i do not think you would enter into a business agreement or purchase a home or engage in any kind of major activity without having read it first the idea behind the 3day layover is very simple it is there so that we may in fact allow members to have the opportunity to review legislation before they exercise their constitutional right and vote for it or against it as we look at this problem of the 3day layover we have once again waived the rule here we are on march 10 1993 the 3d month of the loedcongress and what has happened well five of the past six pieces of legislation that we have had rules on that have been considered here on the house floor have waived the 3day layover back in 1983 and 1984 5 percent of the rules that came down waived the 3day layover but so far in the 103d congress 83 percent of the rules considered here have waived the 3day layover on 83 percent of the major legislation we are considering we do not allow members to read it based on the rules of this house now let us look at the last 20 years the perpage average of statutes that have come forward in 1972 was 3 8 pages in 1992 it was 12 8 pages so we have seen an increase in the size of legislation but we have had a decrease in the ability for members to at least look at legislation it seems to me that we once again are continuing this 100percent record of restrictive rules limiting the ability of members to exercise their right to represent the 600 000 constituents who sent them here and i think we

find jobs let alone good ones and of hardworking americans who see their jobs evaporating next week or next year these people rightfully see themselves falling ever more rapidly from the middle class

at good pay and a rightful place in a growing and economically secure middle class no i dont agree with every detail of this budget for example i strongly oppose the 500 tax credit per child for those with 200 000 per year incomes if a deduction is included at all there should be an income cap to target the deductions for middleincome families but this can be taken up in the tax bill and appropriately targeted i also do not agree that cuts and adjusted means testing of higher income seniors and medicare should be defined today this needs much more work and a much more thorough
