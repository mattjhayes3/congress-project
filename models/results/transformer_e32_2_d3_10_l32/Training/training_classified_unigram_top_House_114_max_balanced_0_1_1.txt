revenue service in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors article 1 john andrew koskinen in his conduct while commissioner of the internal revenue service engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with his duties as an officer of the united states as follows commissioner koskinen failed in his duty to respond to lawfully issued congressional subpoenas on august 2 2013 the committee on oversight and government reform of the house of representatives issued a subpoena to the secretary of the treasury jacob lew the custodian of the internal revenue service documents that subpoena demanded among other things all communications sent or received by lois lerner from january 1 2009 to on february 14 2014 following the senates confirmation of john andrew koskinen as commissioner of the internal revenue service the committee on oversight and government reform of the house of representatives reissued the subpoena to him on march 4 2014 internal revenue service employees in martinsburg west virginia magnetically erased 422 backup tapes destroying as many as 24 000 of lois lerners emails responsive to the subpoena this action impeded congressional investigations into the internal revenue service targeting of americans based on their political affiliation the american people may never know the true culpability or extent of the internal revenue service targeting because of the destruction of evidence that took place wherefore john andrew koskinen by such conduct warrants impeachment and trial and removal from office article 2 john andrew koskinen engaged in a pattern of deception that demonstrates his unfitness to serve as commissioner of the internal revenue service commissioner koskinen made a series of false and misleading statements to congress in contravention of his oath to tell the truth those false statements included the following number 1 on june 20 2014 commissioner koskinen testified that since the start of this investigation every email has been preserved nothing has been lost nothing has been destroyed number 2 on june 23 2014 commissioner koskinen testified that the internal revenue service had confirmed that backup tapes from 2011 no longer existed because they have been recycled pursuant to the internal revenue services normal policy he went on to explain that confirmed means that somebody went back and looked and made sure that in fact any backup tapes that had existed had been recycled number 3 on march 26 2014 commissioner koskinen was asked during a hearing before the

early as february 2014 and no later than april 2014 he was aware that a substantial portion of lois lerners emails could not be produced to congress however in a march 19 2014 letter to senator wyden of the senate committee on finance commissioner koskinen said we are transmitting today additional information that we believe completes our production to your committee and the house ways and means

revenue service had gone to great lengths to retrieve all of lois lerners emails commissioner koskinens actions contradicted the assurances he gave to congress the treasury inspector general for tax administration found over 1 000 of lois lerners emails that the internal revenue service had failed to produce those discoveries took only 15 days of investigation to uncover the treasury inspector general for tax administration searched a number of available sources including disaster backup tapes lois lerners blackberry the email server backup tapes for the email server and lois lerners

proud of our colleagues and we support each other in times of need i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries the gentleman from new york who is also host of this special order i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home

and a blank check with doddfrank democrats deemed it necessary to punish small community banks with burdensome regulations they cannot afford to comply with doddfrank created a new unaccountable bureaucracy called the cfpb which is funded in a way that obscures its transparency and prevents congress direct oversight of the agency the lack of accountability like that seen with the cfpb and the heavy hand of agencies like the epa and the irs have become hallmarks of this administration with the stimulus bill democrats gave handouts to their union and socalled green energy friends taxpayers were on the hook for loan guarantees to companies like solyndra which used its political connections in the white house to push through irresponsible loan approvals when solyndra went bankrupt it was at the cost of the american people many other smaller boondoggles came out of the stimulus silly studies on ducks over 1 million on road signs that promote the stimulus and over 3 million for a tunnel for turtles in florida this leaves obamacare too many americans have felt the negative consequences of what boils down to a government takeover of the healthcare industry the president claimed this law would decrease premiums by 2 500 per year instead they have risen since obamacare has been enacted to go with the increase in cost many americans have seen a sharp decrease in their choices there are fewer plans available restricting the ability of hardworking families to choose coverage that is appropriate for their circumstances taken together this trio of liberal policies is adding layers of bureaucratic red tape forcing americans to pay more for health care and putting taxpayers on the hook in 2009 democrats used the blank check to add 1 5 trillion in discretionary spending when republicans gained control of the house of representatives in 2011 we put discretionary spending on a downward trend discretionary spending funds our federal agencies such as the epa and the irs as well as the department of defense we have made real cuts in spending not slowdowns in growth and not projected cuts down the roadhonesttogod cuts in spending since i took office in 2011 discretionary spending has been cut significantly by 434 billion but this does not address mandatory spending which is the real driver of our national debt this includes programs like food assistance welfare medicare medicaid social security and interest on our debt reforms are needed to ensure these programs work efficiently and are sustainable because of the way obamacare was written and enacted mandatory spending also includes large portions of obamacare funding mandatory spending is on autopilot and will continue with or without congress annual appropriations process the fact is we have to change the law that means both chambers of congress have to pass reforms and the president has to sign them or we have to override a veto mandatory spending accounts for threequarters of all money spent by the federal government this is a 180degree change from when i was a teenager when in 1970 mandatory spending was only about a third of government spending realistically there is only one path to a balanced budget and shrinking our national debt that path is to pass a budget and use a process called reconciliation a budget facilitates reconciliation which only requires a 51vote majority in the united states senate and avoids a filibuster by liberals who want to continue running up americas credit card not doing a budget forfeits the opportunity to do reconciliation reconciliation with mandatory spending program reforms coupled with real tax and regulatory reforms will send a strong signal to our entrepreneurs and businesses which will unleash innovation and the american spirit and will thus grow our economy and provide for our national defense a vibrant economy will provide for our national security and priorities without raising taxes we have an opportunity with a new

forward to tonights special order hour congressman jeffries and i along with our colleagues from the congressional black caucus will have scholarly debate on how our democracy is in crises because of the assault on the right to vote in america as we just heard from mr jeffries and we will hear from others voting is the voice of the people the voting rights act of 1965 passed with bipartisan support established strong federal protections for the freedom to vote banning or limiting many of the discriminatory election policies and practices of the jim crow south combined with subsequent legislation such as the national voter registration act which requires state agencies to provide opportunities for voter registration the voting rights act has helped our nation make significant progress in boosting voting for african americans and other historically marginalized groups but we find ourselves today facing our first presidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the voting rights act as mr jeffries referenced in shelby the supreme court decision reversed over 50 years of progress made to expand access to the voting booth and opened a pathway to new voting laws that discriminate against african american voters as a result of shelby new voting restrictions have been put in place in 22 states 18 of them republicanled since 2010 making it harder for millions of americans to exercise their right to vote the way states have been able to reduce the voting power of minority communities and put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to make it harder for millions of americans to vote is appalling our democracy is in crisis our right to vote is under assault why would we want to make it harder for americans to vote i believe we should be making it easier for americans to have access to the ballot box but apparently some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not agree we need to put forth a vote on the voting rights act now new laws range from strict photo id requirements to early voting cutbacks to registration restriction among these 16 states with new voting restrictions is my home state of ohio in ohio in 2014 lawmakers cut 6 days of early voting and eliminated the golden week during which voters could register and cast a ballot all in one trip of course ohio is not alone in its efforts to make it harder for americans to vote the freedom to vote is one of americas most constitutionally guaranteed rights and it should be easily accessible to those who want to exercise it that is why i am honored this congress to serve as the deputy vice chair of the newly created congressional voting rights caucus a caucus dedicated to protecting our democracy by ensuring the fundamental right to vote is safeguarded for all americans however after a longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on voting protections house republicans now refuse to bring either bill to the floor for a vote this is unthinkable the voting rights act of 1965 has been reauthorized with bipartisan support five times congress has a duty to ensure elections are free and transparent so that all eligible voters feel comfortable and welcome i would echo president obamas february 13 2013 statement on the voting rights act and let me quote we must all do our part to make sure our godgiven rights are protected that includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote when any american no matter where they live or what their party are denied that right we are betraying our ideals there are 168 days until the presidential election and our democracy still has far too many missing voices particularly among those who are already at a disadvantage due to deeply rooted racial and class barriers in our society we must ensure that voter suppression is not the new normal in order to have a truly vibrant democracy the united states must take steps to ensure inclusive voting by reducing barriers to voting efforts to suppress voting turnout undermine democracy and those efforts are on the wrong side of history as i close the time is now i am calling on all people including our community and national leaders to join me in working to eliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought for marched for died for that is the voting rights act human rights

elementary school there have been over 1 100 mass shootings more than 34 000 lives have been cut short by someone using a gun the house of representatives has held 30 moments of silence for the victims of mass shootings since sandy hook and yet we havent taken a single vote on legislation that would help keep guns out of dangerous hands i think that is shameful the american people deserve more than silence the american people deserve a congress that is willing to stand up and do whatever it takes to keep our communities safe that starts by making sure that terrorists criminal domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill dont have easy access to purchase guns in our country today suspected terrorists can legally buy guns in our country individuals who are on the fbis terrorist watch list can walk into a gun store pass a background check and walk out with a gun or the guns of their choosingand they can do it legally since 2004 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists were able to purchase guns more than 90 percent of all suspected terrorists who tried to purchase guns in the last 11 years walked away with the weapon that they went in to buy now in the wake of the horrific attacks in orlando congress must make it a priority to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of suspected terrorists there is bipartisan legislation that would prohibit those on the terrorist watch list from being able to purchase firearms in our country this bill is common sense if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun it is long past time for the republican leadership to bring that bill up for a vote we also need to pass my bipartisan bill to require background checks for all commercial gun sales background checks are our first line of defense when it comes to stopping dangerous people from getting firearms we know that background checks work every day they stop more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun

flourish what does this administration produce more than 60 of every day here is a hint it is not jobs the answer lies in the heart of many woes facing small businesses and established industries what they produce every day is regulations the goal of any regulation should be to achieve a benefit that would not be possible without it designed in such a fashion that the achieved benefit far outweighs the cost but our administration has lost sight of this goal and americas economic engine is paying the price our current federal government designs regulations that are often unnecessary and achieve little to no benefit but at very high cost the rules have become so skewed that this administrations regulators are at war with american businesses industries such as manufacturing and technology are fighting to compete in a global market but first they must survive the regulatory beast that is strangling innovation and growth this administration is legislating through regulation yet decries the reins act and calls it an unprecedented requirement when you circumvent congress and exploit the rulemaking process in order to one make law and two make law in contradiction to the wishes and needs of the american people you should expect unprecedented responses in just the first 7 days of 2015just the first 7 days of 2015the administration unveiled 300 new rules over the memorial day weekend the administration quietly published the spring 2015 unified agenda of federal regulations what it contained was so disheartening to the american people and so destructive to small business that it didnt go unnoticed the agenda showed that the federal departments and agencies have 3 260 rules in the midst right now of the rulemaking process unfortunately it is not just the sheer number of regulations that is astounding it is also the oppressive cost one of these 3 260 rules i mentioned is predicted to be one of the costliest regulations ever put forward the epas national ozone standard a recent analysis found the cost of this one regulation to be upwards of 140 billion it will cost my home state of georgia over 11 000 jobs to add insult to injury the first line of h r 427 statement

manner this is the statement from the administration on why they oppose h r i cannot believe that a single regulation promulgated by this administration with 140 billion of cost was put forward in the most costeffective manner and a regulation costing 11 000 jobs in georgia alone is hardly smart the statement of administration policy also claims that the underlying legislation would create business uncertainty i encourage this administration to use the infamous pen and phone to actually ask businesses what creates uncertainty for them because when small businesses across the country came to congress last week as part of national federation of independent business lobbying day their top legislative priority was regulatory relief these are smallbusiness owners who sat with us and said here is what we are facing in trying to get people jobs the 3 000plus regulations in the works by this administration create the uncertainty not this bodys effort to require agencies to submit the most costly regulations to congress for approval the underlying bill applies only to regulations with a 100 million impact or greater the american people do not elect this administrations regulatorsor any administrations regulators for that matter they elect us in this body to represent them this bill allows us to do so properly the system is broken the system has failed the american people the reins act is the first step toward restoring proper order and even sanity toward our regulatory framework the administration states that executive order no 13563 requires careful costbenefit analysis but they dont explain why only 7 rules out of the thousands had costbenefit analysis in 2013 and only 14 rules had that in 2012 this administrations regulators have stated publicly that they are not going

country by someone using a gun 34 000 that is someones child someones brother someones loved one someones wife someones husband someones partner and it is absolutely shameful now we heard yesterday on the steps of the capitol a terrifying story from a woman whose 10yearold daughter was murdered by someone with a gun someone who couldnt legally buy a gun because he couldnt pass a background check he was a felon but he got around that law because he went online he found the same gun that you could buy in a gun store online but without the requirement to pass a background check he bought that gun he shot that brave woman and he murdered her daughter we can take a step today to do something about that we can bring up the background check bill it is bipartisan prosecond amendment it has 186 coauthors in this house we can bring it up for a vote and we can pass it that will provide the first line of defense against people who shouldnt be able to buy guns from buying guns who are these people criminals domestic abusers terrorists those who are dangerously mentally ill they should not be able to get their hands on a gun now can we stop it in every instance no but we know that background checks work we know that we can make a real difference every day every day in the united states of america 170 felons are stopped from buying guns because of the background check program every day in the united states of america 50 domestic abusers are stopped from buying a gun because of the background check system it works we know it works why wont we bring that bill up for a vote that woman stood on the steps of the capitol yesterday that was a courageous stand she took she lost her daughter she watched her daughter be murdered right in front of her eyes she herself was shot

is going on with background checks the policy is solid they work one hundred and seventy felons a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks fifty domestic abusers a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks it sounds like pretty solid policy to me it must be the politics on the other side that are getting in the way and the american people do not want that to continue ninety percent of the people who we represent are with us they say that criminals terrorists domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill should not be able to get guns and

national network to end domestic violence twenty years ago we worked with a bipartisan congress to pass the domestic violence offender gun ban it became law in 1996 it was known as the lautenberg amendment after the late senator frank lautenberg of new jersey since that time we have made a lot of progress in preventing domestic violence but sadly there are several mack trucksize loopholes that prevent the law from coming to its full effect in fact just last week in a fight against the gun lobby yet again over these last 20 years the supreme court upheld the domestic violence offender gun ban in a 62 decision as many know leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time for a domestic violence victim and adding a firearm to that situation severely heightens the risk of injury or death in fact in america the majority of fatal domestic violence homicides are committed with firearms at least 52 percent of american women murdered with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members despite impressions from media coverage mass shootings in which at least four people are murdered with a gun are also typically acts of domestic or family violence an everytown usa analysis of every mass shooting between 2009 and 2015 found that 57 percent were committed by intimate partners or the family of victims research shows that commonsense gun laws have a marked effect on improving womens safety from gun violence in states that require background checks for all handgun sales 46 percent fewer women are murdered with a gun by an intimate partner and state laws ensuring that convicted abusers or those subject to domestic violence restraining orders are separated from their firearms are also associated with reductions in gun violence against women but because of loopholes in these laws and failures to enforce them they do little to curb the uniquely lethal american problem of guns and violence against women four gaps in the law are particularly harmful first federal law does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of abusive dating partners or convicted stalkers the federal law prohibits domestic abusers from buying or owning guns but doesnt apply to dangerous people convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses or to dating partners even though more women in the unitedstates are killed by their dating partners than their spouses second in 35 states state law does not prohibit all people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes and all people subject to restraining orders from buying or using guns third and importantly federal law allows domestic abusers and stalkers to easily evade gun prohibitions by purchasing guns from unlicensed private sellers that is the mack truck loophole federal law only requires background checks for gun sales at licensed dealers sixteen states require checks on all handgun sales but in the remaining states prohibited abusers seeking to avoid a background check have very little trouble purchasing a gun from an unlicensed dealer they meet online at a gun show or in a parking lot prohibited domestic abusers know about this loophole and they have taken advantage of it to deadly effect and in fact in a firstofitskind investigation of illegal gun sales mayors against illegal guns found that one in four prohibited purchasers seeking guns online had a domestic violence arrest finally 41 states do not require prohibited abusers to relinquish the guns they already own so i have joined in legislation to prohibit these guns from falling into the hands of domestic abusers we know that a proven way to help with people who are not eligible to purchase guns such as felons and domestic abusers is to expand and strengthen universal background checks on all firearms sales no matter where that sale takes place and very tragically our lax gun laws make it easier for abusers to acquire a firearm than it is in fact to purchase a box of sudafed so you ask why do we protest why did we take the dramatic action of taking to the floor of this house it is because we have had enough and we know that working together we can and must change the fact that women across this country lose their lives to gun violence by their domestic abusers nine american women are shot and killed by their husbands and intimate partners every single week we can do something about it lets close the gun show

sorts of misinformation and distortions on this floor about planned parenthood which is an organization that provides women and their families with health care that provides cancer screenings and that provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of other committees here yet our republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt special committee to go after planned parenthood ironically they claim to be doing an investigation but here on the floor they have obviously already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an organization that helps provide health care to american women and families so rolled into one bill you have something that would deny access to health care to 22 million americans and at the same time deny important health services to millions of american women and their families when our republican colleagues pose this question and say that the president is going to be faced

are fortunate that today we have a president who will not sign that bill but who will instead veto that bill our colleagues are absolutely right if you had a different president including as far as i

them and talk about them on the floor of the house so tonight this is what we will do i would like to mention the mission of the naacp which is to ensure the political educational social and economic equality of all personsnot just of black people not just of people of color but of all people the naacp also desires to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination these are lofty and noble goals because we understand that we have had much racial hatred and much racial discrimination in this country and the naacp took it upon itself to eliminate as much of it as possible it has done a good job i might add lets look at a little bit of the history of the naacp back on february 12 1909 a group of people decided that it was going to do something about the lynchings that were taking place in this country literally in this country between 1889 and 1918 thousands of african americans were lynchedthousands lynching was done with mob violence people were taken to trees and they were lynched it was done a good many times with impunity no one was ever prosecuted it was a grave injustice and there were people in this country who decided that they were going to do something about this injustice among the people who met initially were mary white ovington oswald garrison villard william english walling and ida wellsbarnett these persons met and issued a clarion call some 60 persons answered that call hence the naacp was born the naacp did not have its first african american as an executive secretary until 1920 it is important for us to note that many of the founders of the naacpin fact most of themwere not of african ancestry the first executive secretaries of the organization were all persons who were of european ancestry in fact the first five executive secretaries were white they were not black in 1934 the naacp had its first black board chairpersonlouis t wright dr wright became chairperson after the naacp had had a good number of white chairpersons so the naacp has never been and is not now an organization for blacks only the naacp has always stood for an integrated society and has been an integrated organization since its inception in 1954 the naacp under the leadership and counsel of the honorable thurgood marshall who became a justice of the supreme court won the lawsuit of brown v board of education this was a giant leap forward for us because this lawsuit integrated to a certain extent schools throughout the country the word that was appropriately used at the time was desegregated these schools were ordered to be desegregated with all deliberate speed and all deliberate speed can sometimes take a lot longer than one might expect a good many years later there are still those who would contend that we have not fully integrated our school systems across the length and breadth of the country in 1955 an naacp member the honorable rosa parks an african american lady decided that she was going to take a stand and she took that stand by taking a seat she took a seat on a bus in so doing she ignited a spark that started a civil rights movement by the way there are many people who contend that she did this because she was tired well she may have been tired but she did it because she wanted to take a stand she was tired of societys relegating her to the back of the bus and she took a stand against it hence we had the montgomery bus boycott which lasted more than a year at the end of that boycott the bus linethe transportation systemwas integrated in alabama and of course later on throughout the country an interesting note on this point about the integration and desegregation of bus lines there was a threejudge panel that actually heard the litigation associated with this transportation issue on that threejudge panel there were judges who had a great debate about this but there was one frank m johnson a federal district court judge who took the position that we could apply the brown decision to public transportation this was the very first time it was done was under the leadership of that threejudge panel and by the honorable frank m johnson again i point these things out because it is important to note that there were others who were there with the naacp to help us along the way frank m johnson by the way was a republican appointee who was appointed by president eisenhower and he went on to help us to integrate schools throughout the south and integrate the department of public safety he went on to help us with the facilitation of voting rights acts and with the implementation of laws that prohibited persons from discriminating against persons in workplace environments he really played a significant role as did many other persons who were associated with the naacp in a vicarious way because i dont have evidence of his having been a member i want to move forward if i may next to 2008 i move forward to 2008 because this is when the naacp supported the passage of the emmett till unsolved civil rights crime act of 2007 there are many unsolved cases in the history of this country with reference to things that happened to african americans the naacp pushed for and supported legislation such that we can have the opportunity to bring some of the dastards to justice who have caused great harm to people who were doing no harm to anyone the naacp has fought for this in 2009 the naacp celebrated its centennial anniversary and the theme at that time was bold dreams and big victories obviously a good theme because the naacp has won many big victories in 2012 the naacp supported the smart and safe campaign which brought attention to the overpopulated prisons and mass incarceration in this country people who study these issues are well aware that in this country we have an overpopulation of persons who are incarcerated much of this has to do with mandatory sentencing laws much of it has to do with laws that allow persons who are convicted of one type of offense with drugs to receive a harsher penaltycocaine for example then if you have crack cocaine you will get a stiffer penalty as opposed to its being some other type of cocaine the point is that these harsh sentencing laws have caused a good many people to be incarcerated who quite frankly should not be incarcerated for as long as they are incarcerated some of these three strikes and you are out laws have also caused persons to go to prison for a minor offense because it happened to be the third offense so the naacp is fighting against this"], [0.9873026609420776, 0.9873026609420776,
