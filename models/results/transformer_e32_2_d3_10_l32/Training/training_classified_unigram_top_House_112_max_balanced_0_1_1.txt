budget is all about i will say that i am getting unconfused because his budget is a destruction of the fabric and the way of life of all americans do you want to know what the republican budget does it cuts food assistance for struggling families it takes away affordable health care coverage for working families and of course it dismantles the health care safety net but also it deals with the education of our children as the cochair and founder of the congressional childrens caucus let me show you what happens when we dont educate our children we can see the numbers of individuals who are unemployed who have not had a high school degree our friends and the republican budget are going to cut education and theyre going to wind up with increasing unemployment because you can see that less of our americans are being able to go to college and therefore without college without a high school education we just undermine a growing childs opportunity let me tell you what else we do we go from children to their grandparents i remember standing on the floor of this house trying to prevent the doughnut hole from coming about but republicans again established a doughnut hole that millions of seniors have fallen through in fact the republican budget causes seniors to pay some 12 000 on their medicare listen to me clearly seniors you will be paying an extra 12 000 with the republican budget plan and of course we will open up the doughnut hole again the very doughnut hole that has been taken care of by the affordable care act on the other hand the democratic budget balances the budget and of course it recognizes the value of a shared sacrifice i just visited texas soldiers national guard they understand about shared sacrifice they support each other but this is a suicidal budget it has no shared sacrifice and all of the cuts come from the most vulnerable the republican plan is all about turning back the clock and throwing the poor people over the bridge that is what its all about it is a disgrace vote for the democratic budget mr chair i rise in opposition to the republican budget for fiscal year 2012 and beyond unlike the proposed democratic budget the republican budget purports to reduce our nations deficit by making disturbingly deep cuts to important programs and will have an adverse affect on our nations families children and the health of women the republican budget guts food assistance for struggling families the budget resolution calls for 127 billion in cuts to snap formerly called food stamps in a sixyear period 2015 through 2021 this proposal to blockgrant and reduce funding represents a cut of 25 percent in food benefits for some of the most vulnerable americans states will be forced to cut benefits to some households or create waiting lists for needy families takes away affordable health coverage for millions of working families the majoritys budget resolution calls for 1 4 trillion in savings from repealing coverage provisions of the affordable care act which congress enacted a year ago to hold insurance companies accountable and extend health coverage to more than 30 million americans who would otherwise be uninsured this would mean repealing 777 billion in tax credits to help low and middleincome families afford health insurance coverage dismantles health care safety net for vulnerable populations the majoritys budget devastates health security for 28 million poor children 5 million seniors and 10 million disabled individuals who rely on medicaid for a basic safety net of health care to protect tax cuts for the wealthy the budget includes the absurd idea to dismantle the medicaid program and to let the chips fall where they may no matter who might get hurt the real hard choices are left to others state governors who will decide which populations or health services to drop health care providers whose medicaid payments might get cut so low they will have to decide whether they can afford to continue providing services to medicaid beneficiaries lowincome families who may have to decide between buying groceries and taking a sick child to a doctor and adults with aging parents who may have to decide between sending a child to college or paying for their parents longterm care the democratic budget democratic budget reduces the deficit responsibly reaches primary balance by 2018 the democratic budget reduces the deficit by 1 2 trillion more than the presidents budget over ten years includes pell grant and supplemental nutrition assistance snap initiatives the democratic budget includes two mandatory initiatives that are fully paid for with spending reductions first it includes the presidents proposed mandatory funding to sustain the maximum pell grant award at 5 550 in contrast to the republican budget which cuts pell grant funding substantially the democratic budget protects medicaid and the medicare guarantee for seniors the democratic budget protects medicares guarantee of health care coverage for seniors and disabled workers it also preserves the existing structure of medicaid that provides a health care safety net for vulnerable children families seniors and persons with disabilities in contrast the republican budget dismantles medicaid and ends medicare by converting it into an inadequate voucher for the purchase of private insurance i would urge all members of congress to oppose the republican budget and instead support the democratic budget to responsibly cut spending and give americas families women and children a chance"], [0.0010867118835449219,

alternative to the republican budget that is mr van hollens budget proposal that is a statement of our national values that says to the american people what is important to you about the education health and wellbeing of our children the economic security of their families and the health security of our seniors those are important values to us and those values are reflected in the democratic alternative the republican ryan bill on the other hand i do not believe is a statement of our national values as to what is important to the american people as reflected in their budget priorities but you be the judge would it be a statement of your values if you had a budget that said to seniors were going to end the medicare guarantee and youre going to pay 6 000 or more while you get less in terms of benefits while at the same time were going to give an over 300 billion tax break to the wealthiest people in our country would that be a statement of your values this 6 000 more for seniors with fewer benefits 300 000 or more to the richest people in our country would it be a statement of your values for you my colleagues and the american people you represent if you had a budget that said to big oil were going to continue to subsidize you to the tune of tens of billions of dollars but at the same time were going to freeze pell grants were going to eliminate them for 400 000 young people and make them less available to over 9 million young people lower the benefits for some eliminate it for others and use the money to give tax subsidies to big oil big oil which is making tens of billions of dollars in record profits each year would it be a statement of your values if you said in your budget that all of those young people who are now children who have a preexisting medical conditionasthma diabetes birth defectany of those preexisting medical conditions under present law under the affordable care act they may not be discriminated against in obtaining health insurance but the republican budget says they should be because were going to eliminate that to the 2 5 million young people who are now on their parents policies until theyre 26 years old this budget says no to you too were eliminating that were too busy giving tax breaks to the richest people in america and while were at it with young people just graduating from college some of them may have student loans and in the house budgetthank you mr van hollenin the house budget we have a provision that says that come july 1 the interest on those loans will not double we have taken care of that under the circumstances the path were on the interest rates would go from 3 4 percent to 6 8 percent the house democratic budget says no to that doubling of interest the republican budget keeps it the same thats just to name a few things that i think may not be a statement of the values of the american people whether its interest paid on student loans availability of pell grants to young people ending the medicare guarantee and as the distinguished ranking member said right now today overturning the resources that were put in the affordable care act to reduce to narrow the doughnut hole maybe 5 million seniors have benefited to the tune of 3 2 billion already in the bill also there are preventative services there are annual wellness visits without a copay so were talking about kitchen table items for people where people are trying to make ends meet where people wonder about if their children will be able to go to college and if they do will they be able to have health insurance so that when they look for a job they can reach their aspirations without having their choices only narrowed by whether they have health insurance or not until the bill comes into full effect so there are just a couple of things that i would want people to know about this bill they are ends the medicare guarantee ends the medicare guarantee ends the medicare guarantee while making seniors pay more for less while giving over 300 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country and by the way did i mention it its a job loser so i urge my colleagues to enthusiastically support the house democratic proposal which is a statement of our values and which our distinguished colleague will presenti dont know if its tonight or tomorrow morning i understand that it keeps changing the house democratic alternative invests in americas priorities creates jobs protects our seniors and our students strengthens the middle class democrats protect medicare republicans dismantle medicare the democratic plan asks the wealthiest to pay their fair share and put our fiscal house in order the republican plan gives them more than the tax break theyve had they almost double their tax break our democratic plan reflects the most enduring theme in america the american dream democrats want to reignite the american dream to build ladders of opportunity for all who want to work hard play by the rules and take responsibility it does this by investing in small businesses and entrepreneurialism in our country by strengthening the middle class in that regard we believe that our budget is a statement of our values we call upon our republican colleagues to work with us on a budget that reflects our values we must work together to protect and strengthen medicare we must put people back to work and build a broadly shaped prosperity for all americans we must make it in america to stop the erosion of our manufacturing base we must rebuild america putting people back to work we must do this with community involvement and all of these things strengthen the middle class which is exactly what our democratic alternative achieves for the sake of our seniors for our families for our children for our workers i urge my colleagues to vote no on the republican plan which ends the medicare guarantee and makes seniors pay 6 000 or more for fewer benefits while it gives 300 000 in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the united states and it costs us jobs to do so and doesnt reduce the deficit until nearly 2040 its not a good deal for the american people the democratic budget is

large corporations over 10 years it would pay for it by closing unspecified tax loopholes but this is a fraud for loophole closing of this magnitude the republicans would have to get rid of all the tax breaks the middle class depends on loopholes like the mortgage interest deduction the tax exclusion for employersponsored health insurance and charitable donations this wont happen which is why the republicans wont name any of their loophole closings the republican budget then proposes 5 3 trillion in nondefense discretionary spending cuts beyond what was agreed to in last years debt ceiling 1 2 trillion beyond it would slash 860 billion from medicare and all to pay for tax cuts because it wouldnt balance the budget until 2040 because these cuts are to pay for the tax cuts for the wealthy for shame mr chair i rise in strong opposition to the republican budget for fy13 as offered by mr ryan last year the republicans moved a slashandburn budget proposal that would have eliminated medicare and substituted for it a private voucher system and would have implemented devastating cuts to medicaid education programs medical research and transportation among other things you name it they wanted to devastate it now we turn to this years republican budget proposal and as one famous new yorker would say its d6ja vu all over again first the republican budget calls for a staggering 10

anticipate balancing the budget until 2040 but they make devastating spending cutsnot to balance the budget but to pay for their tax cuts for the wealthy what priorities the republican budget seeks even deeper spending cuts than last years proposal it proposes 5 3 trillion in nondefense discretionary spending cuts 1 2 trillion 22 percent beyond the cuts agreed to in last years debt ceiling deal more than 60 percent of these cuts would come on the backs of middle and lowincome families for example the republican budget would slash 860 billion 34 percent from the medicaid program while turning it into an unguaranteed block grant these severe cuts would shift the cost burden to the states who would have to decide between investing even more of their own money cutting benefits shifting the cost onto beneficiaries doctors and hospitals throwing people out of the program or all of these the urban institute estimated that the republican plan would result in between 14 and 27 million people being dropped from medicaid by 2021 additionally the ryan budget would reduce food stamps by 134 billion knocking 8 to 10 million people from the program and leaving them to go hungry wic which provides nutritional assistance to women and children would also be cut taking food out of the mouths of 700 000 pregnant women new moms and their kids over the next decade nearly two million women and children would be left without access to critical food what kind of cruel and heartless country do the republicans want us to live in seniors on medicare dont fare much better first republicans would raise the eligibility age to 67 leaving seniors aged 65 and 66 out in the cold they would force seniors to go it alone in negotiating with private insurance companies for coverage seniors would receive vouchers to offset the cost of private insurancevouchers whose value would increase much more slowly than the cost of buying medical insurance cbo estimates that within ten years seniors would have to pay 6 000 more out of pocket for medical care annually all this mind you while promising to do away with all of the provisions in the affordable care act like medical ratio requirements which actually help to stem the cost of private insurance dont look to the republican plan for investments in infrastructure medical research or educationprimary or collegiate for students or for teachersbecause they are not there and the republican budget would greatly increase unemployment according to the economic policy institute republican spending cuts would result in the loss of 1 3 million jobs next year and an additional 2 8 million jobs the year after that thats 4 1 million jobs lost in just two years thereby eviscerating all the jobs added to the economy in the last 23 months

students seniors and the poor a budget is a reflection of priorities it exemplifies objectives and goals the republicans priorities are clear cut taxes for the most wealthy americans while achieving

go hungry without snap it would support our economy through investment in transportation and infrastructure and would encourage american innovation the republican budget would reject investments in innovation by cutting funding for research and development it would ignore the benefits of these investments on future generations should the republican budget go into effect we would miss a great opportunity to support american innovation and to develop emerging technologies that create the jobs of the future in addition the republican budget would fail our students by proposing drastic cuts that would devastate education funding and increase costs for college students it would allow higher interest rates on student loans starting this year and eliminate the incomebased repayment plans that help graduates manage their loans in contrast to the republican budget the cbc budget would increase the maximum pell grant by nearly 1 000 and invest an additional 25 billion above the presidents budget in education and job training in fiscal year 2013 alleviating state and local education budget cuts and protecting jobs for teachers even the middle class is not spared from the republican cuts the republican budget would outsource jobs through tax policies it would actually encourage multinational companies to ship thousands of jobs overseas while costing the american economy billions of dollars by contrast the cbc budget would ensure that wall street bankers pay the same tax rates as working americans by taxing carried interest dividends and capital gains as ordinary income the cbc budget would close corporate tax loopholes adding approximately 1 3 trillion in revenue over 10 years just like last year the republican budget would end the medicare guarantee and shift costs to seniors rather than having the guaranteed coverage of benefits seniors would receive a voucher yet the voucher will not grow as quickly as health care costssimply shift costs on to seniors as the aarp pointed out the premium support method described in the republican proposal would likely price out traditional medicare as a viable option thus rendering the choice of traditional medicare as a false promise the cbc budget would support our seniors working americans and the middle class and the cbc budget will reduce the deficit by an additional 3 4 trillion as compared to the

throwing people off the rolls would make it practically impossible for people to afford a nutritionally sound diet for 2 years in a row weve seen republican priorities in the republican vision for the

and education are becoming more expensive for the average american families are fighting to save their homes from foreclosure and escape from under mountains of debt instead of focusing on these important issues mr ryan and the tea party have developed a budget that dramatically undermines the social safety net that so many americans depend on i believe that budgets are reflections of our valuesand it is clear from this proposal that mr ryan and the tea party do not possess the same values as ordinary americans by turning medicare into a voucher program this budget would effectively end medicare as we know it and shift thousands of dollars of health costs onto seniors but gutting medicare is not enough for the republicans the ryan budget would also cut more than 1 trillion from medicaid and endanger health care coverage for over 60 million americans including lowincome children pregnant women nursing home patients and persons with disabilities this budget also demonstrates the republicans lack of commitment to investing in americas youth by proposing to cut funding for education by 45 percent it is clear that the republicans do not understand the importance of investing

part about it is many of them are just waking up this morning to the nightmare that faces them and why is that because the republican budget proposal released this week is literally balanced on the fragile backs of our nations seniors thats right it ends medicare as we know it thats the simple truth it no longer honors our commitment and our promise to our nations seniors as americans now know we are in the midst of a serious budget battle and the republicans are even threatening to shut down government and there are real differences between our approach to the budget and the republican budget released earlier this week the republican budget replaces medicare with a voucher system seniors will have to use this voucher to buy insurance from private insurance companies under the republican plan medicare as we know it will end and in the same budget proposal the republicans give away tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to big oil companies and under their plan they will slash support for seniors in nursing homes while giving away tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and what else americas seniors more than 150 000 in my home state of rhode island will literally be paying more for their health care and getting less in order to provide additional tax breaks to the wealthiest americans also reflected in this republican budget to make matters worse the republican plan does not reduce the deficit the nonpartisan congressional budget office determined that this budget actually adds 8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade because its cuts in spending are far outpaced by the gigantic tax cuts for the richest americans our seniors cannot afford this republican budget it would deny them health care longterm care and the benefits theyve earned and deserve the republicans choice to privatize medicare turning more power over to the insurance companies will result in reduced coverage and exposure to greater financial risks for our seniors the congressional budget office determined that under the republican budget seniors outofpocket expenses for health care would more than double and could almost triple to put that into context the congressional budget office found out that by 2030 seniors would pay 68 percent of premiums and outofpocket costs under the republican plan compared to only 25 percent under current law and it found that the republican plan means seniors will pay more for their prescription drugs because it reestablishes the doughnut hole even alice rivlin the former office of management and budget director under president clinton who worked with the republican architect of this budget on a deficit reduction proposal said she could not support his medicare proposal because it eliminated the traditional medicare choice and lowered the rate of growth beyond whats defensible and the conservative wall street journal concluded earlier this week quote the plan would essentially end medicare which now pays for 48 million elderly and disabled americans as a program that directly pays those bills under the guise of deficit reduction republicans are recklessly attacking the vital supports for our seniors we all agree that we have to address the deficit the issue is not whether we reduce the deficit but how we do it we cant cut what helps us create jobs innovate for the future and remain competitive in the global marketplace and we cannot balance this budget on the backs of our nations seniors the federal budget is about more than dollars and cents its a statement of our values and priorities as a nation republicans in this budget have set the wrong priorities they would rather cut benefits to seniors than cut subsidies to big oil or corporations that ship our jobs overseas the republican budget breaks the promise we made to our seniors to protect them in their golden years i say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle if we cant protect our greatest generation i ask you whats

in the committee and i look forward to a debate on the floor because as the chairman said we have very deep differences we do not have a difference on the question of whether or not we should reduce the deficits and the debt of course we do we have a difference over how to do that in that regard i rise in strong opposition to this republican plan and in support of the democratic alternative the republican budget on the floor of the house today is simply the sequel to last years planmore of the same it abandons the economic recovery and ends the medicare guarantee for individuals whose median income is under 21 000 while providing a whopping average tax break of almost 400 000 for people making over 1 million a year these tax breaks for the very wealthy and the tax breaks for special interests come at the expense of middleincome taxpayers at the expense of seniors and at the expense of essential investments to keep america strong this republican plan will weaken economic growth and according to independent analysts result in over 2 million jobs lost over the next 2 years it rewards corporations that ship american jobs overseas while slashing investments in education in scientific research and infrastructure that help america grow our economy right here at home in short it is a path to greater prosperity if you are already wealthy while leaving seniors working americans and future generations behind we gather here at a very important time for our country as a result of the extraordinary actions taken over the last 4 years and the tenacity of the american people and small businesses america avoided a second great depression and the economy is slowly recovering still millions of americans remain out of work through no fault of their own we must push forward with the recovery not fall back and we certainly should not return to the failed economic policies that got america into this economic mess to begin with and yet that is exactly what this republican budget does it is a recipe for national stagnation and decline it retreats from our national goal of outeducating outbuilding and outcompeting the rest of the world and it will weaken the economic recovery by slashing investments to important economic growth and expanding those tax breaks that reward corporations that ship american jobs overseas even when we have 17 percent unemployment in the construction industry it cuts critical investments in our transportation systems including a 46 percent cut in transportation starting next year as i mentioned earlier nonpartisan analysts looked at this and concluded it would lose 2 million jobs over 2 years so rather than putting the economy into reverse we need to move forward we need to adopt the remainder of the presidents jobs plan a plan thats been sitting here in the house since september its also clear that putting america back to work is the fastest and most effective way to reduce deficits in the short term in fact the congressional budget office estimates that our weak economy and underemployment is the single major contributing factor to the deficit this year accounting for over onethird of the projected 2012 deficit so we need to come up with a credible plan the issue as i said is not whether but how every bipartisan group that has looked at ways to reduce the deficit in a credible way has recommended a balanced approach meaning a combination of spending cuts and cuts to tax breaks for the wealthy and the elimination of special interest corporate tax loopholes the democratic alternative provides that balanced approach while the republican plan unfortunately fails that test instead their plan would again rig the rules in favor of the very wealthy and special interests that may not be a surprise since virtually every house republican has signed a pledgea pledgeto grover norquist saying they will not close a single special interest tax loophole not eliminate a single oil subsidy for the purpose of deficit reduction not one penny i agree with the gentleman from wisconsin that we face a real deficit and debt problem apparently the problem is not big enough to ask folks at the very high end of the income scale to contribute one penny toward deficit reduction in addition to locking in those parts of the bush tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the very wealthy they now have a new round of tax cuts that will provide on average a 400 000 tax cut for people making over 1 million a year thats according to the nonpartisan tax policy center so heres the key because our republican colleagues refuse to ask millionaires to contribute 1 cent to deficit reduction they hit everyone and everything else lets take a look at medicare recipients they immediately increase costs to seniors for medicare preventive services and terminate a new service the wellness programs that were part of the affordable care act they immediately reduce support to seniors in the prescription drug plan by reopening the doughnut hole that decision will cost seniors with high drug costs an average of 10 000 over the next 10 years once again this republican budget does not reform medicare it deforms it it proposes to end the medicare guarantee shifting rising costs onto seniors and disabled individuals it gives you the equivalent of a voucher but if your voucher amount is not sufficient to pay for the rising cost of health care too bad too bad it simply rations your health care and choice of doctor by income and leaves seniors to the whims of the insurance industry despite claims that market competition is going to bring down those rising costs the plan creates that artificial cap on the voucher support our republican colleagues say theyre using the part d prescription drug plan as a model but that has no artificial cap they say its the same kind of plan offered to members of congress under the federal employee health benefit plan but that has no cap on support from their plans so unlike members of congress seniors in medicare will get vouchers with declining purchasing power relative to rising health care costs in fact if you look at this chart you will see what the current medicare plan would provide in terms of the amount of support provided by the plan to the individual on health care thats the blue line this is the green line federal employee health benefit plan the plan that members of congress are on as you can see the amount of the premium support keeps pace with rising health care costs this red line is the republican voucher plan that caps the amount an individual can receive and goes steadily downward giving seniors on medicare a worse deal than members of congress would give to themselves now this budget also rips apart the safety net for seniors in nursing homes and assisted living facilities as well as lowincome kids and individuals with disabilities who rely on medicaid remember twothirds of medicaid funding goes to seniors in nursing homes and disabled individuals yet that is one of the biggest areas of the republican budget cuts it takes a hatchet to medicaid slashing over 800 billion and cutting medicaid by onethird by the year 2022 this is done under the orwellian title in their plan of repairing the social safety net thats like throwing an anchor to a drowning person to govern is to choose and thats what this debate is all about the choices in this republican budget are simply wrong for america it is not bold to provide tax breaks to millionaires while ending the medicare guarantee for seniors and sticking them with the bill for rising health care costs its not courageous to protect tax giveaways to big oil companies and other special interests while slashing investments in our kids education scientific research and critical infrastructure it is not visionary to reward corporations that ship american jobs overseas while terminating affordable health care for tens of millions of americans it is certainly not brave to cut support for seniors in nursing homes individuals with disabilities and poor kids and it is not fair to raise taxes on middleincome americans financed by another round of tax breaks for the very wealthy yet those are the choices made in this republican budget where is the shared responsibility we can and we must do better lets reject this budget and adopt the democratic alternative which provides a balanced approach to accomplishing the goal of reducing our deficits while at the same time strengthening our economy and doing it in a way that calls for shared

irresponsible it would hurt americas seniors while giving enormous tax breaks to the top 2 percent of the wealthiest americans it does nothing to create jobs but gives billions in corporate loopholes and subsidies to big oil most notably the republican plan would literally end medicare and while this may be a new plan these are not new ideas the republicans 2012 budget attempts to do to medicare what president bush wanted to do to social security in 2005privatize it and severely cut benefits can you imagine if we had privatized social security in 2005 the way the republicans wanted to do just before the biggest financial collapse since the great depression is that what we really want to do with medicare we cannot afford to have wall street control the fate of our seniors the republican plan would convert medicare into a voucher program that forces seniors to buy costly private insurance plans it asks seniors half of whom have less than 19 000 a year in total income to pay more and get less if this plan were put in place the nonpartisan congressional budget office has estimated that the average senior would end up paying nearly three times more outofpocket expenses meanwhile the health care law enacted last year is already helping to close the gap in prescription drug coverage known as the doughnut hole and provides annual exams and preventive services but a repeal of the health care law as the republican budget plan calls for would eliminate these benefits these benefits for medicare patients are making a real difference in the lives of my constituents i recently heard from a 71yearold woman from sacramento who requires several expensive drugs to maintain her health in october of 2010 she was worried about her ability to pay for her medication because she fell into the coverage gap but she was relieved to learn that she would get 250 in 2010 and that 50 percent of her costs would be reimbursed this year and even more would be reimbursed in the future but now republicans want to pull the rug out from under our seniors and their families what is astonishing to me is that in addition to privatization of medicare the republican plan also goes after medicaid instead of making real reform to the medicaid program the republican budget calls for converting medicaid into a block grant program that would sharply reduce funding for seniors and lowincome americans on medicaid so that it would not keep up with health care costs medicaid helps keep our seniors in their homes and helps them afford nursing homes if they need them but the republican plan would leave seniors on their own and ignores the promise that our country has made from one generation to another the federal budget should reflect our american values that have been passed down for generations where seniors earn the benefits that they have paid into and have been promised and are able to enjoy their retirement after working hard in their careers that is why i will continue to fight to protect the dignity of americas seniors and protect them against the devastating effects of the republican budget proposal"], [0.0012785792350769043, 0.9987214207649231, 1, "i rise in opposition to the amendment and in defense of our nations seniors who are really under attack why is that because the current republican budget proposal passed by this house and up for senate consideration pulls the rug out from underneath our seniors it ends medicare by making huge cuts in benefits and by putting insurance companies in charge of our seniors health care letting insurers decide what treatment and what tests our seniors will receive under the republican plan medicare will end it will not only impact our seniors it will impact the family members of our seniors who will now have those responsibilities it will reopen the doughnut hole making it more expensive for our seniors to get their prescriptions the prescriptions they need to keep them healthy and under their plan they will slash support for seniors in nursing homes while continuing to give subsidies in the billions of dollars to big oil companies and what else more than 170 000 rhode islanders which is my home state rely on medicare and they will literally be paying to give additional tax breaks to the wealthiest americans in our country to make matters worse the nonpartisan congressional budget office determined that this budget actually adds 8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade because its cuts in spending are outpaced by the gigantic tax cuts for the richest americans our seniors cannot afford this republican budget it would deny them health care longterm care and the benefits that they have earned the republicans choice to end medicare by cutting benefits and by turning power over to the insurance companies for the important health care decisions of our seniors will result in reduced coverage and an exposure to greater financial risk for medicare recipients costing seniors an estimated 6 000 more each year for their care the congressional budget office determined that under this republican budget seniors outofpocket expenses for health care would more than double and could almost triple they concluded most elderly people would pay more for their health care under the republican plan than they would pay under the current medicare system to put that into context the cbo found that in 2030 seniors would pay 68 percent of premiums and outofpocket costs under the republican plan compared to only 25 percent under current law and it found that the republican plan means seniors will pay more for their prescription drugs because it reopens the doughnut hole costing each of the 4 million seniors who fall into that coverage gap up to 9 300 by the conservative wall street journal concluded that this plan would essentially end medicare which now pays for 48 million elderly and disabled americans as a program that directly pays those bills under the guise of deficit reduction this republican plan is recklessly attacking vital support systems for our seniors we all agree that we have to address the deficit the issue isnt whether we should reduce it but rather how we do it lets repeal subsidies to big oil lets eliminate fraud and waste lets end the wars that are costing us more than 2 billion a week we should not be balancing the budget on the backs of our nations seniors the federal budget is about more than just dollars and cents it is a statement of our values and our priorities as a country the republican budget reflects the wrong priorities it would rather cut benefits to our seniors than cut subsidies to big oil or corporations that ship our jobs overseas by ending medicare this republican budget breaks the promise we made to our seniors to protect them in their golden years we must do better for our seniors medicare has met the health care needs of seniors while providing them with financial stability for more than 40 years ending medicare would pull the rug out from underneath the feet of our seniors during their golden years so i ask my colleagues if we cant protect our greatest generation whats next i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0012961626052856445, 0.9987038373947144, 1, "first let me just say i am shocked and appalled at the comment yesterday by the speaker when he said so be it in response to the likely job losses that will occur as a result of this continuing resolution an independent analysis by the nonpartisan economic policy institute indicates that this bill will result in the direct loss mind you of 800 000 private and public sector jobs instead of doing everything we can do to halt the loss of jobs and put people back to work this bill takes the wrong approach putting our economy and our country back on the path to recession for every job opening in this country we have 4 7 unemployed people who are looking for work why would we want to add to their numbers so be it cannot and should not be our response to this economic crisis not with a 9 percent unemployment rate and over 15 percent in communities of color and record layoffs and furloughs at the state level and especially not when republicans have the temerity to demand tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires paid for through borrowed money this is just wrong and its immoral as a member of the house appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services and education i am in strong opposition to these cruel cuts budgets are moral documents and they are a reflection of who we are and what we value this spending bill makes it clear that the poor the young women the elderly teachers firefighters cops and the communities that they protect and serve are not valued make no mistake this bill will harm the most vulnerable among us and it represents a wrongheaded approach to reducing the deficit or expanding job growth in our country i am especially concerned about the proposed cuts to education and training programs among the range of cuts include workforce investment act programs which last year helped over 8 4 million job seekers find jobs they got additional education and job training support this is being cut all told when counting rescissions of prior funding elimination of the requested fy11 funding and the advanced funding needed to run these employment and training programs they will experience nearly a 5 billion cut republican cuts in job training will only prolong the recession keep unemployment high and keep more americans collecting unemployment instead of training and getting ready for our 21st century job opportunities how can we justify cutting job training programs in the middle of an economic crisis how will my republican colleagues respond to the unemployed in their communities who come to them and ask them for help will they just say so be it pell grants pell grants provide vital funds for students who wish to attend 2 and 4year colleges but who need help to pay their expenses in my district alone there are 16 institutions that provide pell grants to over 18 000 recipients this proposal would cut pell grants by 845 making college less affordable and accessible for lowand moderateincome students more than 8 million students benefit from pell grants and many would be hurt by this cut especially as schools are raising tuition fees to meet rising costs and to deal with tighter budgets the bill also entirely eliminates federal funding for supplemental educational opportunity grants which colleges and universities use to assist undergraduates who have the greatest financial need that program assisted 1 3 million college students last year head start under this proposal is cut by nearly 1 1 billion this will effectively knock out 200 000 children mind you in republican and democratic districts from participating in this critical early education program this helps provide health nutrition and supportive services to prepare our children for school the job corps program this program is cut by 891 million which will result in 21 384 jobs lost in communities in every state the majority of which are in the private sector there will be 1 7 billion lost in economic activity as a result of this and 36 000 atrisk young people will be turned away from job corps costing the government and the economy as much as 17 billion over the course of their lifetimes additionally the cuts will guarantee the closure mind you of 75 job corps centers across the nation in your districts and in our districts slashing one of the most effective accountable and marketdriven solutions for millions of youth who leave our schools unprepared is really the wrong move at the wrong time the majority has stated that they want to cut the deficit but in effect they are cutting the social safety net lifeline for those who need it the most this cr leads us down a path that will result in hopelessness joblessness and desperation and it destroys the future for our young people i urge my colleagues to meet the challenge before us and reverse the potential harm that will be inevitable if this bill is enacted i yield back the balance of

progressive caucus budget came up the black caucus budget came up i think mr mulvaney came up with a budget proposal they put the presidentsa very very watered down and inaccurate version of the presidents budget up there and weve been talking budget when we talk about the budget what were talking about is the values and priorities of america its important to keep this in mind what shows up in your budget is what you care about what does not show up in your budget is what you dont care about now i always caution people not to just take their family budget and the united states budget and assume theyre basically the same thing one just is bigger than the other thats not exactly accurate there are important differences and we shouldnt mix up the two but in this way they are similar in that they reflect what it is that people value if you have a family and their budget you can look at their budget they spend a lot of money on entertainment you can pretty much figure they value that if they put a lot of money into food you can figure they definitely think that is a priority for them you can go through the family budget and see what people spend their money on see what people dont have in their budget and then you can pretty much figure well maybe thats not a priority for them of course they may not be able to afford it at this time but if you talk about reasonably middle class people their budget reflects what they care about what matters and what doesnt and for our nation that certainly is true if our nation puts more money into warfare than it does into social uplift jobs and the economy and infrastructure that says something about who we are if our national budget puts more money into infrastructure and jobs and putting people back to work then that says something about who we are the various budgets that have come up reflect what the various caucuses think is important and project a vision for our country i want to talk about that today i want to start by talking about paul ryans budget paul ryan is the republican budget committee chair hes a nice guy i dont have anything bad to say about him personally because he is actually a nice person but the fact is we disagree in a significant way about what the priorities of america should be for example the republican budget 20 children will lose access to head start to pay for one millionaires tax cut thats their budget just if you want to understand what their tax cuts represent it means 20 kids dont get to go to head start so that a millionaire can get a tax cut150 000 equals 20 times 7 500 so if you look at this tax cut a millionaires tax cut which will amount to about 150 000 these little guys dont get to go to head start now what is head start head start is a great program for lowincome kids to make sure that they have a chance at getting a quality education and dont fall behind in school and so this is a great program it has great results these head start kids 20 of them going to head start versus what a millionaires tax cut would be which is 150 000 now this is the choice were making we should not act like were not making choices we are making choices we are deciding my friends on the republican side of the aisle like to say oh we shouldnt pick winners and losers were always doing it they just pick the rich people and weipick the kids in head start also if you just want to get a sense of what the republican budget what it does and what the tax cuts that its calling for mean republican budget 150 college students will have their pell grants cut by 1 000 to pay for one millionaires tax cut so one millionaires tax cut 150 000 but 150 times 1 000 all these kids these college kids trying to make something of themselves their pell grant is going to get whacked by 1 000 bucks so again choices do we want to make sure the country club set is doing even better or do we want to make sure that these aspiring engineers these aspiring doctors and teachers these aspiring police officers these aspiring workers of tomorrow will have a shot at an affordable college education this is what were talking about these are the choices that were making and i think its very important that americans know it its critical that we know it now lets just not stop there lets talk about other critical choices being made because i think it is so critical that as were talking budget week and all the budget decisions that we are making that we make it real clear to the american people what it is were choosing republican budget 216 pregnant or postpartum women infants and children would lose access to wicthats the women infants and children program and it provides food for poor women and their kidsto pay for one millionaires tax cut so 150 000 tax cut for a millionaireagain this is the country club setequals about 216 pregnant women or postpartum women and the amount of money that americans give them so that they can have good nutrition for their kids these are poor women these are women who are struggling economically but just because theyre struggling economically we dont want their kids to go without good nutritious food so as americans we have the wic program well theyre going to get slashed out of the program because a millionaire needs a tax cut thats the choice that were making i want to talk about why were making that choice in a minute but i want to give one more example republican budget 25 seniors paying 6 000 or more for medicare to pay for one millionaires tax cut so if youre a millionaire and you get a tax cut under what the republicans want to give youyoure already doing good but they want you to even do betterthat will mean that youve got about 25 seniors who have to pay 6 000 a piece more for their medicare so mom dadif youre my age mom and dad are senior citizens if youre younger theyre not but if your parents or grandparents are on medicare and theyre doing all they can on their fixed income to make it theyre going to need a little extra help because weve got to make sure that that millionaire gets his 150 000 tax cut these are the choices that were making now my friends in the republican caucusgod bless themits not like they dont like poor people many of them are very charitable they give in their different walks of life maybe their faith community or whatever they just dont think government should do it this is what they say they think that government needs to get out of that and let churches mosques synagogues and other folks do it of course that would mean that it wouldnt get done because even though churches mosques and synagogues do great work they can never possibly come up to meet the need thats out there what theyre really believing isthis is what they really believe they believe in something called trickledown economics they believe that if you give this millionaire 150 000 more dollars than he already has he will maybe hopefully perhaps invest it in plant and equipment and maybe somebody will get a job because of it or maybe not or maybe he will invest in china hell improve jobs but just not in america nobody knows what they will do with this tax cut but this is what the republicans believe they think that if you give rich people more money they will invest in plant and equipment create more economic activity and it will trickle down to the rest of us the only problem is that it has never worked it doesnt stop them from saying it but its never worked in fact the gop budget will destroy more than 4 million american jobs in the next 2 years according to the economic policy institute the economic policy institute estimates that the shock to aggregate demand from nearterm spending cuts would result in roughly 1 3 million jobs lost in 2013 and 2 8 million jobs lost in 2014 or 4 1 million jobs through so a little bit more than 4 million jobs over the next 2 years now people might think well keith is that right well yeah its right and ill tell you why its right its right because when republicans say we need to cut government waste we need to cut government cut government cut government they act as if theres just some big government thing over there like its a big giant piece of styrofoam and they can just cut it and it doesnt change anything what theyre talking about cutting are federal workers theyre talking about laying off federal workers and theyre very derisive about government jobs and act like people who work for the government dont do anything of valueof course this is not true at all but if you look on this chart right here it says i earn less than 45 000 a year explain to me gop how cutting my pay creates jobs this particular person is named paul and he is an army depot worker i think we need army depot workers teresa is a nurseand this is her right here she lives in my district and she says twelve percent of the salary i earn caring for veterans goes to my retirement explain to me gop how cutting my retirement puts people to work well one of the things that they do in the ryan budget is cut into federal workers retirement they act like oh the government no the government is people the government is nurses the government is army depot workers and what about federal prisons that keep dangerous criminals behind bars i pay more than 9 000 a year for my familys health insurance explain to me gop how cutting my takehome pay lowers unemployment this guy is a corrections officer and thank goodness for correction officers or the streets that we live on wouldnt be so nice the bottom line is when republicans say oh were going to shrink the size of government what they mean is theyre going to lay off and cut the pay and cut the employment benefits of federal workers people who work in prisons at risk to themselves nurses who care for our veterans people who are army depot workers and people who work in our parks and people who fix our roads and a whole lot of other people heres a chart for you if you look at the ryan budget if you look at the gop proposal if you look at it and it could do what they want it to do it could cause a loss of up to 7 million jobs by 2016 because it would cut federal workers and then they wouldnt be able to have the money to spend in the neighborhoods they live in anymore that would then have a ripple effect in their neighborhoods because theyre buying less for example if that young nurse at the va in minnesota if she doesnt have the same pay as she had before then she cant buy as much as she bought before then the company she shops at doesnt sell her as much as they have before you do that enough multiply it times enough people and that company then needs to start laying off people so its a ripple effect what the republicans are asking for but if you look at what they wantedand im talking about going all the way back to h r 1 which is their proposalyou would see repealing health care reform that would cut about 2 million the gop budget that would cut about 3 million cuts to the federal workforce that would cut about 285 000 the socalled jobs act that would cut a lot the fair tax that would cut and they would just cut on down the line what theyre basically proposing is by shrinking government and by doing all that stuff theyre getting rid of people now i just want to be on the record because your words do get twisted if there is a federal program that is not justifiable and its so poorly run that its of no value to anyone im okay with cutting it i just want to say that on the record on the house floor im all right with cutting programs that dont work but when youre talking about va nurses and youre talking about corrections workers in federal prisons we need these people they do good stuff and i believe that we should stand by them as they stand by us the gop budgetnow going back to the budget we addressed todaywill shift costs to seniors for the medicare guarantee according to the aarp and whats aarp thats the leading organization representing retired persons and the cbowhats the cbo that is the congressional budget office and for folks who like to watch cspan id just say you need to know what cbo is because this is very important congressional budget office theyre the nonpartisan group that says whats really going on with the numbers at the same time it is raising the seniors cost this gop budget gives those making more than a million a year an average tax cut of about 394 000 so i put 150 up there a moment ago that was the generic millionaire the actual number is about 394 for the average millionaire per year on the average tax cut and also the tax breaks for big oil companies you know they get about 4 billion a year im talking about if you look at conoco exxonmobil and all the big oil companies they get about 4 billion a year now how much did you pay for gasoline im not saying that theyre not good people im not saying that they dont run a good business and supply an important product im just asking you this does exxonmobil really need your money through a tax subsidy do they i think that they dont need your money i think their 4 a gallon is taking care of them just fine and i think its outrageous that the republican budget that we dealt with does not eliminate that tax break in short the big oil companies who are gouging americans at the pump and the wealthiest americans win while middle class and working class families get the short end of the stick last year oil profitsand this is an exact number or close to it last year big oil profits totaled about 137 billion but you dont need to remember 137 billion all you need to remember is big oil profits were the biggest ever that the oil industry ever had and yet were forking it over to them through our tax money not through the pumps some people might think well of course were paying them keith through the pump they give us gas weve got to get to work so we need to buy the gas im not talking about that im saying they getthey can apply for grants and subsidies and it all adds up to about 4 billion a year with soaring gasoline prices big oils 2012 profits will even be bigger yet republicans want to give big oil more money in our tax dollars and it just doesnt make any sense now of course you shouldnt expect the big oil companies like exxonmobil to say we dont want the money of course they want the money who doesnt want money everybody does including them but the people who have a public responsibility to look out for the american people should be willing to say no to public subsidies for the exxonmobils of this world and again if you work for exxonmobil im not running you down im just saying that youre doing well enough and you dont need the help of the american people you can do fine on your own now those kids on head start need help they need help those college kids need help but not exxonmobil executives the major consequence for medicare and medicaid the ryan budget the republican budget has big consequences for medicaid and medicare many seniors will be forced to pay sharply higher premiums to stay in traditional medicare and keep their current choice of doctors new medicare beneficiaries would pay more than 1 200 more by 2030 and more than 6 000 by 2050 before more seniors would gradually shift to private health insurance plans over time increasing privatization of medicare more than 47 million americans would lose health care insurance over 10 years because they would get rid of obamacare now my friends in the republican aisle when they say obamacare they dont mean it in a nice way its an insult but you know what obama does care so i dont mind them saying obamacare i hope they keep saying it because theyre just reminding americans that obama cares about them and that the people the republicans want to look out for apparently do not states under the republican plan would be forced to slash medicaid eligibility benefits and payments to health care providers their budget shreds the medicaid safety net and shifts health care costs to states and beneficiaries blocking medicaid this shifts all risks including future recessions health care cost increases and disasters to states and beneficiaries so heres the thing this ryan budget this republican ryan budget it helps and takes care of the rich it ignores everyone else and it hurts the middle class the republican budget would weaken the middle class in important ways first and foremost their plan ends the medicare guarantee of decent health insurance in retirement it also slashes critical middle class investments such as education and infrastructure by 45 percent and 24 percent respectivelyeducation by 45 percent infrastructure by 24 percent now look the american society of civil engineers has told us that we have crumbling infrastructure in this country to the tune of about 2 2 to 3 trillion a lot of money and if you are living in any city across this country you can drive over 75yearold bridges you can drive over potholes our sewage systems need upgrade i am from minneapolis minnesota a city i love so much but back a few years ago we had a bridge fall into the mississippi river because the gusset plates which are those plates that hold up the bridge gave way because the adequate maintenance just wasnt maintained over time now it happened to us but it could happen anywhere there are many structurally deficient bridges across this nation literally thousands we could put people back to work if we put the money into taking care of them and not only would we have people working wed have to save bridges to go over but the republican majority to use their phrase kicks the can down the road and doesnt deal with this looming infrastructure crisis so let me just say this ive talked a little bit about the socalled ryan republican budget i dont want to spend all my time talking about it but i do think its important for americans to know that this is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for people whove got it well who are doing fine now let me just tell you i swear i am a big fan of welltodo people i wish i were one of them but my point is that you dont need to help people who already have a lot of help on their own but you do need to help schoolkids head start kids pregnant moms pregnant lowincome moms seniors these people we should help people who are doing fine they dont need our help they should do the helping in my opinion and yet the ryan budget says were just going to help the country club set and i think thats not any way to have a budget im going to talk about the progressive caucus budget but i just want you to know first that the ryan republican budget is no good budget for america in fact its premised on the theory that rich people dont have enough money and poor people have too much really thats the animating organizing feature of their budget that if we gave rich people more money then they might invest it in plant and equipment and then itll trickle down to the rest of us and poor people have too much stuff we cant afford it we cant afford head start cant afford wic cant afford home heating oil for seniors cant afford medicare cant afford medicaid the poor folks are just theyre getting treated too well and thats basically what the theory is of the republican budget and so thats fine and i respect them for being real honest about what they believe in because a budget is a reflection of our values so now that weve talked about what theyre talking about lets talk about a real budget not for the 1 percent but a budget for all the progressive caucus budget has a name the name of the progressive caucus budget is the budget for all thats the name of the progressive caucus budget because unlike the republicans budget which is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for all let me tell you what it does it creates 3 3 million jobs in the first 2 years it cuts the deficit by nearly 7 trillion 6 8 trillion no benefit cuts to medicare medicaid and social security the budget for all makes the american dream a reality again for the vast majority of americans by putting americans back to work the budget for all enhances our economic competitiveness by rebuilding the middle class and investing in innovation and education our budget protects medicare and medicaid social security invests in americas future and asks those who have benefited the most from our economy to pay their fair share now as i said you cant have a budgetyou can have a budget that cuts taxes for rich people if you then cut services for poor people and you can have a budget that pays for infrastructure and education but the money has to come from somewhere and we ask people who already have lots of it to do a little more for their fellow americans were not hiding that fact yes we would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans not to punish them because we dont think taxes are punishment but because its necessary to meet the needs of the nation and any selfrespecting patriot would do so if they could in fact there is a group out thereand i would urge you to check them out mr speakercalled patriotic millionaires who understand that they may need to pay higher taxes if you already are making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that lowincome pregnant women got some food for their kids if you are already making a million or more a year would you pay a little extra to make sure that little kids had head start to go to if youre already making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that the federal workers dont have their pensions cut to pay for your tax cut thats just my thinking i dont want anybody to think the republicans are mean they do charitable work in their individual lives and thats a fact and i think people ought to know that but they dont think government has any role in helping people i disagree with that and call on americans to look carefully at the choices that they offer the budget for all is not a budget for the 1 percent its not a budget for the 99 percent but a budget for all because we care about the 1 percent too we want even the 1 percent to live in a good nation with fairness with economic opportunity with economic mobility with good roads good bridges good education clean water clean air we want this for everyone the budget for all attacks americas persistently high unemployment levels with more than 2 4 trillion over 10 years in jobcreating investment this plan utilizes every tool at the governments disposal to get our economy moving again including directhire programs that create school improvement corps park improvement corps student jobs corps and others targeted tax incentives that spur clean energy manufacturing cuttingedge technological investment in the private sector widespread domestic investment including an infrastructure bank a 556 billion surface transportation unlike this thing that they tried to pass today which is a 3month extension by the way can you believe it the republican caucus is always going on and on about uncertainty what did they do they created uncertainty by passing some 3month transportation bill my goodness it boggles the mind actually back to the budget for all there is approximately 1 7 trillion in widespread domestic investment unlike the republican budget the budget for all substantially reduces the deficit and does so in a way that does not devastate what americans value we achieve these notable benchmarks by focusing on the true drivers of our deficit unsustainable tax policy wars overseas and the policies that helped cause the recent recession rather than putting the middle class and the social safety net on the chopping block the budget creates a fairer america it ends tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans on schedule at the years end extends tax relief for middle class households and the vast majority of americans creates new tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires in line with the buffett rule principle eliminates tax code preferential treatment for capital gains and dividends abolishes corporate welfare for oil gas and coal companies eliminates loopholes that allow businesses to dodge their true tax liability creates a publicly funded federal election system that gets corporate money out of politics for good it responsibly and expeditiously ends our military presence in afghanistan leaving america more secure at home and abroad it also adapts our military to address 21st century threats through modernization the department of defense will spend less and stop contributing to the deficit but they will have what they need to keep america strong which is very important to all of us it provides a makingworkpay tax credit for families struggling with high gas and food costs extends an earned income tax credit and child dependent care credit invests in programs to stave off further foreclosure invests in childrens education by increasing education training and social services the budget for all is a budget for all i know that sounds repetitive but its important to note that the name of our budget reflects the reality of our budget and the reality of our budget is that we want to see rich poor and everybody in the middle do well in america that means a budget for all as i begin to wind down i just want to say that it is an honor to come before you to talk about the budget for all but its also an honor to talk about the ryan republican budget because the ryan republican budget offers a very different vision of america than the budget for all the ryan vision says that if we just could get rich people more money they might create some plants and equipment that will hire the rest of us the budget for all says no were in this together and were going to ask the wealthiest to pay more to invest in health education transportation and infrastructure so that we can have a stronger better greater america two visions of a nation one says austerity for the middle and working class and the poor and one says investment one says if you

reduce the deficit the best way to do that is job creation we know that if we want to talk about what happened in the nineties we have to reference the fact that under president bill clinton the reaganbush deficit that he inherited he turned around and five of his last budgets the clinton budgets were in balance or were in surplus he put us on a trajectory he and the growth of jobs in our country in the public and largely in the private sector took us to a path a trajectory of 5 6 trillion in surplus along comes president george w bush and in record time he reversed that it was the biggest fiscal turnaround in our nations history taking us to a trajectory of over 5 trillion in deficit an 11 trillion turnaround two unpaidfor wars said the cbo the nonpartisan congressional budget office that was because of two unpaidfor wars the bush tax cuts particularly at the high end which did not create jobs and a giveaway pharmaceutical bill to the pharmaceutical industry those were the three main reasons for the big fiscal turnaround and how we got deeply in debt i dont remember a lot of complaints coming from the republican side of the aisle while president bush was taking us down this path mr goodlatte referenced two paths well this is one path that president bush took us down so now we have to deal with that because the deficit is a concern to all of us we believe that the best way to deal with that is what president clinton did which was to have a great economic agenda to generate jobs yet here we are nearly 320 days into the republican majority and they have taken no action on any serious jobcreating bills here we go again debating legislation that will not create jobs in fact according to experts the enactment of this proposed amendment to our constitution would destroy 15 million jobs double the unemployment rate and cause the economy to shrink by 17 percent as bruce bartlett said recently former economic adviser to president ronald reagan and to president george herbert walker bush even if we were not in an economic crisis and fighting two wars a rapid cut in spending of that magnitude would unquestionably throw the economy into recession just as it did in 1937 this legislation is an attack on our economy and it is an attack on our seniors according to the nonpartisan center on budget and policy priorities it could result in cuts over 10 years of 750 billion to medicare and 1 2 trillion in cuts to social security these cuts would be devastating to the 40 million seniors who rely on medicare and social security every day they are even more draconian than the cuts in the republican budget which would effectively repeal the medicare guarantee and just one week after our nation celebrated veterans day we are debating potentially cutting 85 billion over the next 10 years from veterans benefits my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim this is a clean balanced budget amendment it is not because this proposed amendment to our constitution will require a supermajority in both chambers of congress to raise the debt limit it puts the full faith and credit of the united states of america in the hands of a minoritythis after we went through all of the stress and strain and uncertainty and downgrading of our credit rating when we couldnt even get a majority and now were thinking of a supermajority vote for the debt limit increase again that was never a requirement when president bush was president that there would be a supermajority to raise the debt limit this amendment promotes further brinkmanship and uncertainty enshrining extreme ideology into the constitution at a time when americans have been very clear that they expect us to set differences aside and to get to work it is our duty as members of congressindeed we take the oath of officeto be the elected guardians of our constitution to protect and defend it and to do no harm to our founding documents yet if this proposed amendment is adopted it will have farreaching and adverse consequences i repeat that it was a democratic president president clinton who balanced the budget in the nineties five of his budgets were in balance or in surplus we can do it again without harming our constitution our economy our seniors or our veterans we must start by creating jobs and strengthening our economic growtha key to reducing the deficit it was interesting to me to hear others on the other side of the aisle talk about our children and our responsibility to them yes thats what we said when president bush was amassing his deficit but i didnt hear anyone on the other side of the aisle talking about that this is about our constitution we owe it to the vision of our founders to the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and to the aspirations of our children to get our economic and fiscal houses in order this is the exact wrong way to do it we must reignite the american dream and we have work to do on that so lets get to work to create jobs so that many more people can achieve the american dream i urge my colleagues to vote no"], [0.9951509237289429, 0.9951509237289429, 0, "says that his children are old enough that they should be able to take care of themselves even though they are under 26 years old bravo for you but thats not the way it is for many young people across the country even if they do have a job you say they dont have insurance because they dont have a job it may be news to you but there are many many many working americans who do not have health insurance but they will under the affordable care act if this amendment were to pass if it were to become law immediately all of those children who can now be on their parents policy if their parents are willing would lose their health insurance with a job or without a job these young people coming out of school are idealistic and ambitious they want to follow their passions and their pursuits that is what our founders told them they could dolife liberty and pursuit of happiness these young people want a healthier life to pursue their happiness to choose a job not based on the health benefits it may or may not provide but to choose an occupation which addresses their aspirationsnot ours theirs so i just want to repeat back to our colleagues something i heard them say over and over again they said we didnt read the bill well we did but clearly you did not and i urge you to read the bill because if you did you would see that the bill puts medical decisions in the hands of patients and doctors not your favorite insurance company you would see that it brings down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors you would see that it ends the days of discrimination based on preexisting conditions and lifetime caps on the care of children and families you would see that under this bill no longer would being a woman be a preexisting medical condition as it is now as women are discriminated against in terms of price and access to insurance you would see that it offers tax credits to millions of small businesses who choose to do right by their employees and offer insurance benefits it was for all of these americans that we acted it is for them that we stand here today to oppose this amendment and if you read the bill you will see contrarycontrary to misrepresentations that were set forth by those who do the bidding of the health insurance industry in our country you would see what the bill does you would see that it is about innovation its about prevention its about a healthier america not just health care in america its about using the technologies of the future its about bringing health care closer to people where they live to lower the cost to improve the quality and to expand the access you would see that it is a bill about the future instead of the misrepresentations about this that and the other thing which i dont even want to repeat here you would see that this is transformative for our country because it gives people the liberty again to pursue their lives so i would like to know how many of you read the bill we read it over and over again to each other drilling down on different parts of it so we know of what we speak when we come to this floor and maybe if you knew more about it you wouldnt be so quick to saywe do not want to allow children to stay on their parents policies we do not want to end discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions for our children we do not want to begin to close the doughnut hole we do not want to have preventive medicines without cost and copay for our seniors and the list goes on and on so thats whats happening here today this is again yet again another example of our friends standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the american people standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the health and wellbeing of our country it is again an example of washington d c holding on to the special interest status quo it is again this congress saying to the american people we are here for the special interest we are not here for the peoples interest to stacie we are not here for your two daughters for vernal we are not here for women and having being a woman being a preexisting condition to claudette and richard to say to them too bad about your mortgage if you cant pay your mortgage because you have to pay your medical bills so be it i urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment which is another manifestation of the so be it attitude of some in congress at the expense of many in our country"],

fishery catch shares may not be the best option for every fishery but that decision should be left to the industry the management experts and the scientists in their region where the fishery occurs in

opposition to this bill the republicans are saying that there is a war on coal but the only battle coal is losing is in the free marketto natural gas to wind and to solar just 4 years ago coal generated 51 percent of the electricity in the united states now it is down to 35 percent when you add up hydropower the renewables natural gas and the other gases you get 44 percent of our electricity sector just like governor romney says he has given up on 47 percent of americans the house republicans have given up on 44 percent of our electricity sector just like their politics grips tightly to the past their energy policies hold fast to the energy technologies and the fuels of yesterday like coal and oil the free market has been replacing coal with natural gas which has grown from 21 percent of our electricity generation back in 2005 and 2006 and has now risen to 30 percent of all electrical generation in the united states natural gas its not a war its a revolution what has happened is simultaneously coal has come down to 35 percent surprising isnt it the numbers look like they match up pretty perfectly especially if you add up the rise from 1 percent to 4 percent of the electricity in the united states which has been generated by wind over the last 5 years thats whats happening ladies and gentlemen all the rest of this i dont understand to be honest with you its almost like the republicans are rejecting the free market as it is now operating as the country is moving to natural gas i understand the coal state members have to stand up and defend this change in the marketplace but i dont understand why my other republican friends would reject those free market principles why is this switch from coal to natural gas happening its because natural gas is cheaper natural gas prices have decreased by 66 percent since 2008 it is cheaper to produce new electricity from natural gas than from coal this isnt a conspiracyit is a competitionbut republicans say that there is a war on coal well in a market sense that war is now being won when i was a boy i had to go down into the basement with my father to shovel the coal thats how we kept our house warm then my mother said lets move to home heating oil and so my father had the home heating oil come that was a revolution and now there is another revolution going on up in the northeast for example because of the low price of natural gas 1 4 million northeast households have switched from oil to natural gas over the last decade and why is that again it costs 2 238 to heat your home through the winter with home heating oil and it costs 629 to heat your home with natural gas thats why theyre switching the same thing is happening in the petrochemical industry theyre switching from oil over to natural gas in the fertilizer industry theyre switching from oil over to natural gas the price is low they are moving in that direction thats the larger story that is occurringthe natural gas revolution in the united states of america so ladies and gentlemen i just urge all of you to understand that this is not the obama administration in a war against coal that is not what is going on there is a paranoiainducing darwinian marketplace revolution that is taking placeled by natural gas followed by windthat is changing the makeup of the electricity marketplace in our country only when you

hasnt moved fast its only been in effect 6 months its already been able to organize the grocers into unions and other big industries into unions its the strongest labor plan ever adopted in the history of the united states trade agreements and thats not my opinion thats the opinion of the secretary of labor of this country its the opinion of the congressional research office and frankly a

trade agreement which we passed it has that right here under article 17 and this is the colombian free trade agreement they are exactly the same the principles are the same number 2 reads effective recognition of the right to collective bargainingeffective recognition that means that anything that stops that can be brought under this agreement an action against the country so look youll hear
