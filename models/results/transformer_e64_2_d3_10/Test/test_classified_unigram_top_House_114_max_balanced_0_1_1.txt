course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes our country stronger so thank you congresswoman kelly and thank you congressman payne for the chance to be with you tonight"], [0.0016755461692810059, 0.998324453830719, 1, "first let me thank congresswoman robin kelly and congressman donald payne jr for hosting this important special order i appreciate your leadership in organizing this important discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i urge my colleagues to join us in securing health equity for all"], [0.0018280744552612305, 0.9981719255447388, 1, "i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this special order and for your continued leadership on so many vital issues and for staying the course and holding down the fort for the congressional black caucus it is so important that our message of unity and our messagewhich really describes what many of the issues are that all of our communities are faced withthat that message goes out both of you have really been tremendous in this effort so i rise this evening to join this critical conversation on race relations in america and to challenge our colleagues to work with the congressional black caucus to realize progress for racial justice and equality i join congresswoman kelly and congressman payne in sending my condolences to the families and the victims of the horrific terrorist attacks in paris lebanon nigeria and also in egypt know that we join in this quest for global peace and security throughout the world now tonights special order is an important part of our work to address the discrimination and racism that still plagues our nation specifically as it relates to african americans but we know that it impacts all communities of color it is manifested in many ways and it affects our entire country as congressman payne said so eloquently we are the united states so when one is affected all are affected all across the country at universities like mizzou and yale in places like baltimore and ferguson and in high schools like spring valley high in columbia south carolina we are witnessing the painful impact of institutional racism in our communities very recently we saw this in my home district at berkley high school in one of the most progressive and enlightened cities in the country black students were subjected to threatening messages on campus but i am so proud of the students at berkley they walked offit was not only black students it was all studentsand marched out peacefully through the city to protest these terrible despicable messages this is unacceptable all students have a right to learn free from violence and from threats as long as black students and any student of color feels unsafe in their classrooms our work for justice remains incomplete this crisis isnt limited to our schools tragically people of color face institutional racism from the moment they are born according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee and the congressional black caucus more than one in three black children are born into poverty this cycle of poverty and inequality continues in our school system where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions mind you now that is preschool that is students from about 2 years old to 4 years old black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment i cant figure out how any student aged 2 to 4 is expelled from school that is outrageous yet 42 percent of preschool student expulsions are african american babies these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start outside of the classroom african americans are overpoliced overcriminalized and underemployed a report published by the new york times in april found that there are an estimated 1 5 million black men between the ages of 24 to 54 who are missing from civic life just missing it these missing men who account for one in every six black men have been victims of mass incarceration or premature death and this crisis of inequality extends to the structures of the community and have persisted from generations over the past four decades the average unemployment rate for blacks has been double the rate for white americans for many black families it feels like this is a permanent recession this must be our call to action that is why i am so proud of our young people throughout the country and students who are standing up to racism and injustice in their communities it is time for congress to listen to the young people saying that black lives matter and black students matter earlier this month i held a forum on racial justice in my district to address these issues more than 300 east bay residents from all backgrounds attended and raised their voices for justice this was the second forum that i have held throughout the last 3 months now i have been able to reach over 1 000 east bay residents so tonight in this dialogue which congressman payne and congresswoman kelly have talked about this dialogue leads to action hopefully our colleagues would think about hosting these types of forums and listen to what people are saying listen to what the impact of some of our policies are on their daily lives we must be part of the conversation and the solution but we must listen we must hear the pain and the suffering that people are experiencing as a result of discrimination and racial injustice now the congress must act to start addressing the systemic racism that degrades our institutions and threatens our communities it is past time for us to get serious about us addressing the lack of opportunity for black and minority families in this country right now today in this chamber there is legislation that can start moving the needle forward we need to empower our communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color and we need to address chronic recidivism which would be a huge step toward returning some of our missing men to their families and communities to do this congress should pass the safe justice act sponsored by congressman sensenbrenner and congressman scott congress should also pass the stop militarizing law enforcement act h r 1232 to stop the militarization of our nations police forces we also should pass the police accountability act h r 1102 and the grand jury reform act h r 429 so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and that there is more accountability for police officers as we reform our broken criminal justice system and work to help repair those families hurt by mass incarceration we will be strengthening america we will have people who really can make a contribution not only to their families and their communities but to the entire country the federal government shouldnt continue to put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and should ban the box totally by federal contractors and by federal agencies we also need to repeal the lifetime ban on pell grants for those formerly incarcerated as it relates to drug felonies the ineligibility for public assistance and food stamps we need to remove these barriers so that people of color primarily african american men and latino men can get back into society get a job and take care of their families once again this is an example of public policy that racism wreaks its ugly head in our own institutions and policies finally we must address the poverty that plagues communities of color all across the country we have the whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity which i am proud to chair with our whip mr hoyer we are working with more than 100 of our colleagues now to advance policies that give all families including african american families living below the poverty line both in urban communities and in rural communities a fair shot this effort includes our half in ten act h r 258 which calls for a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade that is more than 22 million americans lifted out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our existing programs our pathway out of poverty act h r 2721 would create goodpaying jobs it would lift families out of poverty into the middle class while strengthening our safety net for those who are still struggling ultimately the only way to end institutional racism is to give african americans and people of color a seat at the table and we need to pass legislation and policies that begin to remove these barriers my mentor the honorable congresswoman shirley chisholm used to say if they dont give you a seat at the table bring in a folding chair that is what our young people are doing around the country so i want to thank all of the people across our country who are bringing in folding chairs and ensuring that these important conversations happen we hear you we support you and we will keep fighting for you for ensuring liberty and justice for all which means just that it means for all in doing so we will make the united states a stronger country i thank congresswoman kelly and congressman payne for organizing this very important special order i know that out of this discussion we are laying out what can be done and it doesnt take

representatives to beg the majority party just to debate and vote on commonsense gun legislation that the vast majority of americans demand we should not be living in a society where debate and even

standing up for the millions of americans who want congress to do something and honoring the thousands of americans who have lost their lives to gun violence here we are standing up for our constituents who are tired of the excuses and want to hear a debate and want to see us take action on gun violence and here we are today to represent the victims the list is so long orlando san bernardino newton fort hood charleston the list goes on nine in a church 23 in a restaurant 26 in an elementary school and now 49 in a nightclub the victims are men and women black and white rich and poor old and young at a mcdonalds in california an 8monthold baby was killed along with his mother who was trying to shelter him when a gunman came in and started shooting at a north carolina nursing home a 98yearold grandmother was killed when a shooter came in and opened fire here in the united states you are 10 times more likely to be killed by a gun than in any other developed nation in the

are 50 times more likely to die of a gun death than in all of those other countries we have the most guns and we have the most gun violence we have the nra through fear intimidation and misinformation the nra has taken control over the debate on guns to such an extent that we cannot even vote in this chamber on whether we should keep guns out of the hands of terrorists right now someone can be on both the terrorist watch list and the nofly list in other words the fbi thinks you are a terrorist and the tsa bans you from flying but if you want to drive down to your local gun store and buy an assault rifle there is nothing anyone can do to stop you over the last 10 years people on the terrorist watch list tried to buy explosives or firearms 2 233 times over 90 percent of the time they were successful this is wrong the american people know it is wrong public health officials know it is wrong and nearly every single law enforcement association in america knows it is wrong which is why they are all in favor of closing the terrorist gun loophole in fact a recent poll by a republican pollster found 76 percent of gun owners and 71 percent of nra members said suspected terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns if you were to walk outside the house of representatives right now and stop someone walking down the street and ask the simple question should terrorists be allowed to buy guns you would get a very simple answer they would say no of course terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns but they can republicans here in the house wont even let us have a debate and a vote on it how did we get here mr speaker how has the debate shifted so far away from commonsense gun regulation that a proposal to close the terrorist gun loophole is this controversial why is it that here in the house debate is silenced and we are not allowed to vote the closest we came to a debate on gun legislation recently came last week when a controversy erupted about the standard procedure to observe a moment of silence on the house floor after a mass shooting it is shameful that we have allowed this country to get to a point where congress has to even have a standard procedure to observe

hitting my mind all the time because its not fair it makes me cry tyshawn lee was a 9yearold boy in chicago deliberately assassinated shot multiple times in the head kaline continues i hope people can make better decisions about what to do with guns i hope people stop fighting about whether we should do gun control because i worry more people and kids like tyshawn will be killed we cant accept

no meaningful action we take action all the time to protect our kids from threats to their safety we have regulations in place on teddy bears and pacifiers to protect childrens health and safety but

stop every death but we should start by passing commonsense gun legislation supported by the vast majority of the american people we need a vote on legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands

justice to these families their work is essential to ensuring the people of flint have the resources that they need to recover the situation in flint is nothing short of a tragedy and a tragedy that could have been prevented michigan state officials sacrificed the health and futures of flints children in order to save a few dollars in water costs this really is a shame and a disgrace i have to ask would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where politicians believe the residents are expendable sadly i think we all know the answer to that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals it is clear

percent of children are living below the poverty level and in chicago most of the south and west sides have 40 to 60 percent of residents living below the poverty level if we are serious about making

presidents action this congress needs to make it a priority to make adequate investments in early childhood education and other programs aimed at lifting children out of poverty additionally making meaningful reforms to our criminal justice system and increasing resources to reduce the flow of drugs and illegal guns through our ports will help fight back the firearm black market this is not about the second amendment an overwhelming number of americansmost gun owners themselvesagree that we must do something to stop guns from getting into the hands of people who shouldnt have them this

butterfield of the congressional black caucus i as well am overwhelmed with the pain that we have seen not only in baltimore which we have seen most recently but in cities like ferguson in north charleston in new york where we have seen the convergence of poverty and the need for criminal justice reform converge i too want to offer my sympathy to the family of freddie gray we have watched them over the past couple of days in the midst of their mourning to be able to stand up and call for peace nonviolence nonviolent protests they should be honored and to those in baltimore and particularly my colleague from marylandi will call him congressman cummings with the bullhorn politics the bullhorn leadershiphe should be commended for the stunning and outstanding engagement that he touched the hearts and minds of his constituents walked those streets to be able to acknowledge the pain the poverty but that there is a better way that there is a way toward the stars that we all want our children to have and yes to ms graham who wanted better for her son michael i want him not to be embarrassed but to be proud that he had a mother with such deep love that she wanted to take him away from doing it wronglynot against protests not against the quiet marching of the spirit of dr king but to know that engaging in violence is intolerable and will not allow him to reach the very high heights that he can reach today i stand here to acknowledge the convergence of the need for criminal justice reform and the deep and abiding poverty in the african american community one in every six americans is living in poverty totaling 46 2 million people this is the highest number in 17 years children represent a disproportionate amount of the united states poor population it falls heavily on the african american community in my district there are 190 000plus living in poverty it falls heavily on the african american community this is not a standing invitation for the door to open and say lets blame president obama president obama has been a stellar leader on the questions of realizing the investment in people from the stimulus that brought us out of the depths of collapse of the markets and a complete imploding of the capitalistic system he provided the stimulus that moved us toward an economy where we were creating jobs but here we have in congress this dastardly sequester that is cutting head start seats not investing in infrastructure not creating jobs or providing opportunities for our young people so today i say that there needs to be a call for action that call for action is that this congress must get rid of sequester and must look at the baltimores and must look at the fergusons and houstons and l a s and new yorks and cities across america and realize that we are coming upon a summertime and if we dont act to invest in our children and to begin to give an agenda to release ourselves from poverty we will have doomed ourselves and i would offer to say that the inertia of moving toward criminal justice reform in this congress is unacceptable i call upon members to come together collectively to be able to pass legislation the cadet bill that i have introduced the build trust bill but more importantly i am calling upon our government to invest in our youth to get rid of the poverty to prepare them as they go into higher education as they go into upper grades we must have a program of summer jobs this summer and we must have a collaborative effort with corporate america wake up corporate america wake up corporate baltimore wake up corporate new york wake up corporate houston there must be an investment in summer jobs collaborating with the federal government to make a difference to lift families out of poverty we do know that summer jobs with young people elevate families ability to pay their bills and to provide resources for their families so if the story of baltimore is any it is one dont jump to conclusions dont jump to conclusions that freddie gray tried to hurt himself dont jump to conclusions that these young people dont mean well dont jump to conclusions that they shouldnt have done what they have done jump to the conclusions that these are young people who are hungry and looking for leadership and are in pain as congressman cummings said look for the opportunity for them help rebuild baltimore help give them jobs help tell them that the improved relationships between police and community are going to be moved forward as a number one agenda for the united states congress and this government that they

college campus at an elementary school in a church in a nightclub or on the streets of our cities we have lost far too many innocent lives to gun violence let me give you some numbers 31 2 that is the number of years since the terrible tragedy at sandy hook elementary school 34 000 that is the number of people who have been killed by someone using a gun since sandy hook 1 182 that is the number of mass shootings in our country since sandy hook 30 that is the number of moments of silence observed by this house for victims of gun violence since sandy hook 521 that is the number of days the house has been in session since sandy hook and zerozerothat is the number of votes that have been taken in this house to keep guns out of dangerous hands in the last 31 2 years just a few weeks ago we experienced the worst mass shooting in our countrys history at the pulse nightclub in orlando fortynine innocent people lost their lives in that nightclub 49 people who were someones son daughter someones brother sister someones significant other someones friend and someones loved one after this horrific shooting the american people dont want to see their elected representatives fall back into the same old pattern of mass shootings followed by moments of silence thoughts and prayers but no real action taken to help prevent the next tragedy the american people want to see congress pass meaningful legislation to help keep our communities and our loved ones safe eightyfive percent of americans are in favor of banning individuals on the terrorist watch list from being able to legally buy guns ninety percent of americans support strengthening and expanding our background check system there are two bipartisan prosecond amendment bills that would do just that the first bill h r 1076 known as the no fly no buy was introduced by our republican colleague peter king this bill says that if you are on the fbis terrorist watch list then you dont get to walk into a gun store pass a background check and leave with the weapon of your choice if there is one thing both sides of the aisle should be able to agree on it is keeping guns away from suspected terrorists bring that bill up for a vote the second bill h r 1217with 186 coauthors democrats and republicanswould close a dangerous loophole in our background check system that allows criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill to bypass a background check altogether and instead purchase their guns online or at a gun show or through a classified ad this is a huge loophole and it costs lives you dont have to look any further than the sister of elvin daniel from wisconsin his sister zina had a restraining order against her husband which prevented him from passing a background check when he tried to buy a gun in a store nevertheless zinas husband was able to go online and buy the same gun a 40caliber semiautomatic handgun and he took that gun and used it to kill zina and two other people in a store in wisconsin this bill would close these kinds of loopholes and help stop criminals from getting guns everyone says they want to keep guns away from dangerous people but the only way to know if someone is dangerous is to conduct a background check background checks are our first line of defense against criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill in getting guns last year 260

gentlewoman as profoundly tragic as it is no one should have been surprised by the recent revelations that planned parenthood is harvesting and selling the body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america was meant to be and for those noble americans who died to make it come to be abraham lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation these are indeed days that will be considered in the annals of history and i believe in the councils of eternity itself this bloody shadow has loomed over america for too long it is time for the senate to pass the paincapable unborn child protection act because in spite of all the political noise protecting little paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue it is not a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here it is

for florida homeowners this is a winwin giving them more options for flood insurance coverage and using new competition to drive down prices and expand coverage options for consumers the national flood insurance program is an important tool that empowers and protects homeowners all across america the biggertwaters act of 2012 took an important step in opening up the market and allowing private flood insurance policies to satisfy mandatory coverage requirements under the program however as we have learned sometimes even the best laid plans can have unintended consequences with a lack of clarity as to which private flood insurance policies are allowed in the program the market has not been able to expand and consumers have been left with just one choice to insure their properties from flood risk the national flood insurance program i recently heard from one of my constituents in martin county florida about how the premium for just 1 year of flood insurance coverage through the nfip ended up being five times the price they expected it to be to make matters worse the maximum coverage was only half of what they paid for the home itself yet they were required to purchase the higher priced plan that did not provide the coverage they needed because there were no other options this highlights the urgent need to allow competition in the flood insurance marketplace to meet homeowners needs and drive down costs but to do that we must allow the states to license and regulate flood insurance policies exactly like homeowners insurance car insurance or health insurance yet almost inexplicably floridas private flood insurance market remains restrained because homeowners are not given the choice to look to private market policies for more flood insurance options the bank will not accept other policies because their regulators havent approved them this bill will solve this problem by allowing state insurance commissioners who have long been considered by congress as the most appropriate regulators of insurance to certify private insurance plans to provide equivalent or better protections for flood insurance other than the nfip plan everyone i talk to agrees that

system address existing flaws and better serve our veterans the problems that have plagued the system have been welldocumented both in congressional hearings and in the press since the year 2000 at least 22 government reports have looked into patient wait times at va facilities one of these reports found that more than 57 000 of our veterans have waited longer than 90 days for health care the audit found that staff were instructed to misrepresent data in 76 percent of va facilities the va is in need of immediate attention and reform and we are doing a disservice to our veterans by delaying
