thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country this legislative body and all of our lives much richer than we would otherwise have known without the opportunity and privilege of calling sala burton a very close and special friend"], [0.002194702625274658, 0.9978052973747253, 1, "we all know that the workers strike in gdansk poland is now over i salute them and their courageous behavior in the face of riot police hunger fear and the burdens placed on their loved ones the workers who walked out of the shipyards held their heads high and did not back down from their demands for the legalization of the solidarity labor unionthe only way in which the polish government can achieve anything resembling true economic reform in poland on the surface polish workers on strike at nowa huta gdansk and in other areas of the country were protesting huge price increases that would further impoverish them without changing the way in which the economy is ordered according to an article in yesterdays wall street journal polands gross national product stands at about its 1978 level while real per capita income is only 78 percent of what it was 10 years ago solidarity economists have reported that between 2533 percent of poles now live below the poverty line half of all polish workers die before reaching retirement age giving the country the highest mortality rate for workers in all of europe the wait for an apartment can take as long as 50 years health care is in a disgraceful stateneeded medicines cannot be obtained diagnostic equipment is obsolete or not available at all and the environment is in such sad shape that a new grassroots social organizationthe freedom and peace movementhas devoted itself almost exclusively to this vital issue and has seen its membership swell in recent years all of these problems point to the failure of the polish government to implement an economic reform package able to meet the needs of the polish people the workers rose up in protest not just because of price increases but because true economic reform cannot take place without real political reform as solidarity chairman lech walesa has said reform must be based on the citizens natural right to economic initiatives and interprises and this can only come about if the citizens of poland are given the right to form their own trade unions to join other organizations not dominated by the government and to work toward institutional guarantees which will ensure a pluralistic society what gave me a great deal of hope for the situation in poland was the youth of the workers that struck at gdansk most were too young to appreciate the events leading up to legalization of solidarity in 1980 and yet these were the very workers who were chanting no freedom without solidarity and often appeared to be more militant than their elders who had experienced labor unrest in the past on monday it was these young workers who refused to accept a compromise that was largely agreed to by the strike committee only when the prospect of a police attack looked imminent did these young men agree with their older leaders to leave the shipyard the reverend henryk jankowski pastor of the nearby st brygldas church called them wonderful young men who he could not allow to be beaten i want to conmend our president for speaking out and condemning the use of force against the workers it was statements like these which made the polish government think twice about doing at gdansk what was done at nowa huta i sincerely hope the president will continue to watch the situation closely in poland prominent solidarity activists like bodgan lis and wladislaw frasyniuk still remain in jail and the polish government may still take retribution against those who took part in the strike far from being a failure the strikes in poland represented in the words of chairman walesa a new spring for solidarity they reaffirm the demand for workers in a supposedly worker state to have a voice in the management of their factoriesto have a say in the vital matters which affect them i agree with walesa that nothing has ended and that nothing has been finished the end of the strike was certainly no victory for the government the reform policy of the government cannot possibly succeed without the consent of the people of polandand in large part this means the legalization of solidarity"], [0.0022217631340026855, 0.9977782368659973, 1, "i rise today in response to the unrelenting assault on amercas elderly and poor that assault is most clearly and most recently reflected in the administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding americas most vulnerable"], [0.0022794604301452637, 0.9977205395698547, 1, "on

property the 27squaremile rocky mountain arsenal irmaj was established in 1942 and was used by the army to manufacture and dispose of chemical weapons such as nerve gas the army also leased a section of the arsenal grounds to a private company to manufacture pesticides the arsenal which has been placed on superfunds national priority list is considered one of the most toxic parcels of land in the

chemical warfare agents and pesticides between 1957 and 1980 this basin which is surrounded by a tall fence contains chemicals considered so toxic that devices are in place to prevent birds from

did not mature the lands hired a veterinarian who conducted water and diet tests on the cattle and concluded the sickness was caused by poison in the water during the 1970s the army denied responsibility indicating that the contamination was not emanating from rma on october 6 1976 the army sent a letter regarding mr lands claims to the lands attorney samuel l mcclaren the army indicated that no pollution to the area occurred due to government activities the armys 1976 letter was sent several years after the colorado department of health outside the rma boundaries after the

succeeded by sonny callahan who then took his place on our show despite the fact that i am a democrat and the two other participants in this program are republicans i think that we have been able to discuss frankly the issues and at the same time present to the public a camaraderie that is complementary of the natinns lawmaking body yes there were times that we disagreed on certain aspects of proposed legislation or on major national issues but we always were able to go into depth on these matters without being unusually disagreeable trent always was tactful as well as eloquent in bringing forth the views of his party as well as his own one humorous incident about trent lott i will not forget in 1979 right after hurricane fredric had done considerable damage along the gulf coast trent jack edwards and i along with a couple of our staffers were flown down by the air force to survey the damage with the ideal of getting federal assistance on the way down trent was seated by my administrative assistant who ordinarily as a pilot himself had no problem with flying however on this occasion my aa developed a case of air sickness just before we landed in pensacola fl needless to say trent lott will not forget this either because he was the victim of my aas sickness and although trent was headed on to mississippi he had to delay the flight in pensacola for a few moments while

space and technology has seen fit to include provisions regarding development of a second source for solid rocket motors the government operations committee on which i serve held an extensive hearing on this issue last july at that hearing we heard from dr james fletcher the administrator of nasa the general accounting office which had done a study of the issue of development of such a second source and officials of several rocket motor manufacturers based on the record of that hearing i am convinced that competition in the procurement of solid rocket motors could result in both higher quality motors and lower costs of those motors to the government in addition to the cost benefits to the government a second source could assure nasa of a continuing supply of motors if the first supplier for any reason should be unable to deliver the number of motors necessary in the case of solid rocket motors the same company has supplied motors for the space shuttle since 1973 when the original contract was awarded since then there have been several additional buys of rocket motors all from the original supplier it has been reported in the trade press that this supplier will be given additional orders as contract add ons for parts of the new shuttlederived vehicle which will be used to launch the space station in the mid1990s yet there has been no further competition in this procurement as early as 1974only 1 year after the original procurement was negotiatedand several times since then nasa itself has considered development of a second source for these rocket motors for a variety of reasons these plans have never been fully implemented most recently in january 1986 in announcing plans to develop a second source nasa stated its objectives included expansion of the

having the vision to have this special order and permit those of us who had the pleasure and great pleasure of serving with john grotberg an opportunity to speak to the record for the future as well as to extend our deepest sympathies and affection for jean and for the entire grotberg family i miss john very much and as a democrat who sat on the other side of the aisle from him in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs i still find myself looking down to where his chair was we had the opportunity to work together on several bills and i came so much to appreciate his quick wit and wry humor i think even in his brief time here i could see the imprint of his experience in the illinois legislature when you saw him function as an effective member of our committee we were abletogether and just for the record i wanted to say that the last bill that he had a hand in here was public law 99202 december 23 1985 the save for the usa year which had to do with savings bonds and increasing the sale of our public debt securities to unitedstates citizens he and i worked on that together for a very long period of time and it is really the bill that permitted me to get to know him better as a person i thought for the record it might be interesting just to tell the story of this bill and how very much it meant to him we had to get signatures we had to get 218 signatures and he knew i was interested in savings bonds and he was as well so we decided to hitch up as a team within about 2 days john had over 70 signatures i said gosh john i said i cant keep up with you i said how in the world do you do it he said i know how to work a cloakroom we within just a few days had the required number of signatures and in that particular session of congress we had the only bill that managed to make it through that committee get passed on the floor of this house as well as over on the senate side and be signed into law by the president of the united states when we were getting our signatures on this side i said gosh john i said weve got a problem over in the other body theyre not moving very quickly he goes no problem follow me so we went out this middle door we walked across the rotunda we went over to the senate side and we went into the cloakroom over there and of course i was a little cautious i wanted the officer to clear me to go into the cloakroom and john said just walk right in we walked in and he said to the person at the desk wheres dole well it turned out that the majority leader at that time was in an airplane somewhere over the united states and john made sure that we made a telephone call right there and within 10 minutes senator dole was back to us in the cloakroom and john said when can you schedule it on the floor the senator informed us we should go see the speaker pro tem strom thurmond and we got off the telephone at that time senator dole had two huge boxes of chocolate candy over in the senate john and i both managed to grab a couple handfuls of that candy on the way out the door and we proceeded to find the speaker pro tems office without any knocking or anything john walked right in to the office and he said to the young woman sitting at the desk wed like to speak to the speaker pro tem who was standing back in the corner completely startled that these two members from the other side would have walked in unannounced like that and john walked up to him and said i happen to be a freshman this lady is a sophomore and we dont have anything important to do over there were just lowerranking members so we decided to really get on savings bonds this year and push them and we need your help we need your signature and heres the bill and senator thurmond stood there and kind of looked at this bill and looked at the two of us and it had to be one of the most unusual requests he had ever had and we got his signature within 15 seconds it was in that way then that we got the bill moved over in the senate senator dole scheduled it the next day and it passed the senate on december 16 1985 after having passed the house here on december 12 1985 it was then signed by the president i said to john before we left washington you know john this is such a big thing weve got to promote savings bonds in america when can we go over to the white house we have to get the president involved in this the first lady involved in this he said well why dont we do it in january i said ok john when he said well you take care of it im going on vacation i said oh john you have to be back here for that you cant miss an event like that that was the last time that i really had an opportunity to speak with him i never knew he was ill and he was going into the hospital that christmas and when i got back here in january to try to recoup and to put our agenda together to go over to the white house i found that he was in intensive care never to come out again last year i had to go before the national committee the private sector group that promotes savings bonds sales in the united states and to accept a liberty bell on behalf of both john and myself for our efforts in promoting this particular legislation which resulted last year in the largest number of savings bonds sales in the united states in several decades i will tell you it was a very emotional moment for me because i felt that i wanted to say so many things for john he was alive at that point and i wanted him to be there with me and he was not able to be there so i think this bill and the savings bonds sales in 1986 are a true tribute to
