offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.00804072618484497, 0.991959273815155, 1, "mr chairman and my colleagues in the house of representatives we begin now consideration of the first of four budget resolutions made in order by the rule governing house concurrent resolution 115the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is the constructive alternative budget resolution fashioned by the 18 members of thecongressional black caucus of the house of representatives it is the one budget resolution among the four to be considered by the house which responds most succinctly and directly to the mandate given the congress and the president by the american people on november 4 1980 of the four alternatives before us it does the best job of eliminating deficit spending reducing the level of federal spending providing tax relief to the american people and spurring jobs and economic recovery for american businesses and american workers the 18 members of the congressional black caucus are now about to detail for your consideration and debate a resolution that balances the budget in fiscal year 1982 which indeed offers the american people a 7 85 billion surplus instead of the 50 4 deficit that the reaganstockman proposal imposes upon us it is a budget that spends 7 95 billion less than djes the reaganstockman proposal it in a budget resolution that offers the american people 56 4 billion in tax cuts nearly 2 billion more in tax relief than does the reagan stockman proposal and we do it in a fashion that will not concentrate 80 percent of the business and industry tax incentives among the major corporations while providing only 20 percent of the tax relief to the small businesses of the nation which account for 48 percent of private sector gross national products and employ 80 percent of the working people of the country i want you to pay particular attention to the presentations of representative ranoel and representative ford on the tax package that is part of this resolution for it goes to the heart of why we are able to respond best to the mandate of the american people the american people want a new beginning but not a new beginning that is business as usual what good is a socalled tax cut that does not deal with bracket oreep that keeps throwing american workers into higher and higher tax brackets with no real increase in income the reagan proposal continues business as usual inthis regard the congressional black caucus budget resolutionalone among the alternativesgives us a new beginning by correcting bracket creep and returning 17 billion to the american people in tax relief the reaganstockman proposal gives the american taxpayers business as usual when it fails to take into account the increased social security payments that american wage earners and businesses will have to pay this year the cbc budget gives the amer1can taxpayer and small businesses a new beginning a 10percent tax credit on social security payments that returns 10 8 billion zo the american employee and another 7 2 billion to the businesses of our country the 10percent a year acrosstheboard tax cut proposal of the reagan administration is more of the same old thing it will have the average worker earning 15 000 a year paying 93 more in federal taxes by 1984 while the twotenths of 1 percent of the people who earn 200 000 a year will have the government return nearly 20 000 a year to them the american people voted for a new beginning not more of the same old thing with respect to the budget and tax policies of this nation they voted for a balanced budget and reduced federal spending and tax relief not for a legalized raid on the treasury by rich individuals and multinational corporations that will rob the people of 220 billion a year in tax revenues by 1986 they voted for a strong america not an america weekened by throwing 1 1 million people out of work which the reagan human needs budget cuts alone would do in fiscal year 1982 and the fauntroy amendment gives them that they voted for a just and compassionate america not a callous america that would deny a 1 5 billion free lunch to hungry children while continuing a 3 billion free lunch program for the rich that we call the three martini lunch deduction the fauntroy amendiment gives the amerncan people what they voted for it is living proof that the budget can be balanced government spending decreased and tax relief given without necessarily cutting back before yielding to my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to provide you more of the details of our constructive alternative budget resolution let me say three things about this budget resolution that the democraitic study group described as the substitute that takes the boldest step of any proposal being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit that offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house and that accomplishes all of this without hurting other important national programs the first is that while the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is authored by black legislators it is not a program for black people only the most serious problems confronting this nation just happen to be reflected most acutely in the black experience this is a program for all americans the elde ly on limited income most of whom are white the struggling young couples all over the nation who want but cannot find affordable housing anywhere most of whom are white the coal miners whose black lung benefits are being threatened most of whom are white young people from low and middleincome families who would be denied guaranteed student loans and basic opportunity grants for higher education most of whom are white the sick the cold the hungry the handicapped most of whom are white and all of whose burdens will be made heavier by the grammlatta budget proposal thus the solutions we seek are not for black people only but solutions that will benefit all americans black and white together young and old together rich and poor together protestant catholic jew and gentile together the second thing i want to point out is that our constructive alternative budget is based on a different assessment of the root cause of the problem we are experiencing in our domestic economy and the arena of world affairs than that of the reagan administration a in the area of the economy we maintain that inflation unemployment and loweconomic growth are not caused by government spending government taxation and government regulation as the administration would have us believe imprudence in each of these areas contributes to our economic woes and we are as determined as president reagan to sort out waste fraud and abuse at all levels of government expenditures but the fact is that our economic woes have nothing to do with the fact that we provide food stamps for the hungry medicaid for the sick housing for the poor and public service employment for the jobless our economic difficulties are rooted in the fact that other people are making better mousetraps nowadays our difficulties are rooted in the fact that over the past 15 years or more we have had a steady decline in economip performance in manufacturing output in product design and in productivity in sector after sector we are producing insufficient quantities of poorly designed products at too high a price when you do that not only does the world not buy what we make but we do not buy what we make this is best illustrated by an experience which i had a few months ago looking for a christmas gift for my young son marvin he said he wanted a portable radio for christmas i went to one of our local department stores and saw on the shelf a portable radio by rca amfm 87 i was about to purchase it when i noticed on another shelf something called sanyo it said amfm radio three speakers and tape recorder 47 now i love america and i have sense enough to know that when i purchase american made products i am sustaining jobs for americans but when i saw something better for less i must candidly admit that i bought the sanyo and i did it not because i like strange sounding names but because it was a better mousetrap the problem with our economy is that most americans are doing just what i did we are buying datsun toyota kawasaki suzuki honda yamaha panasonic sony seiko nikon and pentax that is our problem and it will not be solved by denying students basic opportunity grants or poor children free lunch or the elderly poor medicaid the problem is that we are losing market shares in the world at large as well as at home the consequence is rising unemployment inadequate profits and therefore reduced investments still worse productivity a falling dollar and still worse inflation our goal therefore must be to restore productivity the competitiveness of unitedstates industry and our other major economic sectors in both domestic and world markets to do this we must undertake the most fundamental reassessment of our economic structure since 1932or perhaps of all time as our colleague representative augustus hawkins has repeatedly pointed out and will do so again today to remedy that problem we must begin to implement the policies called for in the humphreyhawkins full employment and balanced growth act the third thing i should like to say is that the congressional black caucus makes a different assessment of what our problems are in the areas of world affairs our view is that our problems in 1hternational affairs do not lend themselves to military solution they are social economic and political in nature and thus we have emphasized a strong national economy and food and technical assistance as the primary weapons in the arsenal for our confrontation with soviet russia we favor improved national security but without wasteful military spending our budget as representative dellums will point out today calls for defense of our nation not domination of the world our emphasis on the area of foreign affairs must be for example upon development aid and technical assistance to nations like zimbabwe so that mr mugabe may build roads from the chromium mines to the sea where we can buy it sail it to detroit and make a kcair that goes a longer way to empty than does datsun that is what we need to be doing finally our speaker of the house thomas tip oneill has prominently displayed on a desk in his office in the capitol a quote from hubert humphreys last speech on capitol hill on november 17 1977 i think that quote summarizes the choices we must make this week on our budget resolutions he said the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shaows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the three other choices before you this week fail the moral test of government the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute which we now detail for you passes that test with flying colors i yield for the distinguished gentleman from new york to open our presentation of the details of our proposal"], [0.008398830890655518,

to~help the rich i hope we will not continue down a deadend street of believing in what president reagan calls the magic of the marketplace empirical evidence of six recessions in the postwar period resulting from similar tight monetary and regressive fiscal policies now being pursued documents the fallacy of feeding the fat and starving the lean economics for those who care to think objectively and to heed commonsense i am inserting into the record the report of the national advisory council on economic opportunity a governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [0.008784651756286621, 0.9912153482437134, 1, "house resolution 470 provides for the consideration of the bill to authorize the

banking committee estimates a time lag of at least 1 year for the bidding process to be completed and the coins to be minted and sold each day of delay jeopardizes prospects of making the kind of sales which will genuinely benefit our athletes and the olympic committee the committee substitute will be made in order as an original bill for the purpose of amendment the rule is open so that any amendment germane to the bill will be in order however the rule does specifically make one amendment and one substitute in order it will be in order to consider an amendment printed in the record of may 19 1982 by and if offered by representative st germain it will further be in order to consider an amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the congressional record of may 19 1982 by and

was essential to fully air the differences of opinion in a manner which is fair to all parties since the members of the house will have sufficient time to consider two very different approaches to the sale of olympic coins i will not devote a great deal of time here to a description briefly the legislation managed on the floor by chairman st germain proposes to mint legal tender coins in 17

olympics is required from any private marketer receipts from sales would be split between the private marketers the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee the substitute proposed by mr annunzio and reported by the consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee recommends one silver and one gold coin marketing would be accomplished through the mint as opposed to private marketers and through bulk sales only foreign sales would be arranged through private marketers who would be chosen in a competitive bidding process all sales would require a surcharge to be divided equally between the los angeles olympic operating committee and the unitedstates olymplc committee for training and construction of training facilities though there may be disagreement over the best method of marketing an olympic coin there is no disagreement about the importance of minting an olympic coin in july and august of 1984 los angeles will be the site of the xxiii olympiad it will be the first time in half a century that a city in the united states has served as host to this prestigious sporting event and the first time in history any nation has been host to three olympic games over 150 nations throughout the world are planning to compete before a worldwide audience that could number in the billions an olympic coin program is important in two respects the tradition of minting special coins can be traced back centuries to the ancient greeks throughout history special coins played a role in generating enthusiasm and support for the games and more recently have helped fund the staging of the games so that countries from all over the world could participate second the coin program plays an important role in providing support for the training of our athletes this training is a longterm process financial support is critical to our ability to provide american youth of all ages and skills the opportunity to develop their athletic ability and to

atlanta ga is clearly indicative of the sickness which is eroding the fibers of our society violence is becoming more and more a way of life throughout our nation the atlanta slayings and related attacks against children are very cogent symbols that we are moving further away from the highest regard for human life it frightens me deeply to acknowledge the significant psychological damage which is growing among all children due to the recent incidences while the victims of these murders have all been black it is no secret that such acts of violence do not discriminate the fundamental question we must face now is that any child may be forced to live in fear during every phase of a days activity surely the increased number of weaponcarrying schoolchildren momentary periods of panic if a parent is late picking up a schoolchild and decrease in academic achievement are not peculiar to the findings of several atlanta psychiatrists psychologists and mental health officials the feelings of distrust fear and apprehension wih spread among all of our nations children as they begin ti dread functioning in everyday environments this is a sad outlook for our future another fundamental question which is magnifici in the minds of those who fear for human safety is the continuing focus away from human needs we are forced now to question if whether or not the evils of poverty deprivation and unemployment may be so deep rooted in our society that respect for human life becomes secondary to mere survival we are also forced to question the validity of continuous violence as romanticized and glamourized on our television and movie screens the situations in georgia florida maryland and throughout most regions in this country leave us frustrated and angry they leave us to question the basic responsiveness of authorities who must become more adamant in the protection of human lives however they must not lead us to take the law into our own hands the widespread acts of violence must also remind us that the protection and preservation of human lives are crossjurisdictional when as many as 21 lives are lost it cannot be pegged as a state or local government matter both the president and the congress realized this and i laud the dispersal of federal funds to atlanta and the efforts to appropriate 1 5 and 1 8 million for use by this city we have to examine closely the cli mate that motivates and encourages psychotic violence the violence of racism the aforementioned influence of television and movies and the violence of war and militarismall of these inevitably get reflected in individual behavior to a greater or lesser degree he psychotic killers who murder our children in atlanta or any where else are victims of this climate and have apparently been affected to a greater degree we cannot excuse this behavior however we can and must deal squarely with the environment which fosters such actions several sociologists tell us that most of the slain atlanta children come from public housing neighborhoods which are more vulnerable and conducive to human mistreatment abduction and even death such conditions and incidences are not limited to this region of the country right here in washington d c children from lowincome housing projects are becoming more and more susceptible to conditions of drug abuse and molestation here the elimination of unemployment underemployment and poverty must precede the eradication of such criminal acts it is not easy to warn the blacks of atlanta to stay away from theories that the acts of violence against 21 black children are conspiratorial in nature or racially motivated the pattern of systematic murders rapes additional overt and covert actions against black citizens in the south and throughout this country is still just too prevalent however we must assist in the efforts of mayor maynard jackson the numerous task forces and concerned cftizens in addressing the problem in a rational way again until we eliminate the fundamental societal ills we cannot be shocked at deviant behavioral patterns of violence irresponsibility and total disregard for human lives there is little help in calling on citizens to care about each other when increasing inequities among neighborhoods schools living standards and opportunities have become a way of life those of us who are in a position to have impact on public policy must stand firm against further inequities and burdens on our children elderly and lowincome citizens we must promote the kind of solidarity which has been displayed as citizens across the nation have rallied behind the victimized atlanta families most importantly we must not be afraid to oppose and openly attack racism chronic unemployment poverty

social security issue into perspective as a result of the reagan administrations scare tactics the public is confused and worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign for the presidency mr reagan promised that he would preserve the social security system as a safety net we now see that this was just so much more campaign rhetoric already mr reagan and his chief budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax bill"],

in this country president reagan was right when he spoke the other night and said that millions of americans harbor the simple wish for a safe and financially secure future for their children but in fact the president is deceiving the american people into thinking that his policies will achieve such ends the administration would have us dismantle programs and policies for children and families that took 30 years to develop but on the basis of what evidence would he have us dismantle those programs the administration argued that dismantling these programs will save money but all our evfdence from the wic program for lowincome pregnant women and their infants all the evidence from the fledgling foster care reform program all of the evidence from the 17yearold title i program for educationally disadvantaged children shows just the opposite without these programs of prevention the longterm costs to the american taxpayer would have been far greater the administration argues on the basis of a few anecdotal cases that dramatic funding cuts for these programs will eliminate waste fraud and abuse if the administrations real concern is with the waste fraud and abuse why is there no administration effort to go after waste fraud and abuse in the defense budget just this week it was reported that paul thayer who is chairman of ltv a major ddfense contractor told the president that i have been in the defense contracting for over 30 years and i can tell you that 40 percent of the cost of planes i sell is attributable to redtape bureaucracy and duplicative expenditures forty percent is there a person in this congress who has been hearing lately of 40 percent of social program expenditures that are a result of redtape bureaucracy and duplicative expenditures i do not believe so that has never been alleged in this congress and yet those are the programs that have received the heaviest cuts while the heaviest increases have gone to the pentagon in fadt there has been a careful refinement of those social programs by the congress over the past years which has eliminated untargeted use of funds and abuses by program operators even in the falsely discredited food stamp program which we tend to forget has been the single most important force in eradicating hunger and malnutrition in this country even in this program usdas own figures show that fully 95 percent of the food stamp recipients are in fact eligible recipients the administration also argues that the drastic cuts in social programs are the oni hope for balancing the budget but this is patently false as the omb director stockman so convincingly revealed last year in his interview with the atlantic monthly president reagan is not willing to renege on his commitment to the wealthy individuals and corporations even by closing the huge tax loopholes or by eliminating special interest favors but the president and his advisers apparently have no qualms about breaking decades of commitments to our most valuable and vulnerable americans children and lowincome families it is time to set the record straight the programs this congress created over the past several decades are working they are saving money they are helping children to become productive citizens we did not develop these programs in the first place simply because the congress had nothing to do one day each of these programs was developed in response to some clearly identified need on the basis of extensive investigations and hearings by the congress and as a result of testimony from state and local officials who asked for our guidance and our assistance we made the commitment to those states localities and school districts as well as to the children and the parents they serve they depend on that commitnient on the basis of what evidence would we now throw away 30 years of work in these longstanding programs on the basis of what evidence would we now disinantle a program that brought this country from the depths of the depression to being the richest the freest the strongest the most able country in the history of the world as we are being asked to dismantle these programs let me ask a simple question what is it that we are apologizing for are we going to apologize for having the most successful education system in the entire world for having more young people enrolled in college than any other country for having greater literacy than any other country are we going to apologize for traveling over the best transportation system of any country in the world for cutting down the cost of bringing our goods and services to market are we going to apologize for having the best harbors and networks for the best inland and boat ways of any place in the world are we going to apologize to the millions of americans who had their homes financed by fha by the veterans programs are we going to apologize for the government providing mortgage assistance and other programp for millions of americans are we going to apologize for the fact that even today the government is spending millions of dollars to keep the savings and loans institutions from going broke thirty years ago there would have been a panic if this many savings and loans were on the poor list if this many savings and loans had to merge but it is the federal government that is picking up the pieces to the tune of millions of dollars in just the last few months because of bad management are we going to apologize because the federal government assisted tens of thousands of farmers across this country that created the most productive agricultural system in the world that not only feeds everyone in this country at lowest cost but feeds a good portion of the rest of the world and provides vital foodstuffs for those people on what evidence is one man who comes into office who weekly demonstrates his lack of knowledge of the workings of these programs and others on what evidence is this one man asking us to turn back the clock to go where we were 20 years ago to dismantle the federal government a federal government that has served the people of this country well that has provided nutrition that has provided health care for the elderly for the poor education for our children who is going to educate the next generation of children who is going to provide health care to the next generation of the elderly who is going to finance the next generation of housing the president would have us believe that charity and the private sector would they never have in the past and i do not know why they would start now there is no indication in fact that they plan to i think that as we consider the impact of last years budget cuts and as this congress engages in another round of budget cuts we had better understand the multiple impacts that these cuts start to build on our nations children as we start to cut title xx which provides help for foster grandparents programs and for children awve start to cut the education programs as the gentleman who sits with me on the education and labor committee knows we sat through several hours of hearings this morning with local representatives of the national school boards association and not one of them could tell our committee how education is better today for this nations children than it was a year ago not one of them could provide an example of how we are better serving the children of this country then we were a year ago the question this congress must face and hopefully can be addressed not only in this special order but can be addressed throughout the rest of this year is where is the evidence who can say that life is better for those children than it was a year ago let me remind you that none of those children yet have been proven to be fraudulent have been proven to be wastefull have been proven to abuse the programs that this congress and this couritry designed to help them i think before we go any further this administration has an obligation to the people of this country to show them the evidencenot the hope not the desire not the promises but the hard evidence about how their program will treat children better this year than it did last year and next year better than it did this year because these is no evidence to suggest that that will take place again i want to thank the gentleman from new york who has been deeply involved in trying to provide for those who are less fortunate than the rest of us and who has provided tremendous leadership in this congress on childrens issues every fourth of july the politicians of our country stand up and say children are our most important resource the future of our country if we do not provide for these children the country will not exist in the future if we ignore these resources we will truly be poor i guess they figure on the fourth of july the children are all of a sudden not paying attention because the rest of the year these politicians slash the budgets they ignore the children who cannot vote and so are not listened to but on the fourth of july they look at a child waving the flag and they teil that child you my dear are our worlds most important

i believe will result in the most dramatic and substantial change in federal fiscal policy that has occurred in this country in the last 50 years whether we are democrat or republican i think all of us read what the american people were demanding last november they asked that there be serious restraint on the growth of federal spending and that we get our fiscal house in order the alternatives before us today regardless of which one you are talking about have a substantial dramatic change in federal fiscal policy from the outset i would like to reiterate what i stated when i asked my colleagues to elect me chairman of the committee on the budget and that is this that the funandgames time for the budget process is over if you want to continue the budget process then we ought to build a budget based on reality build a budget that will stand the test of time and pass a budget which we will support when the individual authorizing and appropriations bills come before the house of representatives i think we have the lattakemproth substitute or the republican substitute and the committee bill present a clear choice in many respects of ways to proceed on budget policy quite frankly i have been somewhat disturbed by reports that some of our colleagues say for political or other reasons they are going to support this or that alternative but that it really does not mean anything because when they come back to the authorizing votes and to the appropriating votes they will vote the other way what i want to set out from the very beginning is that so long as i am chairman of the committee on the budget i intend to do everything in my power to make the budget process realno more fun and gamesso that those who vote for the budget resolutions will know what is in those resolutionsand they will be expected to vote the same way when the individual authorizing and appropriating bills come before the house many people think that they can vote one way because of the immediate political pressure on them but that the pressure will be off 1 week from now 2 weeks from now 1 month from now i think it is incumbent upon every member of this body to know what is in these resolutions to know what they are voting on what they are cutting and what kind of tax program they are providing because those who look to you on this vote will be looking to you on subsequent votes to be consistent if you think you get out from under the pressure by casting a vote one way today and changing it the next time you are not going to do it because the same interest groups that are after you today will be after you tomorrow and you will look worse by being inconsistent so i hope that you will make it a point to know what is in these various alternatives some of the reports i have heard that my colleagues indicate that they may support the republican substitute they should keep in mind that it really does include the kemproth tax bill and there is no way to get around it the president of the united states just a few days ago from this chamber said that the tax program the kemproth tax program was integral to his program that there would be no compromise no alternative so those of you who vote for the latta republican substitute are voting for the kemproth tax bill and you ought to know it some say that a vote for the latta substitute does not include any kind of severe cuts in elementary and secondary education that is wrong the substitute includes deep cuts 25 percent cuts in elementary and secondary education and most of those cuts are going to affect education for handi capped children and you ought to know it some who have indicated that they may support the republican substitute say that that does not mean that we are not going to provide for filling the strategic petroleum reserve and that is not true the substitute cuts the support for the strategic petroleum reserve by 75 percent there is no way to get around it and you ought to know it when you vote the substitute i might also add will raise a point of order against the appropriation of 3 billion for the strategic petroleum reserve that is pending and ready to come to thenfoor of the house next week and you ought to know it some say that they may support the republican substitute but that it does not contain any cuts in vocational education or job training and that is not true it cuts vocational education it cuts job training and you ought to know it all i am saying is whether you are talking about the cuts in agricultural programs the cuts in job training the cuts in education or the kemproth tax bill if you feel you want to support that i will never question any member of this body on that decision you have your own reasons and you ought to vote for those reasons all i am saying is let us be consistent let us be honest with the american people and you vote today as you are going to vote for the rest of this year on the 1982 budget the budget committee will be keeping with the responsibilities we have a scorecard as to where we are and that scorecard is going to be embarrassing for some people if they are not consistent as the year goes on so that is one of the first points i wanted to make that is that i take my responsibility as chairman of this committee on the budget very seriously and whatever this body passes i will attempt to enforce to the letter now i want briefly to state how the committee resolution got to its present form because it was not a happen stance event it was guided by a number of principles and a number of goals that i personally had and the committee had a number of goals that were laid out after i was elected chairman of this committee the overriding goal that directed my attention was to put together a budget that would truly lessen the pressures on inflation unless we keep that goal uppermost we are npt responding to what the american people said they wanted in the elections last november what can we do to get inflation down another goal was to try to limit federal spending as a percent of gross national product many of you recall and some of you cosponsored the efforts we made in the last congress to start limiting federal spending and the first step was to limit federal spending to 22 5 percent of gnp that goal was achieved in this committee resolution as a matter of fact we actually cut spending more in aggregate terms than the administration recommended in its march 10 budget a third overriding goal was to recommend a tax policy designed to meet the needs of our country and the american people today in that connection we looked at various tax programs and compared kemproth to other possibilities and we found over and over again that the kemproth tax bill would in effect a keynesian consumptionoriented tax policy it would stimulate demand there is no question about it"], [0.011296331882476807, 0.9887036681175232, 1, "i would only allude to a few comments admiral laroche of the center for defense information quoted lord mountbatten the brilliant british military person who said in 1979 i have come to the conclusion that nuclear weapons are not military weapons because nuclear weapons cannot be used and the danger that imperils humankind on the face of this earth is the perception the illusion that nuclear weapons can be used to me this was an eloquent and powerful statement that nuclear weapons are never to be used but only for deterrence but the supporting documents for this military budget fiscal year 1983 say we must have the capacity to fight to survive and win a nuclear war anyone who believes we can fight survive and win a nuclear war bydefinition with all due respect is psychotic every analyst i have seen indicates that no one wins in a nuclear war there is no such as a limited war a surgical strike where 20 to 100 million human beings are dead what is limited and surgical about that i would quote dr geiger the executive director of the physicians for social responsibility who said as i look at the united states and the soviet union and their nuclear arms race i think of two men and i think that is appropriate because it is very sexist and macho to play war gamestwo men in a room locked tight up to their throats in gasoline one standing there with 10 matches and the other standing there with 7 matches and they are both arguing over whether they need 15 matches apiece before they can agree not to strike 1 match in that room that is where we are that is precisely where this arms race is millions of the american people are beginning to awaken to the reality that nuclear war is insanity bloated wasteful and unnecessary military budgets are not in our best interests finally my colleagues are talking about a 5percent addon for fiscal year 1983 military budget as if these numbers make some sense the point is that fiscal year 1982 was an incredibly high base in fiscal year 1981 the military budget in budget authority terms was 173 billion in fiscal year 1982 it went up to 226 billion 25 percent over and above that is incredible we must remember that ronald reagan stomped us in 1982 and put the military budget at an incredible level so let me give the members these figures because it also includes the black caucus budget when you go back to 1981 as a base 1982 which was terribly out of line the jones budget if we use 1981 figures calls for 32 9percent increase in 2 years the aspin budget in 2 years calls for a 31 3percent increase the latta budget 33 4percent increase in the military budget in 2 years the obey budget 30 6 percent and even this socalled radical document known as the congressional black caucus that budget is still 25 percent over and above fiscal year 1981 a 12 5 average increase in 2 years so yoticannot tell me or any other rational human being that we are not pouring an incredible amount of money in our military budget in conclusion i would simply say think analyze evaluate and debate let us not reduce ourselves to some hucksters and hustlers and auctioneers here we are thinking human beings committed to establishing policy lot us stop the madness of nuclear war

ministers from the chicago area who have journeyed here to participate in the clergy crusade and lobby the government regarding the traumatic effect the presidents fiscal year 1983 budget if passed by congress would have upon the poor the elderly the unemployed and the children it is appropriate that these ministers have chosen to come to washington this weekthe week the house will use the presidents fiscal year 1983 budget as the vehicle for the consideration of the latta and house budget committee alternative i would like to tell these ministers that this will be the week in which my colleagues will vote conscientiously and courageously by defeating the presidents budget and others which throw tax dollars to the pentagon at the expense of people programs it is doubtful that will be the case i unequivocally oppose the presidents budget primarily because of my concern over the devastating impact his budget will have upon millions of americans specifically children and the elderly president reagan has stated on too many occasions that the truly needy will not be affected by the proposed budget cuts i am sure these chicago clergy can attest to a more realistic scenario the truly needy along with unemployed middle class and bankrupted businessmen are dropping like flies through the safety net and the president has the audacity to propose even larger holes in that net it is my belief that the reagan 1983 budget undermines the moral responsibility of government to the citizens of america i agree with the great american hubert humphrey who stated the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the president has failed this test last year under his leadership the president claimed that his budget proposal was fair in fact however its cuts were disproportionately directed at programs to assist the poor and the disadvantaged including investment in health education training services and public works this year the administration has not bothered to pay lip service to the idea of fairness it has once again targeted for cutbacks the same programs which sustained deep speeding reductions last year under this budget the children will see an additional 8 billion cut in their programs child nutrition services will be cut by 334 million in budget au thority and 300 million in outlays the summer feeding programa program which helps preserve nutritional gains made by children during the school yearwill be terminated the special milk program a program which subsidizes milk consumption in schools that do not participate in other federal meal programs will be eliminated school breakfast and child care food programs will be placed in a block grant while grants for nutrition education will be terminated medicaid a health insurance program which pays the medical bills for lowincome americans children and pregnant women will again bear the brunt of the reiagan cuts the federal child support enforcement program a program which par tially reimburses states and localities for expenses in collecting child support payments from absent parents would also be drastically impacted if that is not enough approximately 165 000 women infants and children will be dropped in fiscal year 1983 from the wic program due to inadequate funding and 370 000 would have to be cut off by fiscal year 1985 this means that some half a million fewer people would be reached suffer the little children the aged and elderly are of course to assume an even heavier burden if the presidents budget is passed they can look forward to changes in the federal supplemental income ssi program which will exclude some 115 000 individuals in fiscal ydar 1983 who will not be considered permanently disabled food stamps will receive a 1 3 billion decrease from the fiscal year 1982 authorized spending level for working poor families this amounts to encouraging them not to worka philosophy supposedly counter to the reagan work ethic for our elderly less food coupled with less food stamps the lowincome energy assistance program will be cut conceivably our seniors may not have a choice between heat or eat they will not be able to do either under medicaid we would witness major legislative changes which would cut the federal payment for all services for medically needy recipients in addition to including federal payments to the states for administering medicaid in a new welfare block grant last year the president claimed he would preserve a social safety net of basic programs to protect the poor and elderly despite this claim the administration and its congressional allies forced cuts in virtuqlly every safety net program this years budget proposal continues this policy and proposes a new round of reductions in the safety net programs with cuts being requested in medicare afdc supplemental security income and others this is deplorable and further strengthens my resolve to support the program submitted by the congressional black caucus which

the adoption of house joint reso lution 220 proclaiming raoul wallenberg to be an honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who underscored the critical importance from both a national and international perspective of recognizing raoul wallenberg in this unique way for the

equality women have worked so hard for and certainly deserve like the right to vote the right to equality under the law will become part of the constitution i am proud to be among those to reintroduce the equal rights amendment in congress and continue tlfe campaign for its ratification confident of success the drive for the equal rights amendment has changed american politics never before have so many women raised so much money been so active in lobbying and campaigning and learned so much about politics according to pollster louis harris one of the major developments of this decade will be the fullblown emergence of women as a powerful new force in american politics public officials everywhere will be held accountable and those legislators who have voted against women will be replaced i would like to interject one anecdote while campaigning last weekend back in my district i went through a factory where there was an elderly gentleman who said that he had been working every day of his life and was thrilled that i was a congresswoman i asked why he said he had been working every day of his life to support his three daughters and he feels that when he passes away i will continue to support them in my own way one is a doctor one is a lawyer and the third a housewife with children he firmly believed that unless we had more women taking up the responsibilities and posijuy 14 1982 tions of women we would not be able to obtain that type of equality under the law that this gentleman believed was so very necessary the argument that we do not need the era because there are no longer any discriminatory laws is completely wrong genderbased laws can be as picayune as the north carolina statute that requires a husband but not a wife to go to court for a legal name change if the couple wants to use a combined or hyphenated name or the laws can be reflective of deeprooted stereotypes such as the georgia law that states that the husband is the head of the family and the wife i subject ot him married women are the big losers property rights marital regulations provisions for separation and divorce and statutes concerning wills and intestate succession combine to discriminate against womenwhether they are homemakers work in a familyowned business work outside the home are widowed are divorced or getting a divorce so despite the many rights that women have won over the past decade equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law are incomplete and impermanent the rights we have gained could be revoked by changes in the political balance of congress administrative action or a realinement of the supreme court without the era in the constitution the shift of a few votes could wipe out equal employment opportunity equal access to credit and equal education many womens rights were enacted by small margins for example the law that gives a woman the right to sue an employer who discriminates against her would not be on the books if three senators had changed their minds the reason the era has not yet been ratified is because a few state legislators who ignored the wishes of their constituents and a vast majority of citizens throughout the country these legislators bottled the era up in committee tied it up by parliamentary maneuver and used backroom political pressure to defeat it but those days are past i expect the new erawith the same simple straightforward languageto win approval in congress and then be ratified by the required 38 states state elections will make all the differencewith legislators who oppose era held accountable i believe the era drive will be looked upon as the turning point in the womens movement women will move from being spectators to the inside political track i firmly believe that era more than anything else is a bread and butter issue for women 70 percent of the nations poor are women according to the national advisory council on economic opportunity this figure could rise to 100 percent before 2000 thp irony of this decade of advancement for women is that it has also been the decade of the feminization of poverty while this is most prevalent among elderly black and hispanic women the fastest growing segment of poor women are single white and ralsing children with no or little support jobs alone are not the answer while mens poverty is a consequence of unemployment womens is the result of occupational segregation in spite of the fact that more women are employed now than ever before 80 percent of these women are concentrated in traditional womens work service and cler cal jobs which are not only low paying but have declined in real earnings for years the great strides made by women into traditionally male occupations chiefly reflects their very low starting point

bipartisan and noncontroversial bill and i am pleased to join with my colleagues in supporting its passage i first want to commend the members who have worked on this bill i think we have dealt with this bill in a responsible manner we have given our seabed mining companies what they need an interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my remarks in short i believe the bill before us meets the foreign policy and national security interests of this country as well as the interests of the seabed mining industry and i urge the members to vote for the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill from foreign affairs spring 19801"], [0.9715197682380676,

dilemma and i include his remarks in the record as follows oxiz nationindxvxsxmze by carl 1 pursml it is certainly an honor for this congressman from michigan to bring his message to this gathering of the distinguished new england society of newspaper editors and publishers the topic at hand requires the critical examination broad perspective and practical application characteristic of editors and publishers a group known for getting to the point and demanding appropriate action ironically it may have been one of our most wellknown editors and publishers whose words are most associated with the problems of the northeast midwest region everyone remembers the wordsf of the new york tribunes horace greeley when he said go west young man those words were more than advisory they were prophetic from now until the year 2000 the census bureau expects the population of the socalled sun belt to grow at a rate four times that of the 18 states of the northeast and midwest the real reason as you know is not climate but jobs and while employment opportunities grow in the south and west the capital investment that creates jobs is lagging in our region during the past decade capital investment in the sun belt was nearly twice that of the northeast midwcst bome of the socalled experts have wit nessed this trend and proclaimed it inevitable as though it were some kind of modern extension to the concept of manifest destiny and seeing these developments in those terms these experts have solemnly advised the people of our region to stop their economic suffering forthwith and move to where the jobs are i think we would all question such advice you may not recall as readily another svored quote of horace greely the wusion that times that were are better than those that are has probably pervaded all ages i strongly believe that it is also an illusion to think that the times to be will not be better than those that are in short the best days for our region are ahead of us not in the golden days of the past by and large jobs are where you make them and with the proper balanced concern for the needs of the nation at large we can stand and act in accordance with that fact a continental country such as ours can do no less for it would make powerful little sense to move generation after generation of americans across our great land mass in quest of an elusive and everchanging job market such a policy would not only be economically infective but just plain inhumane our very history argues against it dec ades ago the federal government began to pursue a deliberate policy of investing billions of dollars in the economic revival of the south and development of the west massive amounts of dollars were poured into rural electrification projects like tva port construction military bases defense projects space programs oil subsidies tobacco and peanuts allotments and on and on the great northeast and midwest peoples never thought to question this policy because they were and are above all else americans with the greater interest of their nation at heart they never once thought that their own prosperity would suffer for having extended the hand of the federal government on behalf of their fellow americans in other regions but the times they are achanging the moment has come to realize that in economic terms the west has been won and the south has been reconstructed now it is time to draw a lesson from history and be reminded that what worked for the south and west will also work for the north and midwest which is ravished by an industrial complex badly in need of reconstruction and modernization needless to say our region desperately requires the industrial revenue base needed to rebuild its cities and to modernize its aging network of bridges road water and sewer systems yet despite these gaping needs the 18 states of the northeast and midwest collectively sent 165 billion more of their treasure to washington than they got back between 1975 and 1979 my state of micli gan gets back about 66 cents for every dollar going to our nations capital if we continue as we have we face an economnic balkanization that will serve no ones best interestsleast of all the nations one of the most vital tests for america today is whether we can frame a rational national economic development plan and in so doing avoid the terrible pitfall of creating economic upheavals that pit one region against another the truth is our various regions are parts of a single economic whole they are dependent on one another with each offering unique strengths and special resources the others lack the 18 states of the northeast and midwest spend too much time emphasizing problems rather than proclaiming how much we have to offer that the nation needs and can benefit from for example the great lakes st lawrence system and other sources provide the worlds largest supply of fresh water a vast expensive infrastructure including huge plant capacities and an integrated transportation system is in place and capable oi serving millions of people in large cities and smaller communities in an effective manner at far less than the cost of replacing it from the ground up our varied terrain provides opportunity for a wide assortment of activities while a continuous round of changing seasons presents excellent working conditions i might add at this point that the nickname frost belt is a misnomer for our climate is among the most temperate in the world minerals timber and other raw materials are abundant throughout and a varied mix of oil gas coal and hydroelectric energy remain in plentiful supply soil climate and other factors enable the region to not only feed its people but to export food and fiber throughout the world we have some of the worlds finest schools unparalleled research capabilities and a strong feeling of individual pride and community loyalty that cannot be measured the regions greatest resource is of course its peoplea skilled and motivated work force ready and willing to continue making productive contributions in existing industries while ready to meet the special demands of new technologies in congress i have been working primarily through two groups in an effort to secure equitable treatment of all regions by the federal government and to promote the positive contributions our region can make to the nation first the bipartisan northeast midwest congressional coalition of which i am a member of the steering committee and cochairman of its budget task force secondly an ad hoc group of northern republicans commonly referred to as the gypsy moths of which i am chairman most of the efforts of these two groups this yearlike those of congresshave centered around president reagans economic recovery program as you undoubtedly know i actively support the basic components of the presidents program and voted for the key implementing legislation when it came before the house of representatives namely reducing federal spending so as to beat inflation and bring down interest rates reducing individual and business taxes to provide investment capital and leave more money in the hands of workers and working to develop a bigger national economic pie rather than struggling over a shrinking pie that sets region against region and interest group against interest group while strongly supporting the presidents bottom line i believe that a certain amount of negotiating should take place in order to avoid certain rcgional distortions and other difficulties for example i had introduced legislation to phase in the tax cut over a fiveyear period rather than three years my greatest concerns related to the regional effects of rapidly raising defense spending while significantly decreasing domestic programs meanwhile conservative southern democrats now known as the boll weevils continue their traditional demands as the price for votes on key legislation year after year no matter who is president the boll weevils fight for three basic areas of immense benefit to their region public works 2 oil tax breaks and 3 defense spending let me give a typical example of each of these areas 1 the controversial tennesseetombigee projecta waterway running parallel to the mississippi riverreceived administration support and the house passed its fiscal year 1982 appropriations by a vote of 208 to 198 it is estimated that this project alone will eventually cost about 3 billion 2 oil tax breaks in the economic recovery act including exemptions to the windfall profits tax will cost over 12 billion during the iext three years 3 the administrations 15year defense plan calls for 1 46 trillion through fiscal year 1986 this is a particular boon to the sun belt as 80 percent of all dod employees are concentrated in the south and west california and georgia alone have more than all of the 18 states in our region combined in fact over the last decade defense department employment in the northeast midwest actually declined by about 30 percent it is our view that several billion dollars could be shifted from the proposed lncrrase in defense to needed domestic programs of vital importance to our region while not in any way harming national security in fact such a move could be helpful before completing his term of office earlier this year the distinguished comptroller general elmer b staats identified up to 10 billion in dod mismanagement and waste the house republican research committee has outlined as much as 25 billion savings through reductions in waste fraud abuse along with a restructuring of the procurement process in addition we are concerned that a too rapid increase in defense spending could even have a harmful effect on the military experts have predicted shortages of skilled labor in defense industriesespecially in the south capacity will be strained and managerial oversight stretched thin resulting in substantial costs overruns while my coalition and glypsy moth colleagues generally agree that a responsible trimming of the defense request will focus needed attention on the best way to achieve a truly effective military and strengthen defense by strengthening the economy there is less agreement on what domestic programs should be given the greatest emphasis this is due to the great diversity within our region the priorities of downtown manhattan are often not the same as those of the hills of vermont we fuund that out when we tried to help jim jeffords get that tax credit for wood burning stoves nevertheless we have had modest success during the past yea r in negotiating for the region for example president regan personally pledged i o me his support for continuation of a 3 4 billion test program targeting defense spending to high unemployment areasthe socalled maybank program the administratiorn agreed to shift approximately 2 7 billion ir budget priorities in the omnibus reconciliation act enacted in august from that originally called for in the spring this included funds for health medicaid education student loans vocational education youth training transportation amtrak conrail and mass transit as well as for energy conservation programs such as low income energy assistance and weatherization projects provisions were added to the tax bill to encourage rehabilitation of existing plants rather than moving operations to the south and west cooperative research and develop activities between private industry and universities and special tax treatment of tools used in automobile production i am proud of our work and i am thankful for the progress we have made but it is only a beginning representing a relatively small part of the effort needed to ensure lasting success so much of our work has been simply to retain what i call maintenance programs such as food stamps school lunches health care unemployment benefits and others vitally important but which do not contribute directly to our future growth and development needless to say we must continue this work but it must also be expanded ceta positions must be replaced by productive jobs in the private sector not welfare benefits health research must provide answers that replace health care benefits with preventative health practices high technology applications must supply the jobs laid off autoworkers cannot find on the assembly line if people are to live productive lives in the intercity they must be able to provide themselves with adequate housing transportation and education as a county commissioner i struggled with these issues hoping that the property tax along with revenues from state and federal government would provide the resources for meeting local needs as a state senator i struggled with the same problems but from a slightly different perspective that time i hoped that the income and sales taxes coupled with uncle sams contributions would balance the budget now as a member of congress i find that i am looking for answers to the same problems from yet another perspective while each level of government is working toward many of the same goals there exists a profound degree of fragmentation and isolation particular federal programs may or may not meet the peculiar needs of a certain community but the mayor or city manager grabs whatever federal funds are available and works them into a patchwork of federal state and local revenues in an effort to meet a strained budget state officials present their federal budget priorities not in terms of which programs are most effective but which ones will provide the most dollars as they work desperately to balance their budgets meanwhile mimbcrs of congress are presented with such a vast array of demands and corresponding programs that they can hardly keep up with their content and legislative status to say nothing of their implementation unfortunately government officials do not have a monopoly on this parochial method for dealing with problems competition and lack of communication are often the rule in relations between labor and management private industry and the schools producing future employees and yes cocasionally even between leader of the press and the communities they serve where 0 where do we stop and take a coordinated look at the needs of a particualr community or region and develop a comprehensive plan for its development and operation instead we continue living in a vacuum from year to year with little planning on a longterm basis and even less coordination among related jurisdictions in my view if we truly are to deal with our problems in an effective manner we must address the chaotic situation li have just described we must do it by region within states and we must do it by region within the united states in that regard i would like to share briefly with you two proposals i have advanced together with the detroit news i have suggested a statewide leadership conference in my home state of michigan to serve as a catalytic mechanism for key decisionmakers to sit down together and hammer out a comprehensive agenda it would consist of a working group of 6075 peoplelarge enough to reflect the spectrum of michigans people and interests but small enough to allow meaningful interaction with one another some years ago i organized a similar broadbased conference to set an agenda for the future of communities around my home town it has been extremely successful in identifying goals and producing results secondly i discussed with president reagan and subsequently presented the white house with a draft of a proposal for creation of a northeast midwest economic advisory council the general purpose of which would be to assemble members of congress governors mayors and other representatives of each level of government federal state and local within the region to advise the president and congress with respect to the federal governments role in helping meet the problems of the northeast midwest as well as in the development and use of the areas vast resources i see four main functions of such a council it would 1 serve as the governments focal point in considering the ne nws regional implications of federal policy 2 gather information necessary from public and private sources for meaningful consideration of these implications 3 serve as a vehicle by which representatives of the private sector as well as public officials can interact with federal personnel during the policy making process and 4 advise the president and congress on a continuing basis issuing formal reports when appropriate this is of course just one proposal and i welcome your reactions to it as well as challenge you to come forth with any other creative ideas for affecting the decisionmaking process in such a way as to best serve simultaneously the interests of our region and the nation as well it is essential that this goal be met to everyones good fortune the economy of the sun belt will continue to thrive but that growth does not require the continued decline of our region over time the supposed advantages of the sun belt may

amendments the life expectancy of americans continues to grow and so correspondingly does the senior population the growing numbers and proportions of seniors is certainly a triumph for our nation it reflects the improved quality of life in america and allows it to continue to improve by using the knowledge and experience of our senior citizens as one of our greatest assets we can expect great demographic changes by the end of this century as the nations senior population becomes a greater percentage of the population as a whole the older americans act was originally established in 1965 to meet the needs of the elderly community for community and social services our vote to reauthorize the older americans act reaffirms this nations high sense of responsibility toward the wellbeing of the growing senior population the needs of the elderly are generaliy different from those of the rest of the population and within the category elderly there are people with specific needssome who are basically healthy and able and others who are frail and dependent the older american act addresses the needs of the entire elderly population because of the wide range of services which states may provide with funds authorized by this act the older americans act has been very successful in its purpose of improving the quality of life for our citizens in the areas of income housing health employment and community services the amendments of 1981 include some changes which will make it easier to achieve these goals title v provides senior citizens with the opportunity to be employed in the community service if they desire to work and supplement their income the 1981 amendments also include weatherization activities as an appropriate community service in my home state of maine there are many citizens particularly the elderly whose homes are not energy efficient but who cannot physically manage to make such improvements to their homes the winters in maine are verycold and these people continue to spend an increasing portion of their limited incomes on energy with the reduction in funds this year for weatherization programs i was pleased to see the community services employment program granted the option of placing ablebodied seniors in jobs where they can help other senior citizens fix up their homes and save money on heating bills an other important improvement

the possibility of using a portion of the funding under title iiic for transportation to the meal sites maine is a very rural state and many or our elderly are isolated the 1981 amendments will allow

act there is also an extension of the plder americans volunteer programs administered by the action agency these include foster grandparents senior companions and the retired senior volunteer progium

health nutrition and education these volunteer programs have been very successful in involving seniors in many different projects that help their local communities our vote to reauthorize the older

that the economy is improving moderatelyif you can believe the economic indicators issued this weekwe can now somehow miraculously allow our federal government to grow to the astronomical level of 715 billion it appears that the budget committee only listens to those that tell it what it wants to hearlistening to any faint voice that somehow will continue to justify the runaway growth of the

establishes the size and the growth rate for the federal government in thp years ahead it appears that the budget committee does not want to listen to president reagan the leader our country chose last november he wants to hold the federal government downlimit its growth with a budget of less than 689 billion it appears that the committee does not want to listen to the american peopleour constituents who have time and time again expressed themselves in favor of limiting the growth of the federal government well perhaps i can persuade my colleagues to listen to the voice of the future generation 19 years ago the federal budget was scarcely 100 billion who then would have believed that today the house budget co~mmittee would be seeking a 715 billion budget who would have been elected in support of such a budget 19 years hence well who today wants the budget in the year 2000 19 years away to surpass 2 860 billion if we allow the current budget committee proposal to pass and continue its level of growth even at what it calls these conservative levela then thats thh budget for the year 2000 2 860 billion i but if we adopt the presidents budget and escalate thi ough the year 2000 it the level of the 1982 proposal then the budget in the year 2000 will be less than half the federal budget woud become less than half if we allow the budget committee level to pass the

unemplo~ment reaching unprecedented levels since the great depression we came back for this lameduck session with a number of efforts to put our people back to work one effort is the bipartisan 5 billion highway jobs bill that we worked on and passed over here and which i voted for we did our jobs and now the senators are working the bill overand over that bill will create some 300 000 jobs the other was an effort by the joint economic committee to put together a second jobs bill under the able leadership of its chairman the gentleman from wisconsin whom we will all miss himself a distinguished economist i understand there were hearings with john kenneth galbraith walter heller former labor secretaries ray marshall and willard wirts federal reserve chairman paul volcker and others something happened to the reuss proposal the one that would have reduced deficits by 0 5 billion the first year rising to 7 billion the third year on the way to the forum the longawaited eagerly anticipated jobs bill you have before you is not the one drafted with the aid of renowned economists or former labor secretaries as i said in full committee last friday the jobs proposal you have before you was drafted with a magnet every program with a nut or bolt within 5 miles has been drawn into this bill the road to economic recovery in this proposal is in the tracks of a bulldozer we passed a 5 billion highway bill the other day and we have 250 million more in highway funds in this bill there is no rhyme nor reason we do not even know whether the states can afford to match the additional 250 million in highway funds let alone use it this is not a carefully planned billit is a christmas tree excepting defense the nine biggest appropriations subcommittees have gotten their plums in this proposal and the branches of the poor christmas tree are breaking there is 50 million in here for a program called the sba national resources development grants i hikve served on the small business committee for 24 years and i have never heard of that program do you know what it is supposed to do provide treeplanting services christmas trees i am sure our auto industry is in trouble no problem we will put in 100 million for the government to buy car whether it needs them or not well buy 15 000 cars and with the 100 million create 2 000 jobs at a cost of 50 000 per job this is a replay of the surplus milk situation right now we have warehouses overflowing with surplus milk and chcese with this bill we will have garages overflowing with surplus cars these programs are fantasies but things really take a serious turn when you look at the energy and water section that is where you really see the plums plums like an additional 145 million on top of the 236 mllion increase in corps of engineers funding already in the regular energy and water bill that additional money will speed construction of projects like the red river waterway a 1 7 billion barge canal on one of the most siltladen and unstable watercourses in the country a project faulted by both the gao and the army auditing agency a project that duplicates rail service already in existence and if you look at the corps 05 million in operation funds you will see it is going for projects that include the tennessee tombigbee a project you may have thought you would have a separate vote on today if you look ever further beyond the report buried in the bill tinder the heading other productive activities you will find a section providing as follows appropriations for the yatesville lake construction project shall be made available for obligation in the amount designated for that project in title ii of h r 7145 that is an 8 million earmark as far as i can deter mine for a project that would have reduced the 200 million damage from the twin 197778 flood of the big sandy river by 5 000 that would have reduced the worst flood in history by 2 5 inches and that according to the corps of engineers will operate in the red for its entire 100 year economic life as a recreational facility the total cost for that project by the way is estimated at 200 million in case you are wondering how many jobs per dollar you are creating take a look at bureau of reclamation operation and maintenance where you will be spending 21 million to create 434 jobsa cost of 49 000 per job at 49 000 a job the next thing you know those 434 workers will think they work for the house of representatives in case you are wondering what kind of jobs you will be funding let me point you to page 46 of the report which states that flood control funds will be used for increasing the stockpile of materials for revetment work which would include the ordering of additional reinforcement and other materials for any unemployed stock clerk out there take heart this jobs bill is coming to the rescue or look a little further down on page 46 where bureau of reclamation funds will be used for archeological studies and boundary fencing another major step in the rebuilding of amerlea somewhere on the way to the forum this jobs bill got hijacked and soaked in a pork barrela poik barrel that could not make it through the regular funding process i might add and in case you are taken by the notion that this bill is meant to create jobs to help the immediate problem of our 10 8 percent unemployment rate look closely at the bill language take the 489 million for military housing construction money for instance that money is to remain available for obligation through september 30 19875 years from now by supporting title ii of this bill you will be getting a foot up on unemployment all right unemployment in 1987 and that pattern is repeated through the bill 500 million in transportation programsto remain

expended 200 million for rural water and waste disposal grantsto remain available until expended 100 million for watershed and flood prevention operationsto remain available until expended do not let yoursel be kidded these programs are not designed to prime the pump to get us out of our current crisis these programs are not designed to put people to work today they are not even necessarily designed to put people to work tomorrow these are programs that will put people to work whenever the agencies get around to spending it whether the pump needs priming or not and that may be years from now this bill is being used as a vehicle a vehicle to provide extra funds to a number of programs that could not get those funds any other way and a vehicle to provide funds for a lot of projects that never would get funded any other way what is more it is doing it by using the guise of jobs creation as a free pass free from the scrutiny of hearings free from the scrutiny of individual examination and authorization and free from scrutiny as to cost effectiveness this bill is a grab bag pure and simple when i finally saw this eagerly anticipated jobs bill and took a look at the proposal list of 5 6 billion in appropriations and 1 1 billion in other obligations i could not believe my eyes i said to myself we owe the american people a lot more than this the problems of unemployment and business bankruptices are far too serious to insult the people with this grab bag of goodies we are throwing money around in this proposal like it was going out of style but just throwing money around will not make sure this 6 7 billion is used wisely to put as many people to work as possible and until we can be sure i think it would be very wise to refrain as much as any person in this room i am in favor of jobs and i am in favor of responsible action to assist those most in need at this time of 10 8 percent unemploymenit but we will not do anyone a favor by enacting this bill in its current

restraint and adequate support for the necessary and worthwhile research and service activities of noaa i want to note my admiration for the strong leadership of the gentleman from florida the chairman of the science and technology committee i would also like to commend the gentleman from kansas the ranking minority member of the committee for his support of our efforts i also am particularly indebted not only to my democratic colleagues on the subcommittee but also to the gentleman from new york for his tireless work in effecting a responsible and workable authorization bill for noaa in a truly bipartisan way we could not have had a more diligent and cooperative colleague as ranking minority member of the subcommittee the atmospheric climatic and ocean pollution act authorizes 498 543 000 for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to conduct essential research and service activities in a wide variety of areas including weather forecasting climatic services tornado and hurricane warnings aviation weather ocean dumping research and atmospheric research included in this authorization figure are 2 2 million for reauthorization of the national climate program act and 5 1 million for noaa to operate a land remote sensing system from space landsat this is a bill which is responsive to our recognition of this nations budgetary problemsthe authorization figure in the bill is 4 000 below the administrations request h r 2803 marks the beginning of a new relationship between congress and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa was established by executive reorganization in 1970 with the mission of providing services and research in the sea and in the air over the past 11 years numerous environmental statutes have given naa additional duties so that the agency is now responsible for weather forecasting acid rain research fisheries conservation the national sea grant program the national ocean pollution office the national climate office conservation of muxine mammals and sensitive marine habitats and many more programs which the congress and the american people have regarded as legitimate and important government services throughout these 11 years the congress has voted on numerous occasions to authorize noaa to carry out a proscribed environmental responsibility however we in the congress have never reviewed and evaluated the missions and programs of this important agency as a whole with the view of understanding how its components ought to relate to each other and to the needs of the people we on the committee on science and technology for instance feel strongly that the primary mission of noaas weather arm ought to be protection of the public health and safety through timely and accurate weather forecasts and warnings however in the heat of the appropriations process it is easy for members for those evaluating these services and for the weather service itself to lose sight of the absolute primacy of the publics health and safety in setting priorities for the weather service i am confident that consideration of a comprehensive authorization bill for noaa will provide members with a good opportunity to review and if necessary reorder the agencys priorities and that this process will help noaa to keep its programs in tune with the needs of the public h r 2803 is the first step in a process which i hope will culminate in an authorization bill for the entire agency the bill authorizes funding for approximately 500 million of the agencys 800 million budget including all of its weather climatic and oceanpollution activities the noaa activities not included in this billfisheries sea grant ocean thermal energy and hard minerals development are under the jurisdiction of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries and we on the committee on science anbd technology are confident that in future years the two committees will report to the house a comprehensive authorization bill for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in reporting h r 2803 the committee on science and technology increased funding above the administrations request for a limited number of noaa activities funding for these programs was increased either because they promise to provide needed informational services to policymakers or the public and they embody a critical transfer of research technology which will greatly enhance the usefulness of the service provided with respect to information services h r 2803 contains 500 000 for noaa to begin a comparative study of the environmental effects of waste disposal in various medialand sea and air there is increasing pressure to open up the ocean once again for disposal of wastes however because of the short sighted approach of federal agencies in the past crucial crossmedia comparisons of environmental impact have never been made so that the environmental protection agency must regulate waste disposal without an adequate understanding of what the relative impact of various disposal optionsl might be the committee feels that the most appropriate target for a pioneering study of this sort is the sewage sludge disposal problem in the new york city metropolitan area the bill also contains funding above the administrations request for upgrading the climatological data base at the national climatic center and for enhanced funding of the national climate program office both of these increases are based on the recommendations of the national academy of sciences the national climate offices 5year plan and our own committee that the greatest nearterm improve ment that can be made in our national climate effort would be to improve the accessibility and use of the data already available in government archives effective use of climatic data is an essential element in agricultural productivity and water management with regard to technology transfer h r 2803 includes enhanced funding for several projects which are expected to greatly improve the weather services ability to warn the public of severe weather the committee feels that the greatest challenge facing the weather service in the coming years will be in providing services particularly severeweather warnings in the face of stable or shrinking personnel levels thus in h r 2903 our committee strongly supported those projects which showed either promise for improving detection of severe weather or promise of automating routine functions a modest investment in capital equipment can produce substantial savings in labor and free up the time of skilled personnel in the weather service to perform important forecasting tasks we supported automation of field operations and services afos but agree with the committee on appripriations that a successful test of the system is needed before increased expenditures are warranted at this time funding was provided to accelerate design of the next generation radar nexrad system the weather service currently uses the outmoded and rapidly failing wsr57 radars built in the 1950s delay of nexrad would be a false savings in that it would lead to severely reduced service and to greatly increased maintenance costs additional funds were provided for testing and installing automated observing systems which will eventually be placed at over 500 airports to form the backbone of the groundbased observational network this program has the potential to free personnel to perform more critical forecast and service functions and any delay in this program would result in greatly reduced productivity finally the bill recommends enhanced funding for the national severe storms center in kansas city for its centralized storm information system csis csis allows the forecaster to integrate data from satellites radar and other observing systems at a finer scale than is presently possible and is recognized to be the most promising development in the detection of severe storms since the refinement of doppler radar in this bill the committee also strongly supported the administrations request of 1 876 000 for research in the sources and transport of acid rain this is a substantial increase from the 1981 appropriation for acid rain research which was under 100 000 acid rain is responsible for the biological sterility of hundreds of lakes in the northeastern united states and in canada and may fit the present time or in the near future be responsible for literally billions of dollars of damage to forests and to crops to metal and stone structures of all sorts and to human health in our hearings this year we had testimony that not only will the northeast and canada continue to be severely afflicted with the problems of acid rain absent a major intervention on our part but that also the west coast and the upper middle west are threatened with the poisonous problem of acid rain on their croplands on their forestlands on their waters and on their structures in the near future the administrations request for acid rain research was timely for several reasons including the importance of this issue to the clean air act reauthorization and the designation of noaa as a lead ageney in acid rain research by the energy security act of we have all observed from the newspapers that when president reagan visited canada shortly after he took office it was made very clear to him that acid rain was a matter of urgent concern to our canadian friends more recently i was a member of a group of american congressmen and senators who met with our canadian colleagues members of parliament and their environment minister in halifax and again it was made clear to us beyond a peradventure that the problem of acid rain and our contribution to their problem was a matter of most urgent concern to them so i congratulate president reagan and the administration for having requested a significant and timely increase in the budget to look into the question of acid rain in a comprehensive and holistic fashion i fully agree with the administration that we ought to know far more than we do now what will be the costs and benefits of our efforts to use inexpensive sources of fuel in terms of our environment and natural resources we should have information as to whether a given expenditure in scrubbing coal for instance will lead to a linear reduction of emissions and to improvements in the atmosphere and the fact is that today we do not know we need far more accurate information to make intelligent decisions from the point of view of cost and benefits when we pass legislation imposing major expenditures upon our utilities and upon our manufacturing industries this increase in the budget for acid rain research is totally consistent with this administrations concern that we make more thoughtful decisions affecting the regulatory process and it reflects also the presidents own experience in meeting with canadian leaders and the experience of this congress reflecting the very high priority that we put on a thoughtful logical and workable approach to reducing the problems of acid rain so i do congratulate the administration and the president and i congratulate my colleague the gentleman from new york for the role that he played in bringing them to this very intelligent and useful decision let me say a few words about section 4 of h r 2803 which provides noaa with 5 1 million to plan for develop and operate a civilian land observing system landsat in an era of resource scarcity our committee believes that the ability to obtain and interpret space remote sensing data and thus to locate and manage natural resources is of major importance our committee believes that a finite period of operation by the federal government would greatly mininize the technical financial and institutional risks involved in developing landsat would preserve our national leadership and ultimately would enable the private sector to operate a sound land remote sensing system in closing h r 2803 provides money for a large number of essential atmospheric and oceanic activities i urge my colleagues to support these programs and i recommend h r 2803 for immediate passage from the full house and again i commend my colleague the gentleman from new york for his highly professional and nonpartisan and thoughtful approach to this legislation and his support for it"], [0.9642729759216309, 0.9642729759216309, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i am pleased to join the distinguished chairman
