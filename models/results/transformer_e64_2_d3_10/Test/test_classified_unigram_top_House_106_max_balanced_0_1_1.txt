district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio programs historically black colleges and universities and community technology centers in an age of unprecedented wealth the cbc has the vision to invest in the american family and not squander opportunities afforded by a budget surplus i will not support the failed policies of the past senator mccain has best characterized this budget resolution as one that is fiscally irresponsible i

friends lets take a close look under the majoritys bill funding for critical education training employment and social service programs is either frozen or cut producing significant reductions in current service levels only special education is spared the sledgehammer for example by fiscal year 2005 40 000 fewer children would be able to participate in head start and 164 000 fewer lowincome families would be able to receive liheap assistance in just one year 316 000 fewer lowincome students would be able to receive pell grants and 310 000 fewer lowincome women infants and children would

reduction initiative would be cut leaving school districts with fewer resources to hire and train new teachers afterschool and summer programs established to help improve student achievement and reduce juvenile crime would be cut back undermining vital school reform efforts clearly this budget abandons those most in need of federal support it also fails to address important national

country which are in keeping with our national values in reviewing this bill that is before us today i am reminded of the story of someone who said how come so many good mathaticians come out of mit and the answer is because so many good mathematicians go into mit why is this a very bad bill because very bad budget considerations went into this bill this is a bad bill compared to the presidents budget it would cut 2 9 billion from education services cut 1 7 billion from labor with cuts to workforce development and safety investments and cut more than 1 billion from critical health programs this is a bad bill also because it eliminates and cuts services for americas senior citizens and their families and why why are we forced to vote on this bad bill we are forced to vote on this bad bill because republican house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations the result was a republicandesigned budget resolution that was so bad that even the republican chairman of this subcommittee opposed it and soon we will be voting on a measure to repeal the estate tax within 24 hours we will be cutting education and we will be repealing

colleagues to oppose it the first problem with this gop bill is that it severely shortchanges education by 3 5 billion this bill would end our commitment to hire 100 000 new teachers and to reduce class sizes i am concerned by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited english proficiency these funds support the training and

a major issue for my constituents in el paso as i know that it is for many of you in your home districts in el paso and in other areas along the unitedstates mexico border nafta has created many displaced workers and this bill does an injustice to programs that could help them for example the bill cuts assistance to over 215 000 dislocated workers and it cuts the dislocated worker program by 207 million below the 2000 level these cuts will make it more difficult for these workers to find jobs this bill also cuts adult job training for almost 40 000 adults the cuts in adult training programs equal 93 million or 10 percent below the request and 2000 levels finally this bill provides only 9 6 million for employment assistance to another class of displaced workers our homeless veterans there are over a quarter million homeless veterans in this country and the provisions in this bill will deny employment assistance to thousands of these americans who have faithfully served

evening and that is the need for hmo reform and the need to bring legislation to the floor of thishouse which we refer to as the patients bill of rights because it provides protection for americans who are patients who happen to be members of hmos or managed care organizations and those protections are needed right now they were needed a long time ago but it is really time that the republican leadership of the house of representatives allow this bill to come to the floor to be debated and i believe it will pass overwhelmingly i must say i have been on this floor many times over the last year or even beyond asking that the republican leadership allow the opportunity for the patients bill of rights to come to the floor and we were told last friday for the first time that the speaker has set the week of october 4 approximately 2 weeks from now for that opportunity although i have to say that i am suspicious of the way that this will be brought to the floor and the procedure and the rules that will be followed and i know that my colleague the gentleman from iowa mentioned that as well i must say that i am pleased that we will be debating hmo reform and that one of the bills that we have been promised by the speaker that will be brought to the floor is the patients bill of rights i really need to emphasize this evening as i have so many other times on the floor and this well that there are differences between the various managed care reform proposals that have been proposed here and that even though it is true that the republican leadership now says that they will allow debate on the patients bill of rights they have also made it quite clear that they are going to favor bills other than the patients bill of rights and that there may and certainly will be an effort to pass alternative legislation to the patients bill of rights i need to urge my colleagues not to fall into the trap of thinking that anything other than the new bipartisan patients bill of rights is acceptable not only to us but to the american people i wanted to point out that it has been very interesting really just last wednesday i guess september 13 in the new york times there was an article that talked about how the gop leadership was very cool on our patients rights plan and how they were sort of scouring and looking at all kinds of ways of avoiding passage of the patients bill of rights and i just wanted to if i could either summarize or read through some of the interesting aspects of this article because as we know back in august just before the summer break in the first part of august this was on august 6 just before we left for the summer recess at that point the speaker indicated that he was going to allow a republican group a group of republicans to put together a bill that he and the republican leadership would find acceptable in terms of hmo reform there was no question in my mind that this was a bill this was an effort by the republican leadership to essentially bypass or kill the bipartisan patients bill of rights that had been drafted by my colleague the gentleman from georgia the gentleman from michigan who has long been an advocate and who formulated the original patients bill of rights the gentleman from iowa myself and others who had basically come up with a bipartisan patients bill of rights that would have achieved real hmo reform at the time on august 6 the speaker said well i am not in favor of that bill the patients bill of rights but i will let the gentleman from oklahoma and a few other members of congress on the

that eventually this will see the beginning of a resolution that really deals with communitybased efforts i rise this morning to strike the language that limits the use of funding of federal transportation dollars for the planning design or construction of a light rail system in houston texas this is an effort to speak on this floor and to ask for collaborative support on communitybased efforts dealing with the great needs of regional mobility in an area that is working to comply with clean air requirements as a representative of the aiea that would see the benefits of this light rail project and as a representative from houston that would see the larger benefits i want this floor to know that this is a collective and collaborative effort houston metro simply wants to transfer 65 million in federal funds earmarked for construction of a light rail project in my home city of houston the rest of the monies would come from other local sources what better collaborative federallocal government collaboration than to see the matching funds the effort that the community is making the light rail project has been vetted extensively in our community it has been vetted by the metro board the city council the mayor of houston who is of course a supporter i have received support from the local surrounding congressional members the gentlemen from texas mr green mr lampson mr doggetr and mr turner the mayor of the city of houston the county judge of the city of houston the houston partnership the medical center the astrodome area of which this connector would connect if we just envision a straight line going through a myriad of areas in a city some high some low this light rail connector is in fact a dream effort to ensure a working laboratory to give further data and insight into the idea oirregional mobility it connects the large astrodome where the republican national convention was held along through some depressed areas along through our museum area the rice university main h3438 coi street as most of our towns have their main street which have fallen upon hard times then into our vibrant downtown area and connecting the university of houston downtown that serves a high population of hispanics and african americans this light rail is a win win circumstance it is a system that has been frugal in its analysis no comment or criticism has come from the department of transportation that this is not a good system no criticism has come that they are overrun with the new executive director and ceo of the metro shirley delibero we brought in a very fine rail professional we know for sure that this rail system will help to generate feeder lines if the community so desires in parts west north south and east reaching to all parts of this metroplex as we have seen the proposal of the light rail we have seen a light come into the area we have seen the beginning of a 27story highrise office building we have seen the work of trammell crow residential which is evaluating from 250 unit multiservice or multifamily housing complex in midtown houston we have seen camden development complete a 337unit apartment project in midtown and mccord development which has two highrise office redevelopment projects underway frankly what i am hoping that as we evidence to this body both democrats and republicans alike although this does not rise to the level of a point of order it is a limitation we ask that this body give respect and credence to a collective group of individuals who have sought only to see a return on their tax dollars and to match the work that has gone on in washington d c that has moved people from place to place seattle washington our sister city dallas texas and many other parts of this nation that have had rail and have seen the pollution come down and people being moved efficiently this city is seeking to have their olympics in 2012 and i know by saying that i might rise the ire of some of the other competing cities but we are working very hard to bring that olympics to the united states of course and certainly to texas and certainly to houston this is a real key component to doing that an economic engine and i do believe that those who may find fault with what has happened in the past in 1991 will come to the realization that they can find no fault in what is going on right now there have been meetings and hearings and there are stakeholders and people are concerned i would ask my colleagues to consider this as we proceed i would have liked to see this amendment come to the end i intend at the conclusion of the debate to withdraw this amendment because i am hoping that we can enter into an abbreviated colloquy to say that we will work together i see the gentleman from texas on the floor of the house i want to work with him but i do want us as a community to be able to move into the 21st century i look forward to my colleagues working with me and the gentleman from texas on this very important issue i rise with my colleague mr bentsen to offer an amendment to section 331 of this bill h r 4475 that would only prevent funding for the planning design or construction of a community supported light rail system in houston texas as a representative for the 18th congressional district in houston i fully support the transit funding that was appropriated for houston and approved by the department of transportation for the light rail project the houston metro was to transfer 65 million in federal funds earmarked for construction of a light rail project in my home city of houston the rest of the 235 million needed would come from local funds slated to build park and ride centers and other projects the light rail project is supported by the houston metro the surrounding congressional districts of congressmen bentsen who is a cosponsor of this amendment gene green lampson doggett and turner the business community the mayor of houston lee p brown and the harris county presiding elected official judge robert eckels this light rail project is a winwin situation for everyone in houston as well as the millions of people who visit every year in that it would attract and focus new development and an economic boom around the station areas and to the economically depressed areas within the city of houston and the 18th congressional district which i represent in fact an independent overview written by the greater houston partnership which includes the houston chamber of commerce houston economic development organization and houston world trade stated that the economic impact of the light rail project in houston would have an estimated incremental development over the 20012020 period ranging from 0 percent to 40 percent the light rail project would also reinvigorate retail sales in downtown houston as well as link the two principal employment centers of houston which is made up of 200 000 employees some of the local businesses that began to plan for the economic boom that the light rail project would bring are century development which started plans to build a 27story high rise office building with a 1 500 space parking garage and 50 000 square feet of retail space trammel crow residential which is evaluating two 250300 unit multifamily housing complex in midtown houston camden development which recently completed a 337 unit apartment project in midtown and mccord development which has two 2 highrise office redevelopment projects underway totaling over 50 million in renovation fees these are only some of the redevelopment that is being implemented as a result of the light rail project in houston which was to receive federal funding houston has also been hit with major concerns about air quality and requirements for improving its air quality through better mobility plans therefore the light rail project for houston is of urgent need to the community the main street light project is welcomed by the residents of houston light rail will help alleviate houstons traffic congestion problem and significantly reduce the number of motorists that presently pollute the air with exhaust the light rail project will play a pivotal role in regional transportation among other benefits the light rail project will service all day transit demand including peak hours it will relieve bus congestion in the urban core as buses from throughout the region currently converge on downtown this project will offer a transportation choice to many area residents who will choose to leave their vehicles at home i will be absolutely

rise in opposition to the amendment i have to apologize to our colleagues that we are taking up the time of the house for something that should be settled in houston texas but i rise and feel the need to rise to explain what is going on here i have been involved in mobility around houston for 20 years i have been involved in the regional mobility plan and in developing that plan in the 1980s that we are now finishing i am very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build this system in houston should be decided by the whole community as things stand today houstonians cannot make an informed decision because metro does not have a comprehensive light rail system to take

called diabetes the epidemic of our time the impact diabetes has on the health of our population on the national budget is staggering every year diabetes causes about 24 000 more people to lose their sight 28 000 more people to undergo dialysis or transplantation for kidney failure and 77 000 more people to lose their lives from heart disease these diabetesrelated side effects in combination shorten life expectancy by an estimated 15 years in the year 1999 approximately 800 000 people will be diagnosed with diabetes and the disease will contribute to almost 200 000 deaths in the united states the number of americans with diabetes has increased nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years again a primary reason that the cdc has called it the epidemic of our time the public and private costs of diabetes are enormous an estimated 105 billion annually including over 40 billion a year in federal dollars more then 1 out of every 10 health care dollars in the unitedstates and about 1 out of 4 medicare dollars is spent on diabetes care in new york state almost 600 000 people and 10 of our seniors have been diagnosed with diabetes at an annual public and private cost of about 8 billion diabetes kills one american every 3 minutes and a new case of diabetes is diagnosed in the united states every 40 seconds and unfortunately an estimated 52 million americans have diabetes right now and do not even know it but new research is filled with promise the diabetes research working group created by congress in 1997 has developed a comprehensive plan for future research that would cost 827 million next year congress mandated this study congress has received its mandated report and yet last year we gave 448 million about half of what is called for only 3 percent of the total nih budget for diabetes that is simply 28 per patient that is not enough yet every day research and new technologies are improving diabetes diagnosis and treatment for example current diagnostic methods cannot always detect adult onset diabetes at the earliest stage of the disease but a new technology has been developed that will diagnose adult onset diabetes as much as 5 years earlier than any current method by scanning the eye retina with low intensity florescent light an early diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications we need to increase research for diagnosis blood testing is also becoming less obtrusive a continuous glucose monitoring system recently approved by the fda continuously and automatically monitors glucose levels underneath the skin future generations of this device may permit the patient to monitor blood levels and connect to an insulin pump for seamless care a glucowatch a device worn like a wristwatch will test blood levels easily and painlessly this device which is pending fda approval is as successful at blood testing as conventional methods that require pricking the finger multiple times every day and causes only a slight tingling sensation we need to increase research for blood monitoring we also must increase research for treatment for example we are at the brink of developing an ability to inhale insulin rather than inject it into the body multiple times per day another burden for people with diabetes is the need to inject themselves with insulin several new drugs taken orally may reduce the need to take insulin injections one class of drugs called insulin sensitizers helps to lower blood glucose primarily by reducing insulin resistance in muscles other groups of drugs work by suppressing glucose production from the liver increasing insulin production by the pancreas or decreasing sugar absorption from the intestine for those who will still need insulin a power is being developed that can be inhaled so that injections might not be necessary we need to increase research for treatment in juvenile diabetes type 1 insulinroducing cells called islets are destroyed making daily insulin injections necessary the juvenile diabetes foundation jdf has established three centers for islet transportation which will attempt to transplant healthy islets to cure juvenile diabetes and find new ways to prevent transplant rejection and other dangerous sideeffects the nih and the jdf are also developing new ways to manipulate the immune system by inhibiting harmful immune responses while keeping protective ones intact we need to increase research for cures ultimately genetics may hold the key to a cure the american diabetes association has initiated the genetics of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus gennid study in order to maximize the rapid identification of the gene or genes involved in adultonset diabetes this study has established a national database and cellbank to store information and specimens from families with long histories of the disease the human genome project which is currently mapping the entire human genetic structure may also provide significant clues to

call that over 6 million young people answered last year in 4h clubs and organizations across the nation are they into it is the mantra repeated by over a half a million volunteers who donate an average of 200 per year to keep the 4h clubs strong and vital in their communities are they into it is the question answered by private sector partners of 4h who invest almost 100 million into 4h youth development programs i am glad to say that today this body is into it and i thank the gentleman from georgia for bringing this resolution forward today i am very pleased and proud to be on the floor supporting this important measure introduced by the gentleman from georgia many people believe we live in an era of unprecedented cynicism and skepticism that is why it is important for this congress to take a little time to recognize the outstanding organization like 4h which brings young people together to do good for their communities and to grow as principled individuals in fact research indicates that volunteerism among young americans has actually been on the increase americas youth want to participate in the betterment of their communities and their country the 4h is uniquely established to provide opportunity to young people nationwide to learn valuable life skills work with others toward common goals and developing into community leaders the 4h is a dynamic organization whose mission is to foster innovation and shared learning for americas youth ages 6 to 19 its vision is to draw upon combined power of youth and adults so that we can learn together in order to address the challenges and opportunities critical to youth in our communities 4h stresses three fundamental values first we must treat others with mutual trust and respect and open and honest communication second we must assume personal leadership and responsibility for our actions and third we must celebrate our differences as well as our similarities and always realize that working with youth as partners is the key to our success last week i met with several young people from my district from western wisconsin who are in washington on different trips two of whom were here for the conference voices against violence and one was here with the national young leadership conference which uses the 4h facilities here in washington for mock government sessions throughout the year what i found striking about these young people is their commitment to their communities and whether consciously or unconsciously to the values and ideals fostered by the 4h andy slind of boyceville wisconsin told me he plans to continue working in his community during the last 2 years of his high school and would work to participate in some form of public service after college our young people know they have a stake in their communities and want to help shape their futures 4h provides opportunities for such involvement and it hones the values and skills we all cherish as americans i am grateful for the opportunity to commemorate the 4h today for personal reasons as well i am a former 4h club member myself when i was a boy growing up in western wisconsin i loved and appreciated the time that i spent within my 4h club 4h continues to play a central role in communities like mine in fact just on saturday my local paper carried an article describing a man who was being honored for his dedication to 4h bob fredrick of viroqua wisconsin has been a 4h youth development agent for 40 years he started in 1957 at the age of 25 and decided to make the youth program his sole career in honor of bobs lifelong dedication to vernon county youth the community is establishing a special fund for youth programs in his name as i mentioned earlier over 6 million young people were involved in 4h programs last year in fact nationwide 1 in 7 americans have been involved in 4h at some point during their lives in fact in addition to myself three of my staffers here in washington were 4h members in their youth and i would venture to guess that many others around capitol hill have experience with a 4h club 4h was founded in 1902 and established in my home state of wisconsin in 1914 there are currently over 2 000 4h clubs in my state alone and almost 190 000 young people from wisconsin that belong to 4h clubs wisconsin was proud to host the national 4h dairy conference this last september which drew over 250 young people from around the united states and canada to learn about new technologies and techniques in dairy farming while many people associate 4h with rural communities and agricultural issues kids from cities and suburbs from all backgrounds belong to 4h clubs through 4h they study citizenship and civics communications and arts consumer and family issues

gentleman from missouri the subcommittee member the gentleman from michigan"], [0.001050710678100586, 0.5010507106781006, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i am pleased to join the gentleman from florida the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations in bringing this foreign operations bill to the floor we have debated this extensively in the course of the congress working its will on the bill in the initial bill and the conference report and lots of debates surrounding how this bill is coming to the floor it is indeed a compromise yes there is additional funding and that was agreed to between the majority and minority parties helping to meet some of the presidents initiatives i am very pleased that through the process we were able to bring a very robust wye river agreement to the floor and know that it will receive overwhelming support from our colleagues as i said this bill has been extensively debated in the interest of time i just want to say two things one is that this bill is about threat reduction it is in the interest of every person in our country and indeed in the interest of our great country for us to reduce threat that is manifested in this legislation in funds to disarm the nuclear weapons in russia that reduces threat of those weapons in the world and to our people stopping proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is in our interest threat reduction though applies also to the environment funds spent on international environmental issues reduce environmental and pollution threats to people in our own country funds spent on child survival for stopping disease and trying to eliminate disease in the world is in the interest not only of the children of the world but is a threat reduction to the children of america i believe that america should have a very strong leadership role in the world most people agree i think but even if one does not i think one will agree that it is in the national selfinterest and the personal selfinterest of every person in our country to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons the threat of environmental pollution the threat of disease and other threat that can harm our country and our people i have had a chart on occasion that shows a very thin sliver of the budget pie which is this appropriations bill it looks like a little needle it is so thin it is just a little line i think my colleagues should consider that needle that portion of the budget that is spent on foreign operations as the needle of inoculation inoculation against the spread of warfare the spread of disease the spread of pollution as i said that list goes on so it is a small price for us to pay to protect our people to prevent a conflict and to help america assume its role in the world in addition to threat reduction i will talk a moment about debt reduction which is also in this package though not as robustly as i would like to see in terms of debt reduction this is the jubilee year i would hope that in the package which is here which only addresses bilateral debt reduction but i am hoping that we will have language in the bill that frees us from the paris club minutes that tie that debt reduction to criteria established by the imf but instead tie it to criteria established by this congress that we will proceed in the next year to move on to multilateral debt reduction which is very important the year 2000 is a jubilee year a year where interfaith organizations in a very ecumenical movement have come together to call for debt forgiveness at the end of the century and even more so at the end of the millennium it has been a biblical tradition to forgive hopefully we can forgive the debt many of these countries are burdened by by previous corrupt regimes but now that these democracies have emerged they cannot be harnessed or hampered by the debts of the previous regimes or even by some inappropriate economic policies of their predecessors so in the interest of threat reduction and in the interest of debt reduction i am pleased that we have this compromise package which will help prevent some of the ills that i mentioned earlier and promote democratic values throughout the world grow our economy through promoting our exports and have freer and fairer trade in the world as we open markets but we must help create those markets debt reduction will help do that i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0012304186820983887, 0.4987695813179016, 1, "i yield 1 minute to myself we keep having a red herring dragged across the path of this debate the principal budgeting contention on the floor the alternative to their budget is our budget and it commits 100 percent to social security is backed up by a statute which requires the treasurer to take a certain percentage of payroll taxes to buy down public debt the general public probably does not understand but points of order are honored in the breach on the house floor we have a committee on rules upstairs which specializes in overriding points of order it is a joke to say that a point of order provides any protection whatsoever i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from

minutes i am pleased to support the drug dealer liability act and i commend its author my colleague the gentleman from iowa h r 1042 would subject individuals who participate in illegal drug activity

entire communities they kill our children 0 1545 the criminal justice system is giving the drug problem its primary attention its counterpart the civil justice system should be brought into the fight

with their illegal activity including the costs of medical treatment or drug rehabilitation taxpayers currently bear most of that burden that is not the way it should be this legislation gives us
