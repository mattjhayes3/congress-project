at a commemoration a memorial tribute to one of the great people of the house sala burton basically what i said was that to me sala burton had the glamour of a marlene deitrich and the heart and good will of a mother teresa and the political savvy of a golda meir if anyone read the congressio al record when my distin guished colleague mr edwards dean of the california delegation introduced the privilege resolution they would know the overwhelming expression of grief and love for sala she was really a mother a sister and a friend to all of us she cared in a very special way for people she really did love her roots her family her country the congress and she had a real affectionthose callfornians stick togetherfor the california delegation she certainly loved san francisco she was extremely proud to represent and it was americas perfect city with its great diversity of people she meant very very much to the wives of the members of course she was the cofounder of the congressional wives task force and always reached out to make them feel a part of congress sala often told me of the pride and love she had for her daughter and her soninlaw and her grandchildren she admired her daughters abilities and independence her parents meant very very much to her her mother still is living god bless her and she had a marvelous impression from her parents she often talked about her fathers brilliance and her mothers common sense and their interest in current affairs she was very proud of her brotherinlaw john and believed he had tremendous values as did her husband and values that are known in california indeed nationally as the great burton tradition she was proud of johns personal courage as well and proud of her brotherinlaw bob as well she was very very proud of her brother and her nephew tom who was so gracious to so many of us during salas illness i want to say this about her staff she felt that they were an extended part of her family and they ought to know how much affection sala had for them and how much it meant to her that they carried on during her illness so in a very special way all of us can claim sala in a very real way of course she loved her beloved phillip as she would say you could not talk to her for any length of time without knowing of the respect and love she had for her husband she quoted him often she felt even after he died that she was an extension of him but sala in her own right was a magnificent congresswoman and a very savvy politician she was intensely political and long before she became a congresswoman she served her political apprenticeship she traced her interest to her childhood in prewar poland she said i saw and felt what happened n western europe when the nazis were moving you learn politics is everybodys business she had instant clout in the house when we look at her assignments we see that she was practically hmmedlately after a term of being here assigned to the prestigious committee the committee on rules she was a delegate to the north atlantic assembly where 60 parliamentarians from nato elected her vice chair of the political committee last spring in luxembourg i saw her chair the committee and i saw the love and esteem of our allies and our fellow and sister parliamentarians who really thought that she was so outstanding she knew how to get things done one can recall the many instances in which sala did in fact buttonhole her friends i said in san francisco that she buttonholed the men in congress by flicking the lint from their lapels rather than twisting their arms her style was different from phils to say the least but it was equally as effective so how do we accept her death one of the things that sala was most proud of really was her jewish background so i quoted from the mourners kaddish in which there are a line or two that indicate that thru the long centuries and this is a quote from that beautiful prayer thru the long centuries we have learned to rise in the face of every storm out of the abyss of anguish on the ashes of every destruction to praise gods name to maintain a stance of human dignity and to affirm our consecration to the task of life that was her goal life was so important to her and she was consecrated to this the wednesday before salas death i had the great privilege of visiting her along with senator alan cranston and my friend and colleague the gentleman from california don edwands and at the end i whispered a few words to sala and she said to me and the last words she said to me were tell everyone i think of them and love them and she said goodbye mary rosewell talk which was a common expression of saas we will talk about salafor we will think of her legacy and her values that wonderful burton tradition we know that already there have been a number of things that people are proposing to name after her such as the sala burton maritime museum which of course was part of her legislation to have that funded properly and the gentleman from arizona mr mo udall did change the name in the legislation naming it after her one of the things that i would like to suggest i have introduced a bill that would allow the staff and people who work on the hill to have access to a daycare center and that has been passed i think that it would really be an honor for me to know that my legislation somehowand the gentlewoman from colorado mrs pat schroeder is the one who suggested it and i think it is a great ideato somehow dedicate that daycare center to the memory of our friend sala burton so we accept her death in the sense of alfred lord tennyson when he recalled in his wonderful poem in memoriam when he had the death of one of his dear friends thrust upon him and he was wondering how he could accept this great tragedy one of the lines that he uttered then and which is recorded for all of us immortally is something that consoles me very much when i think of her and that is ris better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all we all loved sala burton and we will talk to her many many times"], [0.0017849206924438477, 0.9982150793075562, 1, "i rise today well known for his stories as he isfor the

would cost 245 and to bring cash only i would have to bring someone with me to drive home after the abortion at the doctors office i was led to a room and left alone for ten minutes two medical personnel came in and one of them estimated that i was about three months along i was given a free one month supply of birth control pills and they asked me why i wanted the abortion i answered that i had just moved to maine from arkansas and i felt alone i also thought that it would hurt my parents to know i began to cry i was handed a form to sign i do not recall any of the questions or statements only that i was agreeing to the abortion i was given a shot of valium and was told that the suction method would used causing some discomfort during the abortion i remember wanting to sit up because i was having severe stomach cramps but one of the assistants held my shoulders down i remember that the one who was performing the abortion said its all over with and left the room the

safety improved if persons from virginia and maryland are hired as police firefighters and teachers by our local government before addressing the many myths put forth by the proponents of this amendment i wish to share with my colleagues a bit of background about the d c residency law the district of colunbia like many other state and local governments enacted in 1980 a law requiring that new employees of the government must move into the district within a reasonable period of time in order to work here a person do s not have to live in washington dc to get a job here but if a person chooses to work for the district government that person must become a district resi lent persons who were employed by the district prior to enpctment of the law are grandfathered that is they are not required to become residents and once a person is employed that person has up to 180 days to move into the district tie law is more than reasonable and is being updated constantly for example there is proposed legislatlon to amend tei law lo provide for an exemption from the residency requirement for narried couples the residency rcquirement according to wellestablished law through a string of cases in federal and state courts over the past half ceatury is a reasonable and rational local legislative option moreover there is widespread useof residency laws approximately 70 percent of cithis with populations of 250 000 or more have some form of residency la let me now deal with the myths that have been asserted by those who seek to elininate the districts residency law our colleague mr parris has stated tie district keep s lowering the requirements and the training standards 1 0 until they get enough bodies in addition the educational requirements have been eroded that is a myth it is misinformation the reality is that hiring standards for police officers are as high or higher than they were prior to enactment of the residency law before the law there was an 80item test today there is a 100item test and the number of applicants who pass now is only slightly higher than the number who passed prior to 1980 and with regard to the training program before the law the police academy consumed 17 weeks today the training program extends over a 22 week period i would suggest to the opponents of the d c residency law that if district residents are not qualified to be police officers and firefighters why is it that surrounding jurisdictions have an aggressive campaign to recruit them for comparable positions in their governments offering in some instances attractive incentives referring to the applicant pool for various d c law enforcement and public safety positions mr paarys has stated if they cannot find anybody to take the job they just exempt them from the residency requirement 9 0 that is a myth the realily is that for police and firefighters over the past 5 years i he district has had at least 10 applicants for every available position mr paiwis has further stated 0 there are 300 different categories of exeml tlons of people who are already exempeh from tle residency requirement that too is a myth ti reality is that there are only four categories of exemptions allowed by the d c residency law and each is very reasonable among the categories of exemptions is one for hardtofill positions a very common exemption anld one for positions in facilities outside the boundaries of washincton dc eighly percent of the exempted persons and 90 percent of the exempt ed positions are for jobs in district facilitles located in virginia or maryland

of this amendment wont more the writer cicero would ask to whose profit the reality is that this attemptedl job grab by proponents of this amendmient wholly overlooks the fact that the district has the highest unernployment rate among all jurisdictions in the washington metropolitan area the districts unemployment rate is twice that of prince georges and montgomery counties and three times that of fairfax county prince georges county has seven times more residents working for the d c govern mejnt than there are d c residents working for the prince georges county government in 1987 538 million was paid in wages from the district government to maryland residents while 118 million was paid to virginia residents this matter of residency is a breadandbutter issue going to the very heart of the districts economic base the amendment proposed puts at risk some 14 000 jobs and 300 million in additional income and indirect spending the impact would be staggering the consequences severe given that kind of drain on the economy the district might not be able to pay for police officers firefighters and other govefnment employees the issue is comnplex the solution proposed is not only simplistic but it is patently unfair already 00 percent of the money earned in washington dc takcsi flight to surrounding jurisdictions at the close of every workday six out of every ten dollars in

residents but they are not shouldered with the burden of paying taxes for those benefits if these commuteri ii 7i753 paid taxes here the district of columbia would realize close to 1 billion in additional revenue the people of washington dc are not unlike people everywhere they work hard pay their taxes and meet their requirements as citizens the residency requirement is a local issue

that is the tradition of public service giving of oneself in the service of the public good dan daniel has done that all of his life in a very special kind of way in all of the years that i knew him

general secretary of the soviet communist party to promote significant reforms in the politics economy and society of his country this commission report is designed to contribute to that consistent pressure placed upon soviet officials in the words of yuri orlov to back their liberal words with more action and to expand their reforms in accordance with international human rights agreements they themselves have signed in describing how much has changed or seems to be in the process of changing the report also documents how many fundamental rights of soviet citizens to freedom of expression of belief of movement and of national character remain restricted and unprotected this report by the helsinki commission is the culmination of many months of hard work i want to thank the cochairman of the commission senator dennis deconcini for the enormous amount of personal commitment he has dedicated to the commission in fulfilling its mandate his leadership within the senate on the importance of human rights has been demonstrated many times throughout his career and most recently during the debate on ratification of the inf treaty senator deconcinis message arms reductions and human rights must be pursued with equal vigor as chairman of the commission i want to extend equal appreciation to the commissions ranking minority members senator alfonse damato and representative don ritter as the commissions chairman during the 99th congress senator damato demonstrated a strong commitment to maintaining the bipartisan and recognized expertise of the commission in fulfilling its legislative mandate it was an honor to serve with him and i want to thank him for the many years of dedication to the issue of human rights representative don rittr who just returned from a commission trip to poland in early april has shown a relentless commitment in the human rights field he has served on the commission for 7 years and throughout has demonstrated the need to remind the world of the daily abuses suffered by thousands throughout i thank my colleagues not only because they have made the work of the commission easier through their contributions on a daily basis but because this report which each of them contributed to is a reflection of the bipartisan nature of a joint body that seeks to emphasize the critical importance of human rights and of holding all nations including our own accountable for their actions in this area the commission believes that as we look around today human rights abuses are continuing in frequency and increasing in variety with all of the attendant tragic and brutal consequences what is clear to the commission is that if the abuses are to be arrested it will take political will commitment and action by governments in our letter of transmittal to congress we state that there has been much to applaud in the three years of gorbachevs rule especially compared to the repressive actions of his predecessors the release of many political prisoners from camps and psychiatric prisonhospitals the rise in the numbers of soviet citizens permitted to emigrate and to travel the increasing candor of the official soviet press and the increasing tolerance shown to unofficial groups and unorthodox points of view are all welcome steps in the 113454 right direction they are however no more than first steps and as our report documents they were taken slowly and could be retracted almost overnight until the rule of law establishes a balance between the power of the soviet state and the human dignity of individual soviet citizens the latter will always be at risk if mikhail gorbachev cannot answer the cry to secure the liberty he says his people need to rebuild their society their economy their initiatitive and their selfconfidence he will be just another russian reformer remembered more for his proclaimed intentions than his actual achievements because we are certain that his innovations cannot take root without a foundation of assured justice we have titled this report on the gorbachev record reform and human rights the two must go together after three years of gorbachevs rule however that essential connection has yet to be made and maintained i urge my colleagues to read the commissions report it is very timely as we debate the inf treaty and discuss those elements that comprise our national security and as we approach the upcoming united statessoviet summit scheduled to begin may 29 in moscow human rights is a priority for the unitedstates congress it must be addressed every day at every level and at every

1987 i am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation and i want to take this time to thank chairman joe gaydos for hearing my concerns with h r 162 and for incorporating many of those concerns in the legislation before us here today i want to limit my comments today to the notification process created in h r 162 because it has been the subject of a great deal of debate and misunderstanding i believe it is important to have a mechanism to identify and notify those workers who are truly at high risk of occupational disease and let me add that chairman gaydos has done an outstanding job of formulating a balanced approach to insure that the bill we have before us today is far different from the one that was introduced earlier this year chairman gaydos and his staff have worked with representatives of both the business community and organized labor to insure that the bill is scientifically defensible workable and fairan approach i proposed last year the risk assessment board created in this legislation will have a difficult task to perform it must balance the basic mandate of this actthat of early notification of workers who face possible occupational disease because of exposures at workwith the conservative nature of epidemiologythe science upon which the determination to notify a group of workers is to be made failure to balance these factors will produce undesirable results if the board demands incontrovertible proof of cause and effect on a 1to1 basis workers will not be adequately forewarned of the risk of disease they face on the other hand if the board does not require a rigorous scientific review of the evidence presented to it to insure adherence to established scientific principles notifications may be sent out that are not justified epidemiology is the statistical science that attempts to associate a reported health effect with a cause the detective work that goes into such efforts is quite complicated and can sometimes produce results which do not bear out under further scrutiny the classic example is the work performed in london in the 1830s to track down the cause of the cholera epidemic early scientific work pointed out that people who lived at higher altitudes in london were less likely to get cholera and the scientific principle put forward that bad air quality at lower altitudes in the city led to increased cholera further work revealed however that the real culprit was water from the thames which was carrying the disease through the lowlying areas of london there are many modern equivalents of this example agent orange provides another example of the limits of epidemiology veterans have long suspected a link between various health effects including cancer and exposure to the defoliant agent orange during service in vietnam science has been unable to confirm that linkage however most recently the office of technology assessment concluded that such a linkage can probably never be shown since exposure information is insufficient there is not enough data from vietnam to estimate the levels of exposure to agent orange nor are biological tests run on veterans today likely to indicate the degree of past exposure because of the length of time that has elapsed exposure to the chemical toleune was intitially implicated in cases of cancer arising from workplace exposure upon further investigation however it became clear that the toleune itself was not responsible but certain grades of toleune that were contaminated by benzene i am raising these points not to protest this legislation but to emphasize the complicated nature of the issue before us there are no easy answers or triggers for action in this area i believe the legislation as currently drafted recognizes the complications in requiring the board to undertake a thorough scientific review and to require evidence of exposure to the agents at levels of concern before making a determination that a notice should be sent carried out properly the bill will help save lives but will do it in a way that is based in science not politics we can take no action here todayor we can err on the side of action and insure that workers will be notified of risks in their workplace this legislation because it is soundly designed will insure that only those at risk will be notified but that all those at risk will receive that notification i join with many here today to congratulate chairman gaydos for his good work and to urge passage of this important legislation what is the basis for the finding of the risk board that a group of employees is a population at risk is a finding of statistical significance in an epidemiological study sufficient to trigger a finding by the board"], [0.0009916424751281738,
