speaker and my colleagues and those who are watching this memorial sala burton served in this house for 3 years her husband served for close to two decades if you look at that statistic alone it does not really tell you the reality of the contributions of both phil and sala because they both served together during all those years they worked together collaborating together in the mutual objectives that they shared politically they both cared deeply about the role that government could play to help the disadvantaged the dispossessed to try to bring about social and economic justice they cared about the working people and the ability of those people to organize collectively to fight for their rights they always saw the people who were struggling who were having a tough time as the ones who needed their help most they cared about protecting the environment and they cared very deeply about this nation of ours sala burton was a refugee from poland she and her immediate family survived the nazi holocaust in europe those in the immediate family that did not come to this country were all lost in the crematoria of hitlers death camps that fact probably more than any other impressed upon sala the deep commitment to protecting civil liberties civil rights understanding that minority groups that might be discriminated against one day could be hated the next and uncontrolled discrimination and hatred can lead to such enormous evil that she knew we had to act before these kinds of things got out of hand on a personal note i have known sala and phil for close to 30 years when i was a young teenager and belonged to the young democrats in california phil and sai would talk to us when most grownup politicians were not spending any time with the kids about why politics was a noble thing to be involved in why the fights that we were fighting were often so frustrating were important and that we could make a contribution and that we had to keep on trying to make things better when my family and i came to washington the door was always open to us at the burton home 01450 i know that both when i was in sacramento and when we came here our daughter who is now 23 grew up calling sala burton aunt sala there was a very very close bond of friendship between our families on a very personal level they were always there phil and sala to give us some guidance some encouragement some reinvigoration of commitment to try to accomplish in some way the goals they set out for themselves and set as role models for us to try to emulate one of the most touching tributes

his political and personal relationship with phil and sala and that was speaker willy brant he closed his very eloquent remarks by saying that the best memorial tribute to sala burton is to try to act the way saia acted to try to live up to the ideals that she not only personified but urged upon all of us if we in some way could live up to that standard we would be by that example following her example and giving the greatest memorial to her i hope that as we remember fondly the memories of sala burton and the time we have had with her over the years the time that she has been with us in this institution that we will try to live up to the standards that she set for all of us to the goals and ideals that she so strongly and firmly believed in and in that way we will indeed be giving a living memorial to all the work that she has done over the years i do want to indicate that my wife janet had the opportunity to do an interview with sala burton a couple of months ago and i will

how much they loved her and how much they would miss her i have to say i was surprised because i thought she was just my special friend i thought that she was a political acquaintance to the other members of the house and she was a colleague to her colleagues from california but that she was my special friend i realize today that that was salas special gift that for each one of us she was our special friend she was a wonderful woman sala burton was a wonderful wife too i was fortunate enought to be a friend of both phil and sala i met phil in the late sixties here and he helped me to get

attorneys in miami are preparing to indict a senior haitian military figure on drug trafficking charges according to unitedstates and haitian exile sources col jeanclaude paul commander of the powerful dessaline battalion in haitis capital has been under suspicion of drug smuggling since 1986 sources say but only recently have investigators compiled enough evidence to proceed with grandjury activity and possible indictment ile would apparently be charged with aiding the flow of colombian cocaine to the unitedstates and of arms from the unitedstates to colombia sources say some sources say an indictment is imminent but given secrecy of the process others are unsure if colonel paul is indicted the case will severely challenge haitian president leslie manigat who has pledged a crackdown on drug smugglers though unitedstates officials were unwilling to discuss the judicial investigation they said an indictment could call into question the arrangements by which mr manigat came to power if he tries to fire paul unitedstates congressional sources say that will view this as a serious litmus test of civilian control in haiti and of how the unitedstates should deal with the new regime pauls unit is viewed as the most important in the country and his troops are fiercely loyal to him unitedstates officials say this makes it very difficult for haitis president or pauls nominal military superiors to move against him wellinformed haitians say paul has warned that he will not go down alone if others try to remove him paul allegedly played a major role in directing violence that upset the november elections in haiti because of close ties to the tonton macoutes the secret police created during the duvalier dictatorship the violence and killing paved the way for manigats election last month paul is seen as very close to the gen william regala who was no 2 man in haitis transitional junta and may be named defense minister he is the muscle and regala is the brain says a haitian opposition source but paul has an independent power base since becoming commander of the dessaline barracks in early 1986 he has assiduously wooed his troopsdining with them wearing fatigues like theirs supplementing their pay with bonuses allegedly funded from drug trafficking washington sources say they will kill at his command a haitian opposition source says paul has also reportedly incorporated several thousand tonton macoutes into his unit making it even more formidable us officials say hes got all the guns one us specialist says washington first raised reports of pauls activities in the transitional haitian government in 1986 but received no satisfactory reply officials say after the initial us complaints an internal haitian military investigation was launched haitian exile sources say the final report reportedly confirmed the charges and included aerial photos of pauls farm with a private landing strip but after the army chief of staff presented it to gen henri namphy the thenacting head of government the investigating officers were reportedly transferred and accused of plotting a coup the army chief of staff and the colonel in charge of the investigation were subsequently forced to retire us officials could not confirm the haltians charges while stressing their lack of knowledge of the us judicial investigation they say earlier us intelligence indicates paul is alleged to have taken over parts of the drugtrafficking ring once reportedly run by the fatherinlaw of mr duvalier pauls brother alexander former haitian consul in miami is reported to have been in that earlier operation and the current one they say colombian cocaine and marijuana were reportedly the staples of this trade informed haitians here say that paul is well tied into the tonton macoutes in part because his father was in the personal entourage of franqois duvalier who founded the group to keep the military and opponents in line pauls reported ill deeds go beyond drugs a reuter dispatch from haiti reports that he and his two brothers arranged to receive the 4 000 tons of waste from the city of philadelphia dumped on the haitian coast line near the port of gonaives in january haiti opposition sources have provided the monitcr with what appears to be an import authorization from haitis minister of commerce for the paul brothers to import 20 million kilograms of usorigin ash free of inspection unloading of the ash stopped after local residents vigorously complained news reports from haiti indicate the waste may contain high levels of dioxin press reports say the paul brothers reportedly received 200 a ton to accept the ash washington will be watching carefully how the haitian government reacts if the indictments are issued the us has cut off

the many moving words said of sala in recent days i think that these words spoken at her memorial service in san francisco by frank kielinger gave the greatest sense of who sala and phil burton were frank kieliger worked with and for the burtons for many years i would like to insert his remarks in the record yesterday as we stood in this rotunda and watched the people of san francisco pay tribute to sala there was a moment of overpowering grief and loss and i said to my son this is the last time we will see sala later as we walked in the dark through the plaza outside this teenager said to me dad your wrong look around you well isee sala every time we see these people only she would notice we had just passed one of the confused and homeless night people and we were in sight of the tents of those seeking help for aids victims by demonstrating at the old federal building in a single sentence he had captured sala he had told me her story elie wiesel in his work souls on fire tells us of the role of story and memory in our lives he writes my father an enlightened spirit believed in man my grandfather a fervant hasid believed in god the one taught me to speak and the other to sing both loved stories and when i tell mine i hear their voices whispering from beyond the silenced storm they are what links the survivor to their memory we are here today to refresh our memories and to renew our commitments to all that sala burton represents in her life we come to share our stories of her i leave to others the task of commenting on her political prowess and her skills as a legislator the sala i knew and loved was larger then the sum of these parts 1 have asked myself over and over what made her so special and how can that specialness be expressed in brief remarks i have searched my thirty year recollection of her and what i find is a woman so secure in the knowledge of her own humanity so secure in knowledge of her own dignity and worth as a person that she would spend her life defending the dignity and worth of others sala was a woman who could talk to me when i was a young man about the worlds indifference to the approaching holocaust and of her own personal experiences of eastern european antisemitism and of fleeing poland she could do so without hate but with a fierce determination that the story be told for sala this bitter lesson of the past must be alive in our memory so that this most heinous crime against humanity can never happen again she told me the story sala was a woman who lived rather than preached the values of her jewish heritage in her struggle for peace in the world for an end to the arms race for a world freed from the threat of nuclear annihilation in her opposition to the immoral practice of hiring mercenaries by funding the contras in nicaragua there can be heard the echoes of the prophet isaiah they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and nations shall make war no more in salas ceaseless quest for a just and more humane society a society which recognizes its obligations to the poor the aged the infirmed the homeless and all who are dispossessed in this land she made tangible the words of micah you have been told 0 man what is good and what is required of you to live justly to show mercy and to walk humbly with your god for sala accidents of race color creed national origin ancestry gender or sexual orientation could never be excuses for denying the inherent dignity of the human person and her life is summed up in the struggle to make that ideal a reality it was sala who introduced me to the reality of racial discrimination and racism and who educated me and formed my conscience on these issues as she involved me in the struggle for fair employment practices and fair housing in our state so many years ago it was sala who introduced me to the concept that the magnificent document we call the constitution of the united states protects all or it protects none it was sala who opened my eyes to the dangers of mccarthyslm and to its remnants in our society as we stood in union square and listened to phil then in the assembly call for the abolition of the house committee on un american activities some of us can still remember the picture of the hoses being turned on demonstrators and the water cascading down these very stain as dedicated civil libertarians were dragged down them for protesting the presence of that comnittee in our city and sala would feel deep anger at the sight of this injustice for sala was a woman whose conscience was so finely honed whose perceptions of social justice and human rights were so clear that she was truly a woman well ahead of her time she was a pioneer ever pressing forward ever encouraging the more fainthearted of us to follow where phil would move mountains by the shear volume of his knowledge and the weight of his arguments sala would touch the heart would prick the conscience would call us to be what we can and should be concerned and caring human beings when phil might seem preoccupied or distant in his singlemindedness sala was always the embodiment of care and concern they were a unique team their lives were both public and private and it is in the private moments that their great love and respect for one another was most evident and as i say these words i can envision phil even now reaching over and grasping her hand in a gesture which in life spoke volumes they are once again together they are once again an invincible team i have spoken of the sala i know with a very special affection it was she after all who suggested to phil many years ago that he hire me on a six month trial that six months stretched into twenty five rewarding years in which i learned from them that the purpose of public life is service that power is always exercised in behalf of the powerless and that those who possess the platform for public debate have the obligation to eloquently and forcefully express

administration took office rising from 40 billion in 1981 to over 170 billion in 1986 the administration has demonstrated that it is unable to respond satisfactorily to our evergrowing trade problem leaving congress no option but to step in with a legislative remedy h r 3 is such a remedy and is an appropriate and long overdue answer to our astounding trade deficit of special importance to my home state of west virginia are the provisions in the bill which deal with trade adjustment assistance worker benefits and other worker retraining and assistance programs the rate of unemployment in west virginia remains one of the highest in the nation and the state has the additional dubious distinction of having the highest rate of job loss due to plant closings in the country h r 3 modifies the trade adjustment assistance program in a manner which will be very beneficial to west virginia the bill specifies that all workers certified for assistance under taa would be entitled to up to 4 000 in training and remedial education benefits if the cost of the services provided is less than 4 000 the remainder could be used to pay relocation expenses presenilty workers receiving taa assisance apply for specific training and education programs and the amount of services provided to individual workers varies depending on the programs and their availability by creating an entitlement program the bill would ensure that all workers will receive an adequate level of service the bill creates a new option of supplemental wage payments under taa for workers who take a new job that pays less than their previous job specifically workers would be entitled to receive a supplemental wages 50 percent of their taa unemployment allowances subject to the limit that their new wages and supplement combined could not exceed 80 percent of their previous wage the typical supplement would be about 2 per hour and could continue for up to 1 year under the bill workers eligible for taa would be permitted to choose between undergoing retraining or taking a lesser paying job this option is especially important to older workers who may not wish to undergo retraining and begin a new career new badly needed funding sources for taa are established in h r 3 language in the bill specifies that any tariff revenues collected as a result of import relief or unfair trade actions are to be deposited in a special adjustment industry trust fund within the treasury to be used to help support taa or any other federal program that might be established for communities in which a substantial number of workers or firms are certified for ta expenditures from the trust fund would still be subject to annual appropriations title v of the bill establishes a new program of great importance to west virginia entitled worker readjustment which would provide comprehensive services to dislocated workers who have lost their jobs due to plant closings layoffs or other major disruptions this includes but is not limited to workers directly affected by increased imports h r 3 authorizes a total of 980 million for the new worker readjustment program for fiscal year 1988 the bill directs each state to establish a tripartite council to oversee the operation of the new program the councils would be composed of equal numbers of representatives from labor management and public and nonprofit organizations in addition the bill requires each state to designate a rapid response team or office within the state government which can respond immediately to major plant closings these teams would assist workers with reemployment employee buyouts enrollment in training progams and early retirement planning and would provide other social services under the bill 30 percent of the funds for the adjustment program would be allocated to basic readjustment servicesservices to meet the immediate needs of workers following a plant closing these services include job placement assistance counseling and job clerks up to 15 percent of funds for basic services could be used for supplemental income and supportive services for displaced workers no more than 15 percent of the funds could be used for administrative costs onehalf of the funds under the new adjustment program would be used for retraining and longterm adjustment assistance to displaced workers including classroom training literacy workshop onthejob training and remedial education the bill specifies that to the maximum extent possible workers should be given training certificates or vouchers so that they can select and arrange their own retraining up to 30 percent of this category of funds could be used for supplementary income and supportive services for displaced workers who otherwise could not afford to enter such retraining funds would be distributed among the states based on a weighted formula which takes into account each states unemployment rate its unemployment rate relative to other states and its longterm unemployment rate as a state with chronically high unemployment rates west virginia would receive a fair share of these funds finally the remaining 20 percent of the adjustment funds would be allocated at the discretion of the secretary of labor for special projects of national or regional concern these projects could include industrywide activities technical assistance responses to mass layoffs or demonstration projects to reiterate while h r 3 is a highly complex piece of legislation which deals with many aspects of this countrys trade policy i am especially supportive of the worker retraining provisions in the bill these provisions will go a long way toward alleviating the hardship and stress brought about by the unfair trading practices of many of this

particular issue but i find it necessary because of the direction that i see that the house is taking i served in the field of public health education before i went into the political arena i worked in the field of tuberculosis that was a communicable disease i remember very well back in the late 1930s and early 1940s that the same kind of hysteria that we find here in this house today we found in state legislatures in city councils and in boards of supervisors in the state of california it was a time when the incidence of tuberculosis was the very highest there was not a single sanitarium in the entire country that was not full now tuberculosis is closely associated with poverty and the one thing that i remember happening then is that the health authorities were constantly telling the legislators that something of course had to be done but it had to be done in cooperation with those who understood epidemiology the epidemiologists of that time and the health authorities it took that combination before we were finally able to almost eradicate tuberculosis now that particular disease is on the rise again again due to poverty again due to all these other things that contribute greatly to the incidence of communicable diseases in general i believe that we must go back now to the time and carefully consider the fact that experience has taught us a great deal in the last few years and what it did teach us with regard to tuberculosis and other communicable diseases was that it was not the prerogative of the legislator by himself to do anything but that the legislator in order to be effective had to be in full consultation with the experts of health epidemiologists and also be in touch constantly with the problems existing in the community i think that this house would be ill advised to adopt any of these amendments i think that what we should do is to make it possible for a committee of this house to study the situation in cooperation with the department of health with the health authorities of this nation and with the experts who are now studying the incidence of aids in this nation you probably remember that it was not too long ago that we brought in the first appropriation for aids right here in this house you probably will remember that up to that time not a single penny had been spent of research well that was 5 years ago now we know a little bit more than we did before but we also have the experience of the past with other communicable diseases it seems to me that we as legislators should take one step back and as we do that make it possible for the experts to come in the doctors those who are involved with this and to advise us as to what the next step should be that i offer as humble advice from someone who actually dealt in that field believe me if we do not do that i think the time will come when we may live to regret it"], [0.9865939617156982, 0.9865939617156982, 0, "i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5

roots that we have forgotten the men and women who cre ated this great country of ours what about these americans who dumped tea into boston harbor in defiance of the british rulers what of those who fought and died at saratoga and at valley forge these were no fancy military experts but they knew if they could get their freedom they had to fight for it and that is what the contras are doing the individuals that we are proposing to cut off with this legislation what a travesty that so many members of this body should be opposing the men and women who seek freedom and who hate a cruel and ruthless dictatorship have we forgotten how our country was built the brave men and women who crossed the river delaware with general washington to put to rout the british enemy whom they had opposed they were also contras they were contra england how can we justify a vote in opposition to these nicaraguan freedom fighters how can we turn our backs to those who seek freedom who are even willing to give their lives in freedom let us remember that nicaragua is in desparate straits its inflation rate is at an astounding 13 000 percent and as the eloquent columnist of the washington post mr krauthammer said if the united states stops helping the contras she will have managed the most extraordinary self inflicted strategic surrender in memory our decline will be well earned certainly no redblooded american would want to be present at that consummation this afternoon we are debating the future of tile contras but the basic issue in this debate is what america itself is all about the opportunity of freedom over the years america has stood for freedom and thousands of people from other lands have come to america because they hated oppression one of the very first actions of the new united states of america was a proposal sponsored by our fourth president james lonroethe monroe doctrineand its impact was sweeping that we would tot permit any foreign government to eatablish itself in our hemisphere we wanted only governments that were free as we in america the issue before this free american congress today is freedom itself the nicaraguan government as everybody knows has violated that monroe doctrine a native leftwing groupthe sandinistasforcefully took over the somoza government but they only did so by promising the organization of american states that they would establish a free democratic government that would include other parties that free elections would be held and that would include persons representing all groups in the nation but those promises were quickly shoved aside and the government of the ortega boys promptly forgot their promises to the nicaraguan peopleabout freedom within a short time nicaragua has become a totalitarian communist

allowing me to offer an amendment or have an amendment offered i also want to thank the gentleman from new york for introducing my amendment the amendment that the gentleman from new york offered is very important to me but it is also very important to our country because the amendment is consistent with the thrust of the action we are taking here tonight and that is to protest through sanctions the actions of the iraqi government what this amendment of which i speak does is to state clearly what our policy toward iraq should be this amendment is very important to me not only because it is an appropriate policy but because of a situation that occurred locally in my district where a corporation named usx formerly united states steel was attempting to sell a millionton capacity steel plant in my district to iraq usx is a company that laid off 2 500 workers 2 years ago it is protected through steel import limitations imposed by the federal government it receives tax credits and tax preferences and it has privileges extended to few other unitedstates corporations it is a company that could sell to one of over five interested domestic companies who would pay equal or greater value than the iraqis which would result in the creation of over 750 jobs in economically depressed baytown tx but while usx has exhibited the worst possible corporate behavior and corporate citizenship the thrust of this amendment and legislation is to state a policy and the amendment states and i quote that it is the policy of the united states to prohibit the export to iraq of goods and technology that would significantly contribute to the military potential of iraq because steel is a major component of military hardware a large steel facility would certainly contribute to iraqs military potential but in addition to the use of steel and military hardware the texas works plant specifically has the capability of producing armorized steel plate for use in building military tanks planes and ships that is why i say the amendment is consistent with the thrust of this legislation the amendment goes on to state that the president should review under section 6 of the export administration act any proposed export of goods or technology to iraq valued over 50 million now section 6 of the export administration act deals with exports which are prohibited for foreign policy reasons in other words to accomplish foreign policy goals the export of goods may be banned the goods need not be sensitive technology a requirement under other sections of the export administration act i am proud to

abdicates the forthright position we have taken over the past difficult year we made a promise to the american people when we passed the grammrudman deficit reduction amendment in 1985 a promise that we would stick to tough responsible deficitreduction targets regardless of the political fallout sticking to those targetswhich for this next fiscal year is a deficit of no more than 108 billionis what grammrudman was originally all about we promised the ameican people that we would bite the bullet when the time came if necessary to tackle this deficit headon and not back down to political expediency the proposed compromise would be a slap in the face of the american people after making this promise instead of lowering the deficit to 108 billion it would be allowed to slip to 144 billion or so in my opinion this would be an act of collective handwashing of the tough choices it takes to get this deficit under control ssional record extensions o the socalled compromise doesnt stop there either the office of management and budget would be given permission to cook the numbers for maximum political gain all of which adds up to complete contravention of the spirit and the letter of the original grammrudman process the problem of course is that we all realize that the grammrudman target of 108 billion canot be reached with spending cuts alone president reagan himself asked for 22 billion in revenue increases in his budget request earlier this year and the house of representatives while reducing the presidents revenue request by 4 billion recognizes this need as well even if congress were to cut 20 billion in spending and raise 20 billion in new revenue president reagan will veto the 20 billion in new revenue the target will be missed and this compromise proposal if passed will force the congress to vote for sequestration and worse it will force the president to sign the sequestration order regardless of the economic impact on america the president has requested all year that the congress present him with a clean debt limit extension that s what i would vote for given the chance and thats what this house ought to do an unencumbered debt limit would permit the original grammrudman amendment as modified by the unitedstates supreme court to be in place and force us tb deal directly with a tough deficit target the truth as i have said since 1982 is that you cannot achieve meaningful deficit reduction through spending cuts alone but it will take a combination of revenue increases and spending cuts with the revenue increases dedicated to deficit reduction we should also quit reducing taxes while increasing spending one reason i opposed the tax reform legislation in 1986 was that it permitted huge reductions in the top rates for those wealthy taxpayers making more than 100 000 a year those rates have dropped from 50 percent to 38 percent and they are scheduled to drop another 10 percent next year those are the tax cuts that we should consider freezing at the current rate to prevent further losses in tax revenues that are desperately needed to fight the deficit the problem with raising the deficit target from 108 billion to 144 billion is that it gets us off the hook it means that we dont have to cut spending quite as much and we dont have to raise as much revenue cutting spending and raising revenues are painful choices but they are necessary the old saying no pain no gain is true and we are not going to make progress toward balancing the budget if we allow the targets to be manipulated to avoid making the tough choices if theres no recognition by this congress that the american people already understand that the national debt is the single greatest concern in the country today then we will surely find out that is the case in the 1988 elections the interest on the national debt is second only to defense and social security as the single largest item in the budget that we can control and more and more americans recognize it for the looming crisis it is we should have become convinced by our constituents that we must stick to the fundamentals of the original grammrudman legislation those principles are tough but fair we have no business fudging f remarks september 16 1987 the target numbers each year we put off the tough choices we will only have them come back twice as tough the next time around lets honor our promise to the american people by sticking to the original grammrudman amendment and meet our deficit targets through real budget reform and a responsible combination of spending cuts and revenue increases"]]}
