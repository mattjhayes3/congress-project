our colleagues and we support each other in times of need i just would like to also congratulate and acknowledge congressman hakeem jeffries the gentleman from new york who is also host of this special order i appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my district to engage directly with constituents about the importance of making positive health decisions and staying proactive about their health and wellbeing so i encourage everyone watching at home to get the information you need to make smart health decisions to get the security you and your family deserve and to get the health care that we all need"], [0.0017754435539245605,

caucus assessment during national minority health month it is no surprise that we are here today because certainly we have had many firsthand experiences to know the disparities that exist across all americans but more specifically across african american communities to you mr payne thank you for having the foresight to come tonight and to you congresswoman kelly thank you for taking a leadership position in helping us share with the nation the value and the importance of protecting all lives but giving information to the nation about the state of black health it is imperative that we continue to address health disparities that affect racial minorities and work together on the efforts to advance health equity since july 1971 the congressional black caucus has sponsored national conferences and held brain trusts on black health it is so timely that we have this discussion as we observe national minority health month tonight is a call to action a charge for all of us to unite towards a common goal of improving the health of our communities everyone in america should be able to live a healthy life regardless of the color of their skin the good news is the overall health of an american has improved over the past few decades this is in part due to the increased focus on preventive medicine and dynamic new advances in medical technology however not all americans have benefited equally from healthcare improvements since the enactment of the affordable care act millions of americans now have access to quality affordable coverage according to the american medical association recent studies have shown that despite the steady improvement in overall health of the united states racial and ethnic minorities experience a lower quality of health services and are less likely to receive routine medical procedures and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality than nonminorities disparities in health care exist even when controlling for gender condition age and socioeconomic status for example cardiovascular diseases account for the largest proportion of inequality in life expectancy between african americans and nonhispanic whites according to the american cancer society african american women have a 44 percent higher death rate from breast cancer despite having a mammography screening rate that is nearly the same rate for white women according to the centers for disease control the cdc the infant death rate among african americans is still more than double that of whites tonight you are going to hear my colleagues and i discuss much data and statistics because i am from the great state of ohio and ohio ranks 47th in the nation in infant mortality with black infants dying at twice the rate of white infants according to a 2015 study conducted by the kaiser family foundation in ohio on average 14 5 black infants die per every 1 000 live births while 6 3 white infants die ohio community leaders and the greater columbus infant mortality task force are working hard to lower franklin countys infant mortality rate and the infant mortality rate in all of ohio tonight i salute them for their research for their education and for their consistency to save lives the statistics are staggering and we can and must do more to lower and eliminate them the societal burden of healthcare disparities in america manifest in multiple and major ways for example a 2014 study by the joint center for political and economic studies concluded that the combined costs of health inequalities and premature death in the united states were 1 24 trillion that 1 24 trillion is the cost between 2003 and 2006 that is why on march 23 2010 when president barack obama signed the affordable care act it was a monumental step that has helped us address the overwhelming statistics and health disparities within our community i proudly supported the affordable care act because lives matter all lives matter black lives matter now we have comprehensive healthcare reform that improves access to affordable health coverage and guarantees that the most vulnerable in our communities have access to care by improving access to quality health care for all americans the affordable care act helps reduce health disparities how does the affordable care act do this this law invests in prevention and wellness gives individuals more control over their care and expands initiatives to increase racial and ethnic diversity in healthcare professions by strengthening cultural competency training for all healthcare providers and improving communications between providers and patients the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history congressman payne and congresswoman kelly again i salute you i am going to repeat that because it is so important for us to let the nation know that the affordable care act represents the most significant federal effort to reduce disparities in this countrys history the affordable care act also increases funding for community health centers which serve an estimated one in three lowincome people and one in four lowincome minority residents there are over 43 community health centers in ohio including many in my district columbus neighborhood health centers heart of ohio family health centers and lower lights christian health centers these community health centers provide outstanding primary care dental behavioral health and pharmacy services in our most underserved areas in 2013 community health centers provided care to over 550 000 ohioans and recorded over 2 million patient visits we have come a long way but there is still much more for us to do all people should have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential for health we must continue to move forward to combat health disparities build healthier communities and create a stronger country in order to have a successful nation i believe we must have a healthy nation let me leave you with something a national figure once said if you neglect to recharge a battery it dies if you run full speed ahead without stopping for water you lose momentum to

gentleman from the eighth congressional district of new york i say to the gentleman that i look forward to tonights special order hour congressman jeffries and i along with our colleagues from the congressional black caucus will have scholarly debate on how our democracy is in crises because of the assault on the right to vote in america as we just heard from mr jeffries and we will hear from others voting is the voice of the people the voting rights act of 1965 passed with bipartisan support established strong federal protections for the freedom to vote banning or limiting many of the discriminatory election policies and practices of the jim crow south combined with subsequent legislation such as the national voter registration act which requires state agencies to provide opportunities for voter registration the voting rights act has helped our nation make significant progress in boosting voting for african americans and other historically marginalized groups but we find ourselves today facing our first presidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the voting rights act as mr jeffries referenced in shelby the supreme court decision reversed over 50 years of progress made to expand access to the voting booth and opened a pathway to new voting laws that discriminate against african american voters as a result of shelby new voting restrictions have been put in place in 22 states 18 of them republicanled since 2010 making it harder for millions of americans to exercise their right to vote the way states have been able to reduce the voting power of minority communities and put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to make it harder for millions of americans to vote is appalling our democracy is in crisis our right to vote is under assault why would we want to make it harder for americans to vote i believe we should be making it easier for americans to have access to the ballot box but apparently some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not agree we need to put forth a vote on the voting rights act now new laws range from strict photo id requirements to early voting cutbacks to registration restriction among these 16 states with new voting restrictions is my home state of ohio in ohio in 2014 lawmakers cut 6 days of early voting and eliminated the golden week during which voters could register and cast a ballot all in one trip of course ohio is not alone in its efforts to make it harder for americans to vote the freedom to vote is one of americas most constitutionally guaranteed rights and it should be easily accessible to those who want to exercise it that is why i am honored this congress to serve as the deputy vice chair of the newly created congressional voting rights caucus a caucus dedicated to protecting our democracy by ensuring the fundamental right to vote is safeguarded for all americans however after a longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on voting protections house republicans now refuse to bring either bill to the floor for a vote this is unthinkable the voting rights act of 1965 has been reauthorized with bipartisan support five times congress has a duty to ensure elections are free and transparent so that all eligible voters feel comfortable and welcome i would echo president obamas february 13 2013 statement on the voting rights act and let me quote we must all do our part to make sure our godgiven rights are protected that includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote when any american no matter where they live or what their party are denied that right we are betraying our ideals there are 168 days until the presidential election and our democracy still has far too many missing voices particularly among those who are already at a disadvantage due to deeply rooted racial and class barriers in our society we must ensure that voter suppression is not the new normal in order to have a truly vibrant democracy the united states must take steps to ensure inclusive voting by reducing barriers to voting efforts to suppress voting turnout undermine democracy and those efforts are on the wrong side of history as i close the time is now i am calling on all people including our community and national leaders to join me in working to eliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought for marched for died for that is the voting rights act human rights organizations like the naacp and the leadership conference on civil and human rights have been at the forefront

killed in our country by someone using a gun 34 000 that is someones child someones brother someones loved one someones wife someones husband someones partner and it is absolutely shameful now we heard yesterday on the steps of the capitol a terrifying story from a woman whose 10yearold daughter was murdered by someone with a gun someone who couldnt legally buy a gun because he couldnt pass a background check he was a felon but he got around that law because he went online he found the same gun that you could buy in a gun store online but without the requirement to pass a background check

abusers a day are stopped from getting a gun because of background checks it sounds like pretty solid policy to me it must be the politics on the other side that are getting in the way and the

his duty to respond to lawfully issued congressional subpoenas on august 2 2013 the committee on oversight and government reform of the house of representatives issued a subpoena to the secretary of the treasury jacob lew the custodian of the internal revenue service documents that subpoena demanded among other things all communications sent or received by lois lerner from january 1 2009 to on

20 2014 commissioner koskinen testified that since the start of this investigation every email has been preserved nothing has been lost nothing has been destroyed number 2 on june 23 2014 commissioner koskinen testified that the internal revenue service had confirmed that backup tapes from 2011 no longer existed because they have been recycled pursuant to the internal revenue services normal policy he went on to explain that confirmed means that somebody went back and looked and made sure that in fact any backup tapes that had existed had been recycled number 3 on march 26 2014 commissioner

suspected terrorists that is shameful the american people deserve a congress that is willing to stand up to the gun lobby and do what it takes to help keep our communities safe congress has a responsibility to listen to the people who we are supposed to represent to put partisan politics aside and to bring up commonsense bipartisan legislation to keep guns away from those who shouldnt have them suspected terrorists criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill and the american people want those bills brought up now more than 30 people are killed every day by someone using

isnt an insulated case it has now been 31 2 years since the tragedy at sandy hook took the lives of 20 elementary school kids and six educators but for reasons that i will never understand that horrific tragedy wasnt enough to convince the republican leadership that somethingsomethingneeds to be done to prevent the next tragedy let me give you some numbers three and a half that is how many years it has been since sandy hook 34 000 that is the number of people who have been killed by someone using a gun since sandy hook 1 182 that is the number of mass shootings that have taken place since sandy hook 520 that is the number of days the house has been in session 30 the moments of silence that we have observed on this house floor because of gun violence most important zero zero that is the number of votes that this house has taken to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people what is the majority so afraid of is their fear greater than the fear of those young kids at sandy hook or those parishioners in charleston or those young people at the nightclub in orlando it is long past time for the house to give us a vote on meaningful legislation to make sure that terrorists criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill dont have easy access to guns in our country there is bipartisan legislation that would prohibit those on the fbis terrorist watch list from being able to purchase firearms and i have authored legislation which has bipartisan support to require background checks for all commercial gun sales background checks are our first line of defense when it comes to stopping dangerous people from getting firearms they work every day more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives are stopped from buying a gun because of background checks but in 34 states criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill can bypass the background check by purchasing guns online at a gun show or through an ad in the paper this is a dangerous loophole that needs to be closed and it needs to be closed now the bill has 186 bipartisan coauthors bring our bill up for a vote there is absolutely no reason why anyone should oppose this background check bill not only is it bipartisan it respects the second amendment rights of lawabiding citizens i am a gun guy i own guns i support the second amendment if this bill did anything to violate those rights my name wouldnt be on it all this background check bill does is require that folks pass a background check before purchasing guns online at a gun show or through an ad plain and simple it does nothing to infringe on the second amendment right of lawabiding citizens to own firearms this debate on background checks isnt a choice between either protecting the second amendment or reducing gun violence it is about the willingness of a responsible majority to do both if there is one thing we should all be able to agree on it is that suspected terrorists criminals

leadership to really tell the truth and let the entire country know exactly what the economic status is what the job opportunities and educational opportunities are in the african american community and how those disparities continue to grow and really how we need to really do everything we can here to begin to close those gaps and disparities so thank you very much once again we stand here tonight to discuss economic opportunityof course i have to say the lack of opportunity in the black community in recent months we have seen communities across this countryincluding baltimore and my hometown of oakland california in my congressional districtdemand an end to the systemic and institutional racial biases that plague our society people especially young people are calling for an end to centuries of oppression they are fighting for equality of opportunity the opportunity for every american to live the american dream too many places in our nation are tales of two cities one city is bright shiny and new it is home to new condominiums and fancy restaurants the other city is left with boarded up stores abandoned homes and too many people without a job and without hope i know congresswoman kelly congressman payne congressman jeffries myself all of us represent these cities these two cities within one context one environment one framework one boundary we all know that the inequality of opportunity really is not a new phenomenon we have lived with these structural injustices for centuries but it wasnt until the race riots erupted in watts chicago and detroit in 1968 that our government began to take some notice after the riots president johnson convened the kerner commission to investigate the root causes of the unrest the kerner report clearly showed a nation moving towards two societies one black one whiteseparate and unequal while the kerner report identified the problem our nation failed to truly address it there still is not liberty and justice for all the kerner report also called for better training for police new investments in jobs and in housing and the end of de facto segregation now this report really could have been written last month sadly nearly 50 years later we still live in a country where the color of your skin and the zip code in which you were born determines your future but i am proud to be working with members of the congressional black caucus to continue to address these persistent inequalities in our nation by working on policies and programs to create economic growth educational opportunities and job opportunities for example we know that black children are disadvantaged from day one more than one in three black children are born in poverty that is one in three in the worlds richest and most powerful nation a third of all african american children are forced to grow up with the harsh reality of poverty day in and day out this is outrageous it is unacceptable the cycle of poverty continues in the school systems that institutionalize this discrimination while black students represent just 18 percent of preschool enrollment they account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions can you believe that preschool student expulsionsthat is really a disgrace we are talking about kids ages 2 to 5 years old these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start what in the world are children that young doing being expelled from preschool then in high school the graduation rate for black students is 16 points lower than the rate for their white peers black students are far less likely than their white counterparts to obtain a 4year college degree and the crisis and inequality extends from education to the economy itself over the past four decades the unemployment rate for blacks has remained nearly double the rate for whites today the unemployment rate in the black community stands at 10 1 percent that is reported now to put that into context the current african american unemployment rate is higher than the national average was at the height of the great recession in addition to higher unemployment rates african americans are also nearly completely locked out of some key economic sectors especially the tech sector only 1 in 14 technical workers in silicon valley is african american or latino that is 1 in 14 that is why the cbc has launched the tech 2020 initiative to work with the tech sector to increase workforce diversity and investments in stem education and to expand market opportunities for businesses to ensure that the jobs of today and tomorrow are open to all for african americans in the workforce our nations inequalities are also evident in their paychecks congressman payne just laid out the statistics for women while women earn 77 cents on the dollar that a man earns it is just 64 cents for african american women the median income for blacks is a mere 34 000 that is nearly 24 000 less than the median income for whites most black families hold their wealth in home equity so the great recession hit the black community particularly hard too many families lost everything and many more black families are struggling as home prices fail to keep pace with the stock market of course the net worth now of african american families is now 6 cents to the dollar for white families the time for action is now these communities our communities cannot wait any longer we must come together like never before to address the inequalities in our nation that leave black families behind in my role as cochair of the cbcs task force on poverty and the economy and chair of the democratic whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity we are working very hard to give black families a fair shot we are talking about all families not leaving any family behind i am proud to be working with more than 100 of my colleagues to advance policies that build pathways out of poverty into the middle class for everyone for all americans yes black lives like all lives do count we have introduced the half in ten act to develop a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade this bill would lift more than 22 million americans out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by doubling down and coordinating proven antipoverty programs the congressional black caucus also took a stand on poverty in its alternative budget proposal we called for robust investments in education infrastructure and affordable housing programs that would ensure opportunities for all we must keep up this fight until congress makes these long overdue investments we need to strengthen the social safety net and invest in proven antipoverty programs such as the earned income tax credit and the supplemental nutritional assistance program these were initiatives begun 50 years ago under president lyndon johnsons great society program and they are working we also need to raise the minimum wage and fight for a living wage that is why we are cosponsors and we are very proud to be cosponsors of h r 122 the original living wage act sponsored by congressman al green which starts by raising the minimum wage for federal workers and building up to a living wage and congressman bobby scotts raise the wage act h r 2150 would increase the minimum wage to 12 by 2020 thirtyfive million americans would benefit from this also we wrote a letter signed by 72 colleagues urging the president to adopt a fair chance hiring policy at the federal level for individuals who have been previously

government should not put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and having paid their dues to society finally i am saying tonight and i think all of us are saying that we need to give families the opportunity to build wealth and live the american dream we can end poverty not just in the african american community but in the entire united states as a whole so we have got to keep calling for action as dr king said in his two americas speech that he gave on april 14 1968 at stanford university 1968 he said we must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability it comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of dedicated individuals we must be those dedicated individuals working for the social progress that is so desperately needed when you look at the analysis of the economy job opportunities and educational opportunities in the african american community we must win this fight because the gaps and the disparities are too great only then will america be strong because we have to remember that we are a country where everyone is equal under the law in fact when you have communities with such horrible statistics as we are laying out tonight such horrible economic and educational gaps our country is not as strong as it could be and so we are saying that we want liberty and justice for everyone that all lives matter including black lives"], [0.0019089579582214355, 0.9980910420417786, 1, "i rise this evening for tonights congressional black caucus special order hour the work continueswhy voting matters in the african american community i am so proud to join my classmate congressman hakeem jeffries from the eighth district of new york he is a member of the house judiciary committee he continues to be a tireless advocate for social justice working to reform our criminal justice system and to eliminate the overcriminalization of the african american community we are here to discuss the current state of voting rights in america which unfortunately are under assault the freedom to vote is one of americas most fundamentally constitutionally guaranteed rights it was 51 years ago this month that over 600 peaceful orderly protesters set off to march from selma alabama to the state capitol in montgomery to demonstrate the need for voting rights in the state last week our congressional black caucus chair chairman butterfield stated at the first in a series of cbc hearings about the current state of voting rights in america and that the voting rights act of 1965 is probably one of the most significant pieces of legislation that was ever passed in the united states congress certainly as we know in 2013 the unitedstates supreme court struck down this crucial provision of the voting rights act in the shelby county v holder decision our work continues because by invalidating section 4 of the voting rights act the supreme court opened the doors for ways to reduce the voting power of minority communities and it put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to make it harder for millions of americans to vote our democracy has far too many missing voices particularly those who are already at a disadvantage due to deeprooted racial and class barriers in our society by exercising our right we can do great things we can hold this country accountable we can advocate for legislation that supports social and economic progress equality and fairness for all americans we can champion policies that create and sustain jobs and that protect against cuts to social and economic programs that are vital to our most atrisk populations we can move forward on efforts to address the schooltoprison pipeline and criminal justice reform we know that the inequalities in access to quality health care still exist between races and that more and more black children are victims of failing schools i am calling on all citizens including on our community and national leaders to join the congressional black caucus to work to eliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought for marched and died foryes the voting rights act it is up to all of us to protect the most atrisk among us and to expand opportunity for all people that begins with passing a voting rights act our work still continues this week we are celebrating womens history month and i must note the powerful impact that african american women are having at the polls in the past two presidential elections black women led all demographic groups in voter turnout that is why voting matters to african american communities black women make up the most dynamic segment of the rising american voters a great civil rights leader said that women are among the greatest leaders of social reform and they are fighting literally fighting for their political rights this past saturday i had the opportunity to be with the mothers of the movement we know who they are they are the mothers of trayvon martin eric garner dontre hamilton jordan davis sandra bland and hadiya pendleton and we have all heard what happened to their children as a member of the congressional black caucus we are calling for action on gun control we need to do more than just stand up on this floor for a moment of silence we need to make sure that we are passing gun control legislation commonsense legislation that keeps the guns out of the hands of the most dangerous individuals it is time for us to protect our children i am going to give you some examples of what we should include in our call for action i go first to my good friend and colleague and classmate who brought it to my attention that we stand up for a moment and then we sit down then we come back to this floor and it is business as usual we talk about wanting to keep our families safe and we talk about the mental health issues that is all we do we talk about it congresswoman robin kelly of illinois second district has legislation h r 224 which would require the surgeon general of public health services to submit to congress an annual report on the effects of gun violence on public health this bill has 140 democrat cosponsors i am asking my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to step up and do more than just stand up for 30 seconds i am calling on congress to act on congressman james clyburn of the sixth district of south carolinas legislation h r 3051 the background check completion act which would guarantee that no gun is sold by a licensed dealer until a background check is completed i am very proud to say that i am a cosponsor of both of these bills i will go on and tell you about chairman butterfield the chair of our congressional black caucus he understands that our work continues because he has focused his efforts on promoting antipoverty programs and on expanding economic development and job creation there are a number of things that have happened in his state for example the moral mondays are protests in north carolina that are led by religious progressives these protests are in response to several actions by the government of north carolina which was elected into office in 2013 these events which spread throughout the south helped bring attention to voting rights criminal justice reform and workers rights i think it is very important for us to note that tonight my coanchor and i will talk about a number of issues that explain why our work continues we are going to talk about why in african american communities it is important for us to understand if we dont diversify those who are going to vote we dont represent the diversity of this great america that we are here to protect and to serve 2030 it is not just members of the congressional black caucus who value and understand the importance of us coming together the importance of us celebrating our rich history all tied to the voting rights act all tied to the movements that we have had of the past let me give you a great example because i am so proud that i am going to have the privilege to yield time to my good friend congressman john larson from the

participating in the diversity dinners last week i cant have congressman payne have a oneup on me so thank you so much i really appreciate it as we continue our conversation on accountability equality and diversity i would like to offer some statistics on our economy 50 years ago and today with respect to the african american community and women in 1965 african american jobseekers could be denied employment based on the color of their skin and when they could find jobs they were disproportionately paid less than white males in the same position in fact in 1965 the black unemployment rate was 8 1 percent almost twice the national unemployment rate which stood at 4 5 percent fifty years later we have made great strides and our nations workforce is more diverse than ever but we have much more work to do today at 10 4 percent the black unemployment rate is still almost double the national unemployment rate of 5 6 percent while it is significantly smaller there is still a racial wage gap the median african american household has less than twothirds the income of the average white median household in the past year we have seen the greatest economic growth in decades more and more women have been able to enter the workforce reducing the employment rate among women to a 6year low unfortunately black women have yet to reap the benefits of the economic rebound in fact while the overall unemployment rate for women declined the black female unemployment rate has increased over the past 2 months according to a recent analysis by the national womens law center the black womens unemployment rate is more than twice the unemployment rate of white women despite having comparable levels of education black women have had the highest unemployment rate of any other group a possible factor in the stubborn unemployment rate for black women is that we are disproportionately employed in the public sector which is experiencing a much slower recovery than the private sector nwlc said the stagnant job situation for black women is a red flag in the employment landscape and urged lawmakers to act to promote a stronger more widely shared recovery i couldnt agree more we need to invest more in job training and retraining programs that help black women adapt to the changing workforce and prepare for the careers of tomorrow we must work to promote diversity in hiring and encourage employers to model their workforces on the communities in which they operate as we look for ways to help increase diversity in the workplace and help women succeed we must be mindful of the unique challenges black women face and develop targeted policies that help level the playing field for all women these facts i have just covered point to the systemic problems we need to address them today it should be our mission today to see to it that in 50 years when lawmakers stand here they will proudly be touting the progress our nation has made because all americans are paid equally and no is discriminated against in the workplace as chair of the congressional black caucus health braintrust i am working to address our nations health equity gap by exploring legislative and policy initiatives to reduce minority health disparities and promote better health outcomes for all americans with respect to the african american community the health disparity gap is particularly wide as blacks have high rates of many adverse health conditions across the medical spectrumfrom cancer to diabetes from hypertension to strokeblacks are overrepresented and often undertreated a major barrier to african americans getting the medical care they need is the lack of african american doctors in their communities studies show that african americans are more comfortable seeking treatment from doctors who look like them and are much more likely to adhere to courses of treatment prescribed by black doctors yet while african americans comprise 13 percent of the unitedstates population we represent only 4 percent of the physician workforce according to the association of american medical colleges 2014 diversity in the physician workforce report the infamous tuskegee study fostered an enduring legacy of mistrust of the medical establishment in the african american community that makes diversity in medicine vital to closing the health disparities gap in order to achieve health equity we must work to create a physician workforce that reflects our nation one key way to do that is to encourage more african americans to pursue education and training in science technology engineering and math congress must do more to support investments in stem education and to create avenues of access for african american students to enter the stem fields in my district i launched the second congressional district stem academy to expose students to stem fields in hopes of encouraging them to pursue stemrelated careers also a stem workforce made up of diverse ranks is crucial to future innovation to help in that mission folks across the country and in silicon valley have taken note i know facebook has sought to change the face of innovation through efforts like their facebook academy and facebook university which target high school and college students from underrepresented groups similar to my stem academy it is good to see them making an effort to build a pipeline and introduce women and people of color to jobs in stemwhich of course could be it engineeringand hopefully more young people decide to become doctors and they can work in african american communities or underserved communities a medical student population that reflects our countrys population will create a pipeline of diverse doctors to our communities which will in turn put all americans on track to live a healthier life i turn back to my colleague from new jersey congressman donald payne"], [0.0019126534461975098, 0.9980873465538025, 1, "there is no doubt how much i appreciate the congressional black caucus and congresswoman beatty and congressman jeffries for always being timely in allowing us to give a message to our colleagues we hope maybe the american people will hear us but we accept that this body is the body to which and to whom we speak so i am thankful for that i want to pay tribute overall to the congressional black caucus because we are actually here speaking of health disparities because it was the caucus that triggered this debate through the years that we have been trying to get universal access to health care and was the moving force in the 2009 2008 and 2010 passage ultimately of the affordable care act where the work that we did joining congresswoman donna christianchristiansen at that time and frank pallone on the congressional health caucus but on the cbc we had the health disparities task to ensure that the language in the affordable care act addressed the issue of health disparities there was a large section on that that built on some of the work that some of us had already done creating the office of minority health that i had worked on in years past so it was the lightning bolt of the caucus and then working with the congressional asian pacific american caucus and then the congressional hispanic caucus that we raised the issue that no one was talking about i remember debating on the floor of the house on the issues of dealing with senior citizen african american men and how they access health care how do women access health care and how do women impacted by diabetes access health care these are some of the diseases that have a proclivity to the african american population we were finding out that we even had an issue where medical professionals didnt know how to ask the questions how do you address someone who needs to be diagnosed for prostate cancer or may be diagnosed for prostate cancer and is an african american male a senior citizen my father ultimately died from cancer that metastasized from the prostate to the lungs and the brain so we knew we had a serious issue so today i want to mention four points but i am going to focus on the last one obesitya question of access to health care and physical fitness many times we live in areas where there is no access to a pool or a tennis court mental healthif you lived your life in a segregated america if you were called boy and girl it is a different mental health situation than maybe others may have faced if you live in a situation of poverty of a single household maybethis is not across the boardthese issues will be impacted if you lived around gun violence if you saw your 15yearold friend being shot dead in the street there is a question of mental health that we need access to that care for us to be able to reach out or maybe counselors to be able to provide for children hiv aids is something that we have lived through i remember going to funerals of friends in the 1980s and into the 1990s particularly with hiv aids so we have worked in the congressional black caucus to massively talk about testing let me get to this point that i want to dwell just for a moment on and that is gun violence i was here on the floor earlier with my head held down and my heart heavy as my district today had a memorial they had one yesterday we will have one tomorrow and have one on wednesday i mourn with congresswoman corinne brown of florida we are offering legislation dealing with the assault weapons and to complement legislation already passed or already in place but it is important to note that this is a health issue because the centers for disease control can assess and study every health issue that faces america today but they are legislatively by law prohibited by my friends on other side of the aisle by republicans disallowed every year to give them permission to study gun violence gun violence is killing our children and killing our families in orlando it killed latinos who happened to be the attendees at the pulse club the lgbtq community was the dominant community and a hateful terroristic act using ar15s and glock guns killed them the incident was the deadliest mass shooting the next deadliest incidents in recent history were april 16 2007 virginia tech 32 killed 17 injured december 14 2012 sandy hook 26 killed 1 injured october 16 1991 killeen texas 23 killed 27 injured according to everytown index of mass shootings where four or more people are shot and killed the incident was the ninth mass shooting in the united states in 2016 and the 150th mass shooting in united states since january 1 2009 the mass shooting with guns impacts both the mental health the sanctity and the minority community it is shameful that we are not allowed to engage in the kind of research that a harvard professor talked about and that is the assessing of violence and the assessing of violence with guns the materials i have before me make it very clear that most of these violent acts are done with gunsdone with guns san bernardino chattanooga charleston garland oak creek and fort hood were all done with guns so i stand here today to challenge this issue of health disparities to say that the heavy brunt of killings singular killings are impacted by poverty lack of access to health care the proliferation of guns in our inner city communities and the failure of the united states congress to put real gun safety legislation closing the loophole the jim clyburn rule that says that if you dont get the review and approval by atf you do not get the gun you have to wait until you get the approval from atf which may be trying to determine whether this person with multiple problems mental health or background issues doesnt need to get a gun and then ultimately go kill their spouse their children their neighbors their family members or strangers so it is my belief today that this health disparities debate is crucial and we should come away from here recognizing that obesity the issues of mental health and hiv aids can be with great investment researched for cures or cancer that proliferates in our community triple negative breast cancer legislation that i have put forward and have gotten passed about that impact but it is the gun violence that we are doing absolutely nothing about the disparities and the impact on minority communities is atrocious i want to close simply by saying the word or the acronym lgbtq community i want to say it over and over again because i think it is shameful that in our debate in our recognition of the tragedy of orlando that we dont acknowledge the horrific hate crime and the hatefulness against that community as i stand here that community is diverse and there are african americans who are lgbtq so i would ask that as we move forward this week we will be reminded of this hatefulness and we will have a cure we will be reminded of this violence and we will have a cure that cure first of all will be to restrain the use of assault weapons and these weapons of wartype bullets that men and women in the united states military say have no business on the streets of america i believe congresswoman that health disparities are an important wall and division to overcome i thank the gentlewoman for having this special order to ensure that we will confront these issues and try to save lives racial disparities refer to the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and or geographically defined population groups i want to focus on four areas of racial disparities in health that impact african americans that we can do something about 1 obesity 2 mental health 3 hiv aids and 4 gun violence african americans based on 2015 census data comprise 13 2 percent of the unitedstates population or about 42 million people socioeconomic status in turn is linked to mental health people who are impoverished homeless incarcerated or have substance abuse problems are at higher risk for poor mental health as the founder and chair of the congressional childrens caucus i am especially concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic among africanamerican youth more than 40 percent of african american teenagers are overweight and nearly 25 percent are obese the percentage of children aged 611 years in the united states who were obese increased from 7 percent in 1980 to nearly 18 percent in 2012 african american youth are consuming less nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables and are not getting enough physical exercise this combination has led to an epidemic of obesity which directly contributes to numerous deadly or lifethreatening diseases or conditions including the following hypertension dyslipidemia high cholesterol or high triglyceride levels type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease stroke gallbladder disease osteoarthritis asthma bronchitis sleep apnea and other respiratory problems cancer breast colon and endometrial when ethnicity and income are considered the picture is even more troubling african american youngsters from lowincome families have a higher risk for obesity than those from higherincome families efforts such as the lets move campaign by the first lady are pivotal to ensuring that communities are able to provide healthy snacks and food and encourage healthier decisions since the mid1970s the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased sharply for both adults and children nonhispanic blacks have the highest ageadjusted rates of obesity at 47 8 percent according to the cdc 37 6 percent of men and 56 9 percent of women twenty years and over are obese every year more than 40 million americans struggle with mental illness african american men are as likely as anyone else to have mental illness but they are less likely to get help racism continues to have an impact on the mental health of african americans negative stereotypes and attitudes of rejection have decreased but continue to occur with measurable adverse consequences historical and contemporary instances of negative treatment have led to a mistrust of authorities many of whom are not seen as having the best interests of african americans in mind according to the department of health and human services office of minority health adult blacks are 20 percent more likely to report serious psychological distress than adult whites adult blacks living below poverty are two to three times more likely to report serious psychological distress than those living above poverty adult blacks are more likely to have feelings of sadness hopelessness and worthlessness than are adult whites how african americans view mental health over generations is a major barrier to accessing mental health services and treatment in 1996 mha commissioned a national survey on clinical depression the survey explored the barriers preventing americans seeking treatment and gauged overall knowledge of and attitudes toward depression this survey revealed that 63 percent of african americans believe that depression is a personal weakness this is significantly higher than the overall survey average of 54 percent only 31 percent of african americans believed that depression was a health problem african americans were more likely to believe that depression was normal than the overall survey average 56 percent believed that depression was a normal part of aging 45 percent believed it was normal for a mother to feel depressed for at least two weeks after giving birth 40 percent believed it was normal for a husband or wife to feel depressed for more than a year after the death of a spouse many of these problems persist to this day as doctor william lawson of howard university and mhas district of columbia affiliate pointed out in an npr interview in 2012 many africanamericans have a lot of negative feelings about or not even aware of mental health services the mental health culture race and ethnicity supplement to the 1999 unitedstates surgeon generals report on mental health states the following africanamerican physicians are five times more likely than white physicians to treat africanamerican patients africanamerican patients who see africanamerican physicians rate their physicians styles of interaction as more participatory african americans seeking help for a mental health problem would have trouble finding african american mental health professionals in 1998 only 2 percent of psychiatrists 2 percent of psychologists and 4 percent of social workers said they were african americans the public mental health safety net of hospitals community health centers and local health departments are vital to many african americans especially to those in highneed populations african americans of all ages are underrepresented in outpatient treatment but overrepresented in inpatient treatment few africanamerican children receive treatment in privately funded psychiatric hospitals but many receive treatment in publicly funded residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed youth in 2012 there were an estimated 356 268 inmates with severe mental illnesses in unitedstates prisons and jails there were only 35 000 mentally ill individuals in state psychiatric hospitals the report the treatment of persons with mental illness in prisons and jails jails in 44 of the 50 states and the district of columbia a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital the report said african americans today are overrepresented in our jails and prisons people of color account for 60 percent of the prison population the stanford law school three strikes projects report stated that over the past 15 years the number of mentally ill people in prison in california has almost doubled in california 45 percent of state prison inmates have been treated for severe mental illness within the past year african americans also account for 14 percent of regular drug users but for 37 percent of drug arrests illicit drug use is frequently associated with selfmedication among people with mental illnesses in january 2014 the texas observer reported that of the 9 000 inmates in harris county jail more than 25 percent take medication for mental illness which means that the jail treats more psychiatric patients than all 10 of texas staterun public mental hospitals combined the passage of the affordable care act created access to health care for those who purchase health insurance and for the poor living in states that are participating in the medicaid component of the aca disparities can occur if physicians do not refer patients with signs of mental illness for proper treatment or if referred patients do not seek out treatment disparities in access to care and treatment for mental illnesses have also persisted over time as noted by the office of minority health only 8 7 percent of adult blacks versus 16 percent of adult whites received treatment for mental health concerns in 20072008 only 6 2 percent of adult blacks versus 13 9 percent of adult whites received medications for mental health concerns during 2008 while 68 7 percent of adult whites with a major depressive episode in 2009 received treatment only 53 2 percent of adult blacks did the affordable care act will have an impact on this gap by 2016 depression and other mental illness can be deadly if left untreated suicide is the third leading cause of death among african americans 15 to 24 years old untreated mental illness can also make african american men more vulnerable to substance abuse homelessness incarceration and homicide african americas are the racial ethnic group most affected by hiv in the united states according to the cdc 44 percent 19 540 of estimated new hiv diagnoses in the united states were among african americans who comprise 12 percent of the us population hiv aids are now the leading cause of death among african americans ages 25 to 44ahead of heart disease accidents cancer and homicide at the end of 2012 an estimated 496 500 african americans were living with hiv representing 41 percent of all americans living with the virus of african americans living with hiv around 14 percent do not know they are infected african americans accounted for an estimated 44 percent of all new hiv infections among adults and adolescents aged 13 years or older in 2010 despite representing only 12 percent of the unitedstates population hiv is a sexually transmitted disease or std it is also spread through intravenous drug use hiv infections spread through sharing of needles has declined with needle programs while the std rates of infection among african americans has increased at rate higher than any other ethnic group have their hiv status checkednot once but annually know the hiv status of sexual partner if hiv positive know how to get on antiviral medication 2 small pills taken each day and stay on them where to go for information if you or your partner is hiv positive in 2010 men accounted for 70 percent 14 700 of the estimated 20 900 new hiv infections among all adult and adolescent african americans the estimated rate of new hiv infections for african american men 103 6 100 000 population was 7 times that of white men twice that of latino men and nearly 3 times that of african american women in 2010 african american gay bisexual and other men who have sex with men represented an estimated 72 percent 10 600 of new infections among all african american men and 36 percent of an estimated 29 800 new hiv infections among all gay and bisexual men of those gay and bisexual men 39 percent 4 321 were young men aged 13 to 24 according to the cdc the numbers of new hiv diagnoses among african american women fell 42 percent between 2005 to 2014 but it is still high compared to women of other races ethnicities most new hiv infections among african american women 87 percent 5 300 are attributed to heterosexual contact in 2012 there were 72 010 texans living with hiv aids texas has the 10th highest number of hiv diagnoses in 2013 and ranks 18th for deaths from hiv currently 14 percent of the people living with hiv are undiagnosed and only 30 percent of the people with hiv are virally suppressed which means that 70 percent of the people who are ill are not on medication that can help limit their ability to infect others hiv is an unnecessarily disproportionate burden on the african american and latino community there is a wall of misinformation about the illness and an uncomfortable silence regarding the need to speak about the illness not only to the young but also the older persons when treatments were first developed in the 1990s they had lots of side effects that made patients very ill few talk about the advances in hiv treatment that now involve taking 2 small pills a day with the result leaving patients feeling healthy and able to engage in lifes normal activities the virus count for those who take their medication is so low that it often does not register in tests this does not mean that people are cured but it does mean that there is no reason not to get tested so that you know if you are in need of treatment anyone can become infectedso it is up to all of us to educate our families neighbors coworkers and friends about getting tested there are some insurance company practices that have a detrimental impact on the ability of people with hiv to enroll in qualified health insurance plans in states like texas that are not fully participating in the affordable care acts medicaid expansion this is especially problematic for hiv patients who are poor some states allow insurance carriers to post misleading or intentionally vague formularies on market place websites or excluding essential hiv medications from drug formularies and impressing high cost sharing out of pocket medication cost each month should be capped"]], "top_incorrect":

million americans at the same time we have heard all sorts of misinformation and distortions on this floor about planned parenthood which is an organization that provides women and their families with health care that provides cancer screenings and that provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of

households headed by immigrants relied on welfare compared to 30 percent of households headed by someone born in america thus driving up americas deficits and driving down americas ability to pay for

and the like paul ryan and i have a major disagreement on border security last week on october 22 paul ryan i and others met about his candidacy border security was discussed thereafter i handdelivered to paul ryan on the house floor at roughly 4 a letter that states paul struggling american families have lost more than 8 million job opportunities to illegal aliens all lower and middle income american workers have suffered from suppressed wages caused by the surge in both illegal alien and lawful immigrant labor supply your past record and current stance on immigration conflicts with the values of the americans i represent and causes great concern to me and the americans i represent yesterday during discussions about the speaker race you made two representations about immigration that stood out they are 1 it is unwise or unproductive to bring up any immigration legislation so long as barack obama is president 2 as speaker you will not allow any immigration bill to reach the house floor for a vote unless the immigration bill is supported by a majority of the majority of republican house members although you talk faster than i can write your words down i believe the above statements properly reflect what you said i send this letter to confirm that i accurately portray your remarks and that i may rely on them when the house floor vote for speaker occurs next week if my portrayal of your words errs in any respect please deliver to me before the gop conference meeting next week in which we are to conduct speaker elections a written communication correcting my errors if i do not receive such a communication from you then i will infer that you concur that my portrayal of your remarks is accurate and that i and the rest of the gop conference and the american people may rely on your words as i have written them i need your assurance that you will not use the speakers position to advance your immigration policies except when in accord with the two above statements because there is a huge gap between your immigration position and the wishes of the american citizens i represent your words yesterday constitute the needed assurance if your assurances as i have portrayed them are accurate then i am much more comfortable voting for you for speaker on the house floor and will do so absent something startling coming to my attention between now and the election which i dont anticipate if however you would use the speakers chair to advance an immigration belief system that is unacceptable to the americans i represent it will be very difficult for me to vote for you for speaker on the house floor to be clear i intend to publicly share this letter and your responding letter if any to help explain to my constituents why i voted as i did on the house floor in the speakers election thank you for considering the contents of this letter at roughly 5 20 paul ryan called me and stated that my letter accurately portrayed his immigration representations paul ryan confirmed that he meant what he said and would keep his word based on paul ryans representations and my trust that paul ryan is a man of his word i will vote for paul ryan

about the condition of our bridges and i have spent as i spoke earlier tonight a lot of time on that issue and in fact opposed the socalled stimulus bill because of the lack of investment in infrastructure particularly bridges but in this case i think perhaps there are some drafting errors in the amendment because it would preclude using these funds for rest areas which i think is problematic we have a crisis in terms of safe places for people to pull over both commercial truck drivers and individuals so i assume that the gentlewoman did not mean to preclude the use for rest areas also i dont know missouri well but i know in the west actually we have used these landscaping funds when we do new construction or significant construction to reduce maintenance costs because we have high wildfire danger in the west and if you can plant basically natives that will dominate that are not tall are not fireprone then you dont have to go in and mow two or three times a year in case some idiot throws their cigarette or cigar out of the car and starts a catastrophic forest fire so actually leaving the discretion to the states to use these funds in that way depending upon their conditions i think is important there have been a couple of instances in past bills where they went overboard with this kind of stuff i think the current restrictions on the program are suchand there is no mandate for the projects like resurfacing or anything else that is new construction and doing it as appropriate to state and including rest areas i think because of all those things i

the west i join my colleagues from utah and south dakota in support of this bill whenever we need to make an alteration to federal land whether it is the unitedstates forest service or the bureau of land management it frequently requires an actual bill to go through this entire processthe house the senate and the presidents signature i have had to do that a number of times and worked with our chairman on a number of bills important to my district now we have one that is not only of importance to south dakotans but important to veterans nationally this bill provides the veterans administration with 200 acres of federal land that is managed by the blm to expand the black hills national cemetery as we know national cemeteries are reserved for brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving in the military and it is important that we have space to meet those interment requests our veterans have served their country and they deserve to permanently rest in a cemetery that honors their sacrifice and commitment to the ideals that hold us together as a nation it so happens that the blm land that this bill would transfer abuts the current cemetery the blm and the va determined that only congress can provide the permanent jurisdiction transfer necessary for this expansion again that is not uncommon to actually bring bills before congress for land exchanges or border extensions that is why we are discussing this bipartisan commonsense bill and i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it expanding the black hills national cemetery is a noble and worthy cause it deserves our support i want to thank representative noem of south dakota for bringing this issue forward and for all of her hard work in guiding this bill through committee and hopefully shortly through the united states congress i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9841441959142685, 0.015855804085731506, 1, "oh my gosh first of all i want to thank mr carter it is testimonials like his that i have been hearing for the last 10 years since i have been in congress since i first went to an independent community pharmacist and you spoke with such great passion you are not alone as you know every single person like you in my district can tell me the same things that you have told me that is why i am on these bills that is why i am talking tonight about these issues i dont have the firsthand experience that you have as a pharmacist the closest i ever got to a pharmacy other than picking up my prescription drugs before i got into congress was when i was 16 and 17 years old i was a delivery boy for greenville pharmacy in sioux city iowa which by the way still exists since 1969 actually longer ago than that it was established but i would deliver prescription drugs to folks especially to the elderly who couldnt get out of their home who couldnt get to the pharmacy that is what this is about as you said it is about making sure ultimately and as a member of congress my job is to make sure that folks have access to affordable quality health care and that is where pharmacists play such an important role whether it is with medication therapy management or just simply consulting on an informal basis with someone who comes in and has a lot of different prescriptions and is confused by what to take and when to take them you folks really do such a wonderful job and if we lost that service as you said because of unfair business practices because of being squeezed by the big guysand it doesnt make any sense at all for that to happenthen patients would suffer in the end that is why i support both of these pieces of legislation two of these that have been mentioned already 244 which mr collins just mentioned again to make sure that everyone understands what it is about it is a measure that will increase transparency of generic drug payment rates in medicare part d and the federal employees health benefits program which serves a lot of folks as we know millions of folks and in the tricare pharmacy program by requiring those pbms one to provide pricing updates at least once every 7 days that doesnt seem like a lot to ask to me and i am sure it doesnt seem like a lot to ask for you number two disclose the sources used to update that mac list and to notify pharmacies of any changes in individual drug prices before these prices can be used as a basis of reimbursement this is complete common sense that is why there are republicans and democrats alike on this bill and i hope we can move this bill forward in iowa the state legislature did pass something not quite this comprehensive but something similar to this because in iowa folks understand what these pbms are doing and what those independent community pharmacists are up against and the second piece of legislation h r 592 that was already referenced again a bipartisan piece of legislation has got 218 cosponsors if memory serves me that is exactly the number we need if everybody votes to pass a piece of legislation in this body we could get it done if we brought it to the floor we could get it done maybe we ought to do a discharge petition sorry i dont mean to create too many anxieties there with you folks but nonetheless we have got to get this thing done it is about making sure that our pharmacists are able to continue to deliver the kind of quality health care look whatever we decide at the federal level when it comes to utilizing pharmacists to their full potential this legislation does stipulate that nothing will override state scope of practice laws as well because i know that a lot of folks in other professions have concerns about that that pharmacists are going to go too far well they are not going to if states have laws in place about scope of practice this legislation will not override that but it is about making sure as mr carter said and as mr collins would agree and others who have been so active on these issues would agreeit is about making sure that folks get the quality care that they need if we close down these pharmacies in these rural areas95 percent of the folks in iowa are within 5 miles of an independent community pharmacistif they close down those pharmacies those folks in my district who depend upon those pharmacies and those pharmacists are going

of this measure i am glad that mr poe said that is just the way it is because i agree it is just the way it is i agree with everything he says and i want to thank him and mr connolly for their work on this very timely resolution it is clear that russian president vladimir putin is doing everything in his power to steamroll the efforts of the unitedstates and our allies over many decades to build a europe that is whole free and at peace and we shouldnt forget that the illegal occupation of crimea and parts of eastern ukraine isnt the first time he has trampled on his neighbors territorial integrity last month we marked 8 years since russian troops moved into georgia where they remain to this day now i believe keeping georgia out of nato in 2008 was a terrible mistake and indeed thenpresident medvedev cited the alliances failure to put out the welcome mat for georgia as a signal that russia needed to push across the border yet even with its sovereignty fractured for eight years georgia will soon write another chapter in its history of freedom and democracy by holding parliamentary elections we went to a celebrationand i believe mr poe was therecelebrating the 25th anniversary of freedom from communism by georgia your heart really has to go out to the georgian people and what they have been able to accomplish under very very adverse circumstances georgia was a part of the soviet union for so many years it was clear that they didnt wish to be but they were forced to be then when the soviet union collapsed georgia of course was an independent country and declared so but that wasnt good enough for mr putin so the resolution we are considering today reaffirms the commitment of the united states to our partners in georgia we believe that georgias territorial integrity should be restored just as with ukraine we do not recognize russias occupation of parts of that country as legitimate and we never will i think we have to state that again the russian occupation of parts of georgia is illegal and georgia should remain whole and free and the russians ought to get out we view georgias democracy and vibrant society as a beacon in an increasingly challenging part of the world and we continue to believe that the door should be open to georgia to work with us i continue to believe that the door should remain open to georgia for both
