balance the republican budget includes a deficit for 2006 of 372 billion and a deficit for 2007 of 348 billion these deficiti mean that under republican policies the five largest deficits in history will have occurred in five consecutive years over the next five years 20072011 the budget resolution calls for deficits totaling 1 1 trillion since this administration took office it has requested and the congress has provided four increases in the statutory debt ceiling totaling 3 trillion under this budget by 2011 the statutory debt will increase by another 2 3 trillion for a total increase of 5 3 trillion it will leave the statutory debt at a record level of 11 3 trillion the presidents reckless economic policies have doubled our nations debt further i am concerned by the amount of the debt that has been accumulated by foreign bank individuals and governments in 1980 17 percent of the federal debt held by the public was in foreign hands by 2006 45 percent of the debt held by the public was ovned overseas unfortunately this trend seems to be increasing rapidly during the past year approximately 90 percent of the debt we have accumulated has been purchased by foreign banks individuals and governments i support the representative john spratts alternative budget which would reach balance in 2012 the spraft budget also has smaller deficits than the republican budget and accumulates less debt by contrast the republican budget never returns to balance and even refuses to show how big its deficits will be after 2011 the spratt budget backs the twosided payasyougo paygo budget enforcement rules that require that the cost of any new mandatory spending or revenue legislation be fully offset during the 1990s twosided paygo rules played a critical role in turning record deficits to record surpluses the spratt budget also requires a separate vote to increase the debt limit and prohibits using fasttrack reconciliation procedures to make the deficit worse the republican budget cuts appropriations for domestic services by 9 4 billion relative to current services and by 3 2 billion below the level passed by republicans in the senate meanwhile the budget continues medicare subsidies close to 60 billion for managed care providers of medicare even though they are supposed to save medicare money not cost more the resolution also includes 228 billion over five years for additional tax cuts part of a 3 trillion tenyear republican tax cut agenda the republican resolution cuts appropriated funding for education and related programs below current services providing the same inadequate level as provided by the president for 2007 that repub ican level cuts funding for the department of education by 2 2 billion below last years comparable level and eliminates 42 education programs the spratt budget provides 4 6 billion more than the republican budget for education appropriations and over five years provides 45 3 billion more than the republican resolution the spratt budget rejects the deep cuts proposed by the republican budget and preserves programs such as vocational education perkins loans safe and drugfree schools state grants and the gearup college readiness program the spratt budget also makes a down payment on college affordability by cutting student loan interest rates after a temporary one year gain the republican budget after five years cuts funding for veterans health care by 6 0 billion below current services the spratt budget includes 6 0 billion more than the republican budget over five years for veterans health care the spratt budget also rejects the increase on health care fees on military retirees who are enrolled in tricare the republican budget asks additional sacrifices from those who have served and sacrificed for our country the spratt budget rejects the misguided republican policies and keeps our commitment to our veterans the republican budget cuts funding for health by 18 1 billion below current services over five years the same insufficient level provided by the president the republican level means cuts to priorities such as the centers for disease control 18 of 19 institutes at the national institutes of health and rural health activities the spratt budget provides 18 billion more over five years to fund health priorities cut by the republican budget including medical research at nih and graduate medical education for childrens hospitals the spraft budget also takes steps to address the problems with theimplementation of the medicare prescription drug benefit including extending the may 15 signup period through the end of year and protecting seniors from any enrollment penalties the spratt budget also takes steps to help the uninsured and creates a reserve fund to increase medicare payments to physicians which are currently scheduled to be cut for the environment and natural resources this republican budget imposes a 25 0 billion cut relative to current services over the next five years and imposes a 2 9 billion cut for next year alone this is the same level as the presidents budget which cuts funding for the environmental protection agency including the clean water state revolving fund the army corps of engineers and the national park service the house republican budget resolution actually makes the deficit worse offers no plan to bring the budget back to balance and adds to the growing burden of the national debt meanwhile the republican budget makes harmful cuts to critical services for the american people including education veterans services health and environmental protection i ask my colleagues to oppose this budget and support the spratt alternative budget"], [0.0020805001258850098, 0.997919499874115, 1, "we appreciate the opportunity once again to come to the floor of the house of representatives as the 30something working group myself along with kendrick meek mr meek from florida and also ms wasserman schultz from florida we have been coming here now for a couple of years talking about the condition of the united states our fiscal situation our investment situation or lack of investment in the united states of america and also what we believe is the democraticf caucus and leader peloij and steny hoyer and the issues that we are trying to put forward it has been a very interesting week here for the democratic caucus we had a wonderful guest george lucas the famous writer director producer of the great star wars movies and he was here to talk about the innovation agenda that the democratiq party is beginning to put forward and we have an innovation agenda to keep america competitive in the 21st century as we look at what has been happening here in the united states this kind of breaks down into two or three separate categories one if we want to be a strong country we have got to start here at home and we got to start making the investments here in the united statep research and development education health care alternative energy technologies must start here and we must begin to grow our economy here if we are going to be of any good to anyone else here in the world unfortunately our friends across the aisle on the republican side have failed miserably in their attempt to try to balance the budget here in the united states of america we have as citizens of this country regardless of what political party you belong to we have as a country an 8 2 trillion national debt 8 2 trillion dollars each citizen in this country owes 27 000 to our national debt if a baby is born today that baby owes 27 000 to the united states government to help us pay our debt if you are a senior citizen you owe 27 000 to the united states government and if we keep going down the path that we have been on and here it is 8 2 trillion as of valentines day 2006 and your share of the national debt is 27 500 we have a real situation in the united states of america so not only do we owe this not only does each person owe that what do we do so if we are running a 400 billion annual deficit or 300 billion what do we do to fund business in the united states of america we have got to go out and borrow the money and this president in the first 4 years of his term borrowed more money from foreign interests than every single administration prior to his in the last 224 years this president borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign interests in 4 years more than every other president before him is that making america stronger mr speaker i do not think it is i think it weakens our country and here it is this president in a republican house and a republican senate has borrowed 1 05 trillion from 2001 to 2005 and all of these presidents did not borrow as much from foreign interests as this one has and that puts us that puts us at a position of weakness because guess who we are borrowing the money from to pay the bills we borrow some from unitedstates interests but this is a chart that outlines who else we are borrowing this money from 682 billion we have borrowed from japan 249 billion we have borrowed from china 67 8 billion from opec are you kidding me we are borrowing money from opec to help fund and plug the hole in our annual deficits here meanwhile they are making money hand over fist this is a very dangerous situation that we are in because here is the end result here is where the rubber meets the road as we all take out loans to pay for our homes or our cars or our kids education unfortunately you cannot just borrow the money at zero percent interest you have got to pay interest on the money you borrow so the interest on 8 2 trillion is a lot of money so what does that mean for our annual payments that we have to make just on the interest this chart is the 2007 budget in billions of dollars this big red bar that gets up to 230 billion is what we are going to pay in the 2007 budget projected on interest on the debt just the interest we are not paying it down we are just paying the interest on it and this nice lavender bar that barely gets up over 50 billion is what we are going to spend on education and then homeland security and then veterans the irresponsible policies of this administration put our fiscal house in disorder because we are spending so much money on just paying the interest on the money we owe the chinese and the japanese and the opec countries that is a great deal for those countries great deal for them but what about us a stronger america starts here at home so until we fix this problem there is no issue we can go on addressing because it straps our hands behind our back because we want to make investments in education research and development pell grants to lower the cost of college tuition put research money into figuring out an alternatie energy source so we are not dependent on some of these opec countries but check this out this is the interest on the debt that i just showed this is what we could spend every day in this country if we did not have to pay all this interest on the debt we could invest 1 million a day into every congressional district i represent a district in northeast ohio youngstown ohio akron ohio niles ohio warren ohio portage county kent state university is in my district this is an older area in the northeast of the great state of ohio the great buckeye state 365 million i could have to go back to this area and invest in the schools head start all kinds of other different things just from my district and every other member in here would get 365 million a tremendous difference give it to the chinese banks the chiinese government give it to the japanese banks the japanese government give it to opec or give it to the kids who are trying to go to school in youngstown ohio of which 80 percentlive in poverty that go to youngstown city schools i know what i would like to choose some other things here we could provide health care to 79 925 more veterans if we would not have to pay the interest on the debt like in the late 1990s when we made the very difficult decision here and i am glad the gentleman from florida is joining us for this point a very difficult decision in 1993 when president clinton got into office we were running budget deficit after budget deficit every year and our democratic house and a democratic senate with a democratic president balanced the budget in 1993 without one republican vote i am hot saying some republicans would not vote for it now but at that time when the heat was on without one republican vote and it led to balanced budgets surpluses as far as the eye could see investments into education hope scholarship the whole nine yards and the greatest 6conomic expansion in the history of this country more important the private sector because interest rates were low the private sector was able to go out and create over 20 million new jobs we cannot create jobs here in government that is not our duty that is not our responsibility this is the chart reagan reagan reagan bush bush bush all in the red and clinton in the late 1990s after the 1993 budget was im plemented we started having surpluses in the late 1990s projected out as far as the eye could see because of fiscal discipline that is what our job is here balance the budget keep interest rates low invest in the education and research like this country has always done and the private sector will join and take over some other things if we did not have to pay the interest on the debt we could enroll 60 000 kids into head start you want to talk about being compassionate you want to talk about if you practice the christian faith being a christian i think somewhere that means making sure we can invest into those poor districts those poor children and i am so glad that mr meek is joining us because we started out here and that we being me talking about the impact of the budget deficit and the fiscal situation that we are in right now and the damage that it is causing to the american economy and the lack of investment because we are paying the interest on the debt to many of these countries overseas so thank you very much fot

corruption of these individuals being able to get access into this institution and into the executive branch to be able to get what they want i want to drive the point on here i want to make sure this is crystal clear it has to be crystal the bottom line is the only way that we will be able to have a paradigm shift not only in thinking but in policy and action on behalf of the american people and unless the american people like you say the majority they do not have to be the majority the american people can make that change they can say that we are willing to allow the democrats to lead so that we can hopefully start taking care of some of these issues that we have to take care of here at home with our troops in iraq and afghanistan and throughout the world so that we can get the respect of not only the world but our country our own country veterans they signed up for all the right reasons allowing us to salute one flag as we see it now are being asked to do more financially

are only open on wednesday now but meanwhile we have individuals we have the president every time he gets a chance he is talking about let us make the tax cuts permanent for people who are not even asking for it so this is very simple this speech on what the majority republicans say well trust us we know what we are doing we showed the letter from secretary snow i think we already know this we did not write this letter the guy has said the fifth time the secretary is saying we will not be able to operate the government that is one letter here is the other one here fortytwo presidents this president and republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion but better yet saying let us make a bad idea permanent let us drive this number up let us put a two here instead of a one it does not make

lobbyists thriving i never blame the special interests for what happens here but i am going to tell you right now they have a tax shelter right now where 100 billion in unitedstates taxpayer dollars are not going into the coffers because they have an offshore deal with this administration and with this majority meanwhile we are sitting around here trying to figure out how our veterans are going to get health care meanwhile we are trying to figure how small businesses will be able to afford health care for everyday americans to be able to buy into and meanwhile we have troops still without body armor and the things they need to be able to fight on behalf of this country so we ask everyday americans to go out there and suck it up meanwhile the majority the republican majority based on incompetence some may say corruption in some cases as it relates to the white house i mean every day i am sorry every day we turn on the television what is new what is going on at the white house what is being held back from the american people what is being held back from the congress who came to the hill today and conflicted a story that they told just months ago about the fiscal outlook on the

2000 this congress has racked up more than 3 trillion in new debt mind you at a time in which in 2000 the american budget was running a surplus but in that time we have run deficits on average a little north of 400 billion and we have added 3 trillion to the nations debt how did we do it we have tried to fight two wars with four tax cuts and this congress has served as an atm to the special interests showering them with billions in tax breaks and handouts the prescription drug bill is a classic example where we are now adding close to what the american people were once told would be a 400 billion prescription drug bill is now worth 800 billion and 139 billion in extra profits to the pharmaceutical companies over 10 years yet all of the sudden when it comes to rebuilding the lives of our fellow citizens in new orleans and on the coast we are talking about cutting education health care areas of environment and energy for the rest of america 50 billion and all the while we are trying to do that this congress under a republican majority wants to shower the wealthiest 1 percent those who earn over 200 000 with more tax cuts and more debt yet what are we saying to the rest of america you are going to get cuts in education health care environment energy national security areas homeland in the area of police yet the interesting thing while all of this is happening here in the united states we are trying to turn ourselves into a pretzel trying to cut 50 billion from our education and health care what are we doing in iraq at this time what are we doing in iraq we are actually renovating and building 110 primary health carb centers vaccinating 3 2 million iraqi children rehabilitating 2 700 schools training 36 000 secondary school teachers in iraq we fund 3 120

the korean war thought of the interstate highway system president kennedy at the ending days of vietnam was thinkingof putting a man on the moon at this time when we are thinking about as we have always thoughttowards the end of the war every presidentroosevelt had the g i billevery president said how do we bring this peace home to america and how do we make sure we invest in america so we reap the benefits as a country only this president at this time in this war is thinking about rebuilding another country while cutting back in the united states president lincoln thought of the land grant colleges we are going to cut pell grants president eisenhower thought of the interstate highway system president kennedy thought of putting a man on the moon what are we going to do we are going to cut amtrak in this country this is not the way to invest in america you want to make the 21st century the american century like the 20th century you have to invest in america what have you done you have turned the budget into a pretzel all to protect tax cuts for the wealthiest of americans theyare patriots too when it comes to americas future every american must have skin in the game when it comes to rebuilding the coast that is the families and the communities of new orleans mississippi and alabama the choice shouldnot be cutting pell grants and college loans cutting student nutrition programs cutting health care for our elderly and most vulnerable as a way to pay for that yet at the same time this congress has allocated 445 billion to iraq and it is going to go north to 600 billion unaccounted for unpaid for all debt the american taxpayer has to pay for and what are the americans going to get for it cuts in education cuts in the students loan programs cuts in health care

not and america does not deserve gas prices at 3 a gallon energy prices this winter are going up by 50 percent inflation is increasing at its fastest ate 15 percent what are you providing americans you are providing them protection for those who earn 200 000 or more and the rest of america gets cuts in its investment for its future yet you have told tuie iraqis why do we not give iraq some cuts in their investments and provide america the schools we are talking about in iraq i have no problem investing in iraqs future what i have a problem with is the cuts in americas future that you want to make here we can do better for america we can definitely do better a stronger america around the world begins at home you are making the wrong choices for americas future i hope as we deal with this

put the paper on the desk fast enough before they rubber stamp it when you start talking about the fact that by the constitution we are supposed to carry out oversight that is not a value of the republican majority li 1915 oversight of what no see they are too busy taking care of the special interests you would think that some members were more concerned with trying to make sure that special interests got what they needed because we do not want to forget the k street project where you pay to play and you get access into this republican majority house so when you look at the rubberstamping of what has happened here i cannot help but have this stamp here because that is how we got here but what is very very unfortunate is the fact that we have ourselves in a situation in a fiscal situation that is going to take a generation almost to recover from we have ourselves in a situation in iraq we do not know how many years it may take for us to recover from that and i am using the presidents words now we have ourselves in a situation where the white house now wants to invite members over to have tea and cookies right now and trying to be niceynice to say we want to hear from you now but we have men and women caught in the crossfire and we have millions and billions of dollars that have been wasted and stolen in iraq i am going to say stolen because of the rubberstamp republican majority anything that the administration sends down how can we rubberstamp it matter of fact i think the republican majority walks around with a little mini rubber stamp in their pocket saying oversight this is the way you want it and how you want it the american people have to send a very strong message to this republican majority here in the congress that we have three branches of government for a reason not two branches of government that deals with legislation and policy but three branches we have the judicial branch that is separate and aside but when you look at the legislative branch we are supposed to carry out oversight only a couple of members of the republican majority actually gets that and tries to practice it but they are in a superminority and so the reason why we come to the floor is to shed light on the lack of oversight when it was a democratic house and a democratic white house there was oversight cajl bill clinton up and ask him i think we know that republican majority the reason why you are going to see people around here scratching and fighting and begging and trying to do anything and throwing out the sods and trying to get press releases out because the white house is very very concerned that they will no longer be able to send legislation to the unitedstates house of representatives and that it passes through committees that may have a half a meeting on it and come to the floor not allowing democrats to do anything to improve the legislation because they are too busy rubberstamping the process and it will disrupt that it is all about power and influence and i can tell you right now the republican majority has gone too far with this because that is the reason why we are in the situation we are in now and they are known they have to shake it and they know it and they deserve the rubber stamp because that is what they have been doing since the president has been in the white house i am coming to ms jacksonlee i just want to give you a perfect example of what happens in a rubberstamp congress exhibit a how can you borrow 1 05 trillion in 4 years i do not even know how that can be achieved in 4 years the republican majority has handed president bush he cannot do it on his own we have the republican congress right under him from 2001 to 2005 1 05 trillion now here is the other kicker that comes in and with interest fortytwo presidents 224 years 224 years 42 presidents were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion i rest my case on that i rest my case on the fact that the republican majority has given the bush

american people have awakened all of the polls show it the american people are glued in to what is happening here in washington and right they should be i want to start off by saying that so that individuals who are tuning in who would like to know just what are the blue dogs more than anything else we pride ourselves on being first and foremost good stewards of the taxpayers dollars we provide the sterling leadership in the democratic party for responsible fiscal responsibility for 5 years we in the blue dog coalition have been begging and pleading that this congress develop a plan to pay as you go mr speaker 5 years ago when the clinton administration left office we had a surplus billions and billions and billions of dollars were left in surplus now 5 years later under the bush administration we are trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars in debt make no mistake about it our debt and our deficit is the number one problem and issue facing the survival and the future of our democracy and we are concerned about this national debt but at a time when we are expressly concerned about it and pushing forward for responsible measures onthe democratic side it is the height of hypocrisy it is the height of being insensitive it is the height of indeed smoke and mirrors for this republicanled congress and this republican president to under the guise of giving a tax cut for billionaires and millionaires across this country say he wants to cut spending cut spending of the most vital services the most important needs in this country as a matter of fact in the history of this country in this 20th century we have just been hit with the worst hurricane season in modern times katrina was the worst that anybody can remember billions and billions and billions of dollars worth of damage an entire city entire region almost totally destroyed over 250 000 american citizens without homes we all remember those pictures down in new orleans in the flood our hearts went out to those people well our hearts must continue to go out to those people and the reason it is the height of hypocrisy is here is the president of the united states and this republican controlled congress who says that they want to offset a 70 billion tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country on the backs of those poor victims of this hurricane on the front page of the washington post this morning the answer from fema is to throw 150 000 american citizens who have become homeless on the street the answer from the white house and the answer from this congress has been to cut the very programs that will help these victims the most the most effective programs that have helped them has been the food stamp program and under this budget this republican held congress and this president proposes to cut food stamps by 850 million not only at a time when we have people who are homeless without jobs without hope but according to the agriculture department just this year alone we have added 2 million more citizens to the hunger roles the republicans answer cut the very program that has been designed to help them by 850 billion medicaid under this budget planned by the republicans and president bush they want to cut medicaid by 12 billion when 45 million americans mostly senior elderly citizens are going without any kind of health insurance and our farmers cut them by 2 billion farmers who have been devastated by the flood who have been hurt by the flood now is not the time to cut the farmers and our veterans 3 billion lord knows we have not been doing right by our veterans we have cut them we have cut them we have cut them and the presidents answer is cut the veterans this republican congresss is to cut the veterans is that not a reason why they have had difficulty in getting the votes why they have had to pull the bill last week and the american people need to wake up and understand and put the calls in to your republican congressman to let them know that america does not want to cut the basic services for the needy while trying to add a 70 billion tax cut for the millionaires and the billionaires they do not need the money but the children do this budget will cut childrens nutrition by 2 billion and 5 billion in child support heating oil is cut at a time when the oil companies are getting record profits and their execputives are sitting fast student loans 14 billion at a time when going to college costs so much there will be tens of thousands of american children who will not go to college if this republican budget reconciliation bill passes that is why this is so important that is why it is important listen to me america and if you know other people tell them to tune in we are here to tell you the facts this blue dog coalition is one of the most influential groups on capitol hill and the reason why is because people trust us we have earned that we have earned that distinction folks like charlie stenholm john tanner they have pioneered and set the curve respect across party lines respect across this country the blue dog coalition we are speaking the truth tonight william shakespeare said it well when he wrote that great play julius caesar when he said et tu brutus yours is the meanest cut of all and that is what these republicans are doing in this bill it is mean it is cold and it is wrong and the american people deserve better and we are going to give them better so mr ross and my fellow blue dogs we are here tonight to speak the truth we are here tonight to let the american

with it qur job is not the daytoday operation of the war in iraq it is our job to bring in this presidency making sure that we are accountable to those troops that are on the ground and our mission the bottom line is what is our mission i mean these are the individuals that gave this congress bad information and then the minute that they gave the congress bad information got away with it there were weapons of mass destruction thefn apologize well we got bad information on weapons of mass destruction i am sorry you know hey it happens but individuals have died now we have iraqi troops that

america and next thing you know this issue makes it to the heartland or sioux city iowa or whatever the case the people may say well that is a coastal issue that is not a coastal issue it is an american issue e 2320 and they have been allowed to do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it because this congress hasnt reined them in i am going to close in 1 second but i just want to also point out madam speaker since we are pointing out a few things here that we have turned on the lights here in the chamber this whole dubai thing and the republicans marching around we stopped that from happening we blocked that deal well guess what there were a couple of votes before that where theytried to block it but procedurally they blocked the democrats from doing that it is not who blocked it it is about how we got there how did an under secretary level individual make this kind of decision the outsourcing of american security it happens every day ms wasserman schultz and i can tell you this we are standing up to the president no you are not standing up to the president but guess what when all of america is standing on this side of the line and saying are you representing us or who are you representing are we standing upfor dubai what did the president say i got a little confused there members i am sorry the president said well we have got to keep our word what about keeping our word to the american people on security and health care and all those things hetalked about during the canpaign and all the republican members won the majority because they said trust us on security trust us on fiscal responsibility dont get me started on fiscal responsibility it is almost like the guy running from the back of the class who is an f student who says i want to be the valedictorian of the class because i say that i am did not work did not study did not do the things that he needed to do to be the top person in the class but better yet because they say it that makes it right what does this mean mr delahunt this means if the american people see fit that the democrats are in charge of the congress that the white house will not be making statements and saying well we have said it publicly so that means you cant do anything about it republican congress and if folks want to talk about a democratic plan in iraq it is accountability it is making sure we take these nobid contracts and put them on top of the table and really get down to the treason why we are still in iraq i am just talking about what i am talking about mr delahunt i am not saying there are some shady deals but there are a number of articles that are out that ire pointing to this every day this stuff is coming out and i think it is very very important that we focus in on that"],

stagnant for the last 3 years now families can add energy to the list of outofcontrol costs to their family budget gas is around 3 bucksa gallon utilities are now predicting families could pay as much as 70 percent more to heat their homes this winter natural gas prices are so high the energy department is predicting the average family will pay 350 more this winter than last winter home heating oil used by many in the northeast and midwest is skyrocketing but while american families struggle with skyhigh energy bills oil and gas companies face a totally different problem too much cash for example exxon mobil recently reported their profits increased by 75 percent their revenues 100 billion shell oil earnings 68 percent up phillips 89 percent up b p amoco 34 percent rise in quarterly earnings american families are struggling with massive energy bills that cut into their living expenses their college costs and their health care costs while energy companies are reaping huge huge profits henry hubble a senior vice president at exxon mobil said you have got to let the marketplace work i agree with the executive from exxon mobil let the marketplace work but here is where we disagree when they had an energy bill down on this floor the oil companies got a 14 billion taxpayerfunded corporate welfare giveaway to do oil and gas drilling around this country they got 14 billion for companies making record profits that is what we call corporate welfare if they want the marketplace to work give the taxpayers back their 14 billion we should be not be subsidizing their business plans taxpayers are not in the business of helping companies making revenue runs at 100 billion a quarter where profits are up 89 percent the congress not democrats but the republicans in congress are cutting college loans by 14 billion they are cutting nutritional programs for 40 000 kids and they are cutting kids health care yet what have they held sacrosanct 14 billion to exxon mobil my view is what corporate america needs in the energy business is a little free market medicine we have seen nothing but corporate welfare around here in subsidizing the energy industry and it is high time they get off the dole and started running their own business plan and stop asking the taxpayers to fund them the only reason they do that around here is because since 1980 the big oil companies have contributed 220 million to the republican candidates for congress senate the presidency and their party they have gotten a 14 billion return you cannot get an investment return like that on wall street it is 200 percent on their investment that they have gotten this congress has given big oil 14 billion in tax subsidies if that is not bad enough there is a refinery bill where we ended up giving them another 2 billion that they did not even ask for so with oil running at basically 3 a gallon at the gas pump not only do consumers have to pay inflated prices to big oil at the gas pump but on april 15 they get a bill because they have given them 14 billion in taxpayerfunded corporate welfare so they can do one thing execute their business plans well i am suggesting they start doing a little more free enterprise in executing their business plans and stop relying on the taxpayers of america who are struggling with skyhigh energy prices skyhigh health dare costs and skyhigh college tuition costs just trying to struggle to make ends meet what congress would actually cut home heating assistance to our most needy citizens yet give exxon mobil and the other big energy companies 16 million a republican congress but of course this should make sense to all of us who have seen what goes on around here when the speakers gavel comes down that gavel is intended to open the peoples house not the auction house what has happened around here lately when it comes to big oil companies is we auction off the american people and their future when it comes to the pharmaceutical companies who gave 132 million they ended up vith 135 billion in additional profit when we did the prescription drug bill when we had a 5 billion problem to fix with europe on the corporate trade tax issue what did this republican congress do of course 150 billion tax giveaway to corporate america to solve a 5 billion problem only using their type of math do you work like that pharmaceutical companies big oil companies corporate special interests selling away america the speakers gavel is intended to open the peoples house not the auction house and the united states congress had better start acting like the peoples house because lately we are giving christies a run for its money around here you cannot gfve out money fast enough to the energy companies who are making massive profits and on the other hand cut those who are most needy you cannot have a policy in the country that says to oil companies who are reaping huge profits and that is their business but we should not subsidize their business we are going to give you more while cutting those who are struggling these are not the values of this country these are not the values of the demcbratic party and thank god they are not the values of the american people we need a change we need new priorities that focus on americas future we can do better and it is high time we turn the peoples house back to the american people"],

than the one that saves 27 5 billion more in interest than the republican budget i cannot imagine that my good friend on the floor of the house would not welcome the opportunity of putting that interest into the needs of the american people we need affordable housing we can go to any city any rural community and not see people standing in line to access affordable housing section 8 touchers which allows affordable housing for families of four and five and six hardworking american there are 25 000 people on the list in houston texas alone millions of people are still on the list because they do not have affordable housing f 1245 finally i congratulate the gentleman from virginia and the gentleman from north carolina on this budget because it also invests in homeland security with all of the talk of the republican budget they do not fund immigration and customs officers they do not fund border patrol officers to secure our borders and provide for internal security the cbc budget does the obc budget puts 150 million in for border and customs needs this is a strong budget for the american people vote for the congressional black caucus budget save 27 5 billion in interest i think you will like that in your pocket and in your savings account i rise today to offer another choice to those americans who are disheartened by the current budget proposal being offered by this republican congress today we offer them the choice of accepting the congressional black caucuss cbc alternative budget truly it is the budget of hope and compromise it is the budget that closes the disparities in americas communities the cbc alternative budget provides both social and economic equality for americans instead of allowing the richest americans to pay fewer taxes at the expense of vital programs needed by lower and middle class americans surely this administration and the republican leadership in congress will pay lip service to the needs of these americans but this budget does more it demonstrates in writing that under our current budgetary situation it is possible to maintain necessary social programs while practicing true fiscal responsibility the cbc alternative budget is particularly strong in its support of educational programs the greatest key we possess to close disparities in our society this administration and the majority in this congress promised to leave no child behind but clearly they have reneged on their promise the republican budget eliminates 48 education programs that receive 4 3 billion this year these eliminations include wiping out 1 3 billion for all vocational education programs 522 million for all education technology programs and 29 million for all civic education programs the republican budget eliminates other large programs including the even start family literacy program 225 million and state grants for safe and drugfree schools and communities 437 million in fact the presidents budget cuts 2006 funding for the department of education by 1 3 billion below the amount needed to maintain purchasing power at the current level and by 530 million below the 2005 enacted level of 56 6 billion this is the first time since 1989 that an administration has submitted a budget that cuts the departments funding the cbc alternative budget in stark contrast provides a much needed boost of 23 9 billion to education and training including 2 5 billion for school construction the cbc alternative fully funds the fiscal year 2006 authorization level for no child left behind nclb and provides for an expansion of the head start program in addition the cbc alternative doubles federal funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions again closing the disparities often witnessed in higher education in that regard the cbc alternative increases the pell grant allotment for college students because as we all know a mind any mind is a terrible thing to waste clearly the cbc alternative emphasizes this ideal more than the republican budget resolution few things are more important to americans than their home and their communities while the president and this republican congress take steps to make it harder for average americans to reach homeownership the cbc alternative invests heavily in this vital sector it funds home ownership initiatives that help families build real wealth in the city of houston alone we have 25 000 people waiting on a list to obtain affordable housing these homes will provide them the stability and equity to build their lives and eventually achieve their own prosperity we shame ourselves when we deny them the opportunity to do so the cbc alternative also restores 1 122 billion for vital community block grants which were gutted in the republican budget resolution without the ability to build up our communities how can we change peoples realities without community development we allow these disparities to continue unabated the cbc alternative budget does not remove any money from the overall defense and homeland security budget instead it takes 7 7 billion out of the ballistic missile defense program which has so far proven to be a failure and redirects the money to additional support for the troops in iraq homeland security needs and veterans programs and benefits among the items of support for the troops in iraq is 75 million of body armor personal support equipment and other protective gear for troops and vehicle armor all of which we know the troops are in urgent need of the cbc alternative provides an additional 2 05 billion for homeland security including funds for improving rail and port security which have always been high risk targets for attack this alternative budget provides 4 65 billion for veterans funding so that when our brave men and women return home from fighting the war on terror they will know that their nation is ready and willing to take care of them the cbc alternative also funds the important sector of immigration as the ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration border security and claims i worked with the cbc to get funding for 150 million for immigration and customs enforcement ice agents and border patrol agents truly we are undermanned in this vital sector in addition as a member of the house science committee i worked with the cbc to fund an additional 500 million for general science space and development and support the research and development efforts of nasa the national science foundation nsf the national institute of standards and technologies nist and the department of energy in addition to research and development the cbc alter native also supports additional safety measures for the space shuttle program which should be at the forefront of nasas efforts after the columbia space shuttle tragedy space and science represent yet another way to eliminate disparities through knowledge and discovery this cbc alternative budget is proof positive that we can properly fund social programs while still paying down more of the hational debt than the republican budget again i say that this budget represents hope instead of the despair we feel when looking at the republican budget resolution it id a hope for ending the disparities that continue to divide us and keep us to this day from achieving our full potential as a nation"],

that is a statement of our values that is balanced in terms of our priorities and balanced fiscally he has always conducted the process of creating a budget in a way that has ififormed members has done so with great dignity and great fairness and great respect for all points of view i wish we would all join in acknowledging the great leadership of the gentleman from south carolina our ranking member on the committee on the budget in 1994 the first item in the republicans contract with america was the fiscal responsibility act republicans pledged to restore fiscal responsibility to an outofcontrol congress requiring them to live under the same budget constraints as families and businesses more than 10 years later an outoftouch republican majority has taken fiscal responsibility to a new low it is clear that in the 10 years the republicans have become addicted to deficits the budget deficit for this year is a record 427 billion the february budget deficit my colleagues of 114 billion for the month of february a deficit of 114 billion is the highest monthly deficit ever and the first time it ever went over 100 billion in one month in 2001 president clinton left president bush with a projected 5 6 trillion in surplus in just 4 years president bush has turned that record surplus into a record deficit of nearly 4 trillion a 10 trillion swing in the wrong direction make no mistake these deficits are the direct result of republican policies huge tax cuts for the wealthy a refusal to pay as you go poor planning for a war of choice in iraq the list goes on and on and on america is awash in red ink because of republican budget irresponsibility tragically this republican budget is yet another missed opportunity to return to fiscal discipline not only is this budget fiscally irresponsible the republican budget is dishonest it does not cut the deficit in half as republicans claim in fact it makes the deficit worse republicans leave out the realistic cost of the war the cost of expiring tax provisions the true cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax and the cost of any changes to social security the budget is dishonest in another way it fails to show any def7 icit figures at all after 2010 in our new partnership for americas future democrats have made a commitment to honor the value of accountability including eliminating deficit spending and holding those in power accountable for their actions with a high 6thical standard democrats support honest accountable budgets that pay as you go the democratic alternative offered by the gentleman from south carolina achieves balance by 2012 the republican budget never reaches balance it heaps tons of debt onto our children and grandchildren and it will eventually lower our standard of living we cannot let that happen to our country and on top of all of that the republican budget undermines the solvency of social security while republicans ignore the real crisis of ballooning budget deficits the president falsely claims there is a crisis in social security but just because the president says it does not make it so he is simply wrong according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office social securitys trust fund will grow every year until a high of 8 3 trillion in 2032 and continues to be solvent until 2052 i want to call your attention to this chart my colleagues the left bar represents the deficit in the general fund between now and 2035 a staggering 15 trillion the bush administration has taken us onto atrajectory of reckless budgeting that will take us to 15 trillion in deficit in 2035 from 2006 to 2035 15 trillion in deficit this bar here the second bar social security 2006 to 2080 twice as long more than twice as long the social security deficit is 2 trillion it is clear that there would be plenty of money to deal with the social security trust fund if the president were not using the social security trust fund as a slush fund to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america instead of doing that we have a moral and legal obligation to pay back to the trust fund the money the president has taken out we cannot let the president do this by running enormous deficits the republicans want to force the government to break its promises to the elderly how on earth are they going to pay the social security trust fund back if they have gone broke on the other side by running up these deficits in the general fund democrats will keep americas promises to our seniors democrats have done it before and we will do it again when bill clinton was president we had 3 years of surpluses and with the surpluses imagine think of it zero deficits 427 billion in deficit for this year over 100 billion in deficit for the month of february alone this year and when president clinton was president the 3 years at the end of his term we had zero deficits and with the surpluses that were produced he was able to pay nearly 400 billion off of our indebtedness strengthening the solvency of social security likewise the democratic alternative that wag offered today included payasyougo rules that would block new tax or spending legislation that is not paid for not only is the republican budget fiscally reckless and dishonest it is morally irresponsible the leaders of five protestant denominations the episcopal church usa the evangelical lutheran church in america the presbyterian church usa the united church of christ and the united methodist church recently called president bushs budget unjust they reminded us of the words of the prophet micah who said what does the lord require of you but to do justice to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god does this budget do justice for americans you be the judge is it doing justice to our children to give tax cuts to march 17 2005 people making more than 500 000 a year while underfunding head start no child left behind student loans and grants and other education initiatives by 2 5 billion is that doing justice to our children is it doing justice to our communities to give tax cuts to the wealthy while funding for community police and local fire fighters who are vital to our homeland security by cutting them by 280 million is that justice is it doing justice to those who serve in uniform to give those tax cuts while underfunding health care benefits for veterans by 14 billion short of what is needed over the next 5 years is that justice for our veterans and is it doing justice to give tax cuts to the wealthy while launching a shameful attack on the poor this budget cuts 20 billiofi from medicaid a cut that governors on a bipartisan basis oppose and which the other body today has just rejected let us hear it for the other body it undermines the community development block grant initiative with all considered restructuring and a massive 35 percent cut it makes huge cuts to the earned income tax which takes 2 million children lifts 2 million children out of poverty

it is called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or even billions of dollars that you did not work to earn then this congress wants to serve you but if you get up every day and go to work to earn a living then dont expect any help from this congress the message all of this sends could not be clearer the republicans value wealth not work if you hold up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this congress to treat americas working families with the respect and dignity they have earned the choice to provide hundreds
