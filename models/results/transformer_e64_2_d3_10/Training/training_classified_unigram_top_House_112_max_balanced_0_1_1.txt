budget is all about i will say that i am getting unconfused because his budget is a destruction of the fabric and the way of life of all americans do you want to know what the republican budget does it cuts food assistance for struggling families it takes away affordable health care coverage for working families and of course it dismantles the health care safety net but also it deals with the education of our children as the cochair and founder of the congressional childrens caucus let me show you what happens when we dont educate our children we can see the numbers of individuals who are unemployed who have not had a high school degree our friends and the republican budget are going to cut education and theyre going to wind up with increasing unemployment because you can see that less of our americans are being able to go to college and therefore without college without a high school education we just undermine a growing childs opportunity let me tell you what else we do we go from children to their grandparents i remember standing on the floor of this house trying to prevent the doughnut hole from coming about but republicans again established a doughnut hole that millions of seniors have fallen through in fact the republican budget causes seniors to pay some 12 000 on their medicare listen to me clearly seniors you will be paying an extra 12 000 with the republican budget plan and of course we will open up the doughnut hole again the very doughnut hole that has been taken care of by the affordable care act on the other hand the democratic budget balances the budget and of course it recognizes the value of a shared sacrifice i just visited texas soldiers national guard they understand about shared sacrifice they support each other but this is a suicidal budget it has no shared sacrifice and all of the cuts come from the most vulnerable the republican plan is all about turning back the clock and throwing the poor people over the bridge that is what its all about it is a disgrace vote for the democratic budget mr chair i rise in opposition to the republican budget for fiscal year 2012 and beyond unlike the proposed democratic budget the republican budget purports to reduce our nations deficit by making disturbingly deep cuts to important programs and will have an adverse affect on our nations families children and the health of women the republican budget guts food assistance for struggling families the budget resolution calls for 127 billion in cuts to snap formerly called food stamps in a sixyear period 2015 through 2021 this proposal to blockgrant and reduce funding represents a cut of 25 percent in food benefits for some of the most vulnerable americans states will be forced to cut benefits to some households or create waiting lists for needy families takes away affordable health coverage for millions of working families the majoritys budget resolution calls for 1 4 trillion in savings from repealing coverage provisions of the affordable care act which congress enacted a year ago to hold insurance companies accountable and extend health coverage to more than 30 million americans who would otherwise be uninsured this would mean repealing 777 billion in tax credits to help low and middleincome families afford health insurance coverage dismantles health care safety net for vulnerable populations the majoritys budget devastates health security for 28 million poor children 5 million seniors and 10 million disabled individuals who rely on medicaid for a basic safety net of health care to protect tax cuts for the wealthy the budget includes the absurd idea to dismantle the medicaid program and to let the chips fall where they may no matter who might get hurt the real hard choices are left to others state governors who will decide which populations or health services to drop health care providers whose medicaid payments might get cut so low they will have to decide whether they can afford to continue providing services to medicaid beneficiaries lowincome families who may have to decide between buying groceries and taking a sick child to a doctor and adults with aging parents who may have to decide between sending a child to college or paying for their parents longterm care the democratic budget democratic budget reduces the deficit responsibly reaches primary balance by 2018 the democratic budget reduces the deficit by 1 2 trillion more than the presidents budget over ten years includes pell grant and supplemental nutrition assistance snap initiatives the democratic budget includes two mandatory initiatives that are fully paid for with spending reductions first it includes the presidents proposed mandatory funding to sustain the maximum pell grant award at 5 550 in contrast to the republican budget which cuts pell grant funding substantially the democratic budget protects medicaid and the medicare guarantee for seniors the democratic budget protects medicares guarantee of health care coverage for seniors and disabled workers it also preserves the existing structure of medicaid that provides a health care safety net for vulnerable children families seniors and persons with disabilities in contrast the republican budget dismantles medicaid and ends medicare by converting it into an inadequate voucher for the purchase of private insurance i would urge all members of congress to oppose the republican budget and instead support the democratic budget to responsibly cut spending and give americas families women and children a chance"], [0.0014525055885314941,

alternative to the republican budget that is mr van hollens budget proposal that is a statement of our national values that says to the american people what is important to you about the education health and wellbeing of our children the economic security of their families and the health security of our seniors those are important values to us and those values are reflected in the democratic alternative the republican ryan bill on the other hand i do not believe is a statement of our national values as to what is important to the american people as reflected in their budget priorities but you be the judge would it be a statement of your values if you had a budget that said to seniors were going to end the medicare guarantee and youre going to pay 6 000 or more while you get less in terms of benefits while at the same time were going to give an over 300 billion tax break to the wealthiest people in our country would that be a statement of your values this 6 000 more for seniors with fewer benefits 300 000 or more to the richest people in our country would it be a statement of your values for you my colleagues and the american people you represent if you had a budget that said to big oil were going to continue to subsidize you to the tune of tens of billions of dollars but at the same time were going to freeze pell grants were going to eliminate them for 400 000 young people and make them less available to over 9 million young people lower the benefits for some eliminate it for others and use the money to give tax subsidies to big oil big oil which is making tens of billions of dollars in record profits each year would it be a statement of your values if you said in your budget that all of those young people who are now children who have a preexisting medical conditionasthma diabetes birth defectany of those preexisting medical conditions under present law under the affordable care act they may not be discriminated against in obtaining health insurance but the republican budget says they should be because were going to eliminate that to the 2 5 million young people who are now on their parents policies until theyre 26 years old this budget says no to you too were eliminating that were too busy giving tax breaks to the richest people in america and while were at it with young people just graduating from college some of them may have student loans and in the house budgetthank you mr van hollenin the house budget we have a provision that says that come july 1 the interest on those loans will not double we have taken care of that under the circumstances the path were on the interest rates would go from 3 4 percent to 6 8 percent the house democratic budget says no to that doubling of interest the republican budget keeps it the same thats just to name a few things that i think may not be a statement of the values of the american people whether its interest paid on student loans availability of pell grants to young people ending the medicare guarantee and as the distinguished ranking member said right now today overturning the resources that were put in the affordable care act to reduce to narrow the doughnut hole maybe 5 million seniors have benefited to the tune of 3 2 billion already in the bill also there are preventative services there are annual wellness visits without a copay so were talking about kitchen table items for people where people are trying to make ends meet where people wonder about if their children will be able to go to college and if they do will they be able to have health insurance so that when they look for a job they can reach their aspirations without having their choices only narrowed by whether they have health insurance or not until the bill comes into full effect so there are just a couple of things that i would want people to know about this bill they are ends the medicare guarantee ends the medicare guarantee ends the medicare guarantee while making seniors pay more for less while giving over 300 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country and by the way did i mention it its a job loser so i urge my colleagues to enthusiastically support the house democratic proposal which is a statement of our values and which our distinguished colleague will presenti dont know if its tonight or tomorrow morning i understand that it keeps changing the house democratic alternative invests in americas priorities creates jobs protects our seniors and our students strengthens the middle class democrats protect medicare republicans dismantle medicare the democratic plan asks the wealthiest to pay their fair share and put our fiscal house in order the republican plan gives them more than the tax break theyve had they almost double their tax break our democratic plan reflects the most enduring theme in america the american dream democrats want to reignite the american dream to build ladders of opportunity for all who want to work hard play by the rules and take responsibility it does this by investing in small businesses and entrepreneurialism in our country by strengthening the middle class in that regard we believe that our budget is a statement of our values we call upon our republican colleagues to work with us on a budget that reflects our values we must work together to protect and strengthen medicare we must put people back to work and build a broadly shaped prosperity for all americans we must make it in america to stop the erosion of our manufacturing base we must rebuild america putting people back to work we must do this with community involvement and all of these things strengthen the middle class which is exactly what our democratic alternative achieves for the sake of our seniors for our families for our children for our workers i urge my colleagues to vote no on the republican plan which ends the medicare guarantee and makes seniors pay 6 000 or more for fewer benefits while it gives 300 000 in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the united states and it costs us jobs to do so and doesnt reduce the deficit until nearly 2040 its not a good deal for the american people the democratic budget is

republicans move a slashandburn budget that would turn medicare into a private voucher system and force seniors to spend more than 6 000 out of pocket every additional year it would gut medicaid education programs medical research and transportation among other things you name it they devastate it first the republican budget calls for a staggering 10 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations over 10 years it would pay for it by closing unspecified tax loopholes but this is a fraud for loophole closing of this magnitude the republicans would have to get rid of all the tax breaks the middle class depends on loopholes like the mortgage interest deduction the tax exclusion for employersponsored health insurance and charitable donations this wont happen which is why the republicans wont name any of their loophole closings the republican budget then proposes 5 3 trillion in nondefense discretionary spending cuts beyond what was agreed to in last years debt ceiling 1 2 trillion beyond it would slash 860 billion from medicare and all to pay for tax cuts because it wouldnt balance the budget until 2040 because these cuts are to pay for the tax cuts for the wealthy for shame mr chair i rise in strong opposition to the republican budget for fy13 as offered by mr ryan last year the republicans moved a slashandburn budget proposal that would have eliminated medicare and substituted for it a private voucher system and would have implemented devastating cuts to medicaid education programs medical research and transportation among other things you name it they wanted to devastate it now we turn to this years republican budget proposal and as one famous new yorker would say its d6ja vu all over again first the republican budget calls for a staggering 10 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations over ten years they claim to pay for this giveaway by closing unspecified tax loopholes but this is a fraud for loophole closing of this magnitude the republicans would have to get rid of all the tax breaks the middle class depends on loopholes like the mortgage interest deduction tax exclusions for employersponsored health insurance and charitable donations this wont happenwhich is why the republicans wont name any of their loopholeclosings so this would make the budget deficit 10 trillion largerwhich is why they do not anticipate balancing the budget until 2040 but they make devastating spending cutsnot to balance the budget but to pay for their tax cuts for the wealthy what priorities the republican budget seeks even deeper spending cuts than last years proposal it proposes 5 3 trillion in nondefense discretionary spending cuts 1 2 trillion 22 percent beyond the cuts agreed to in last years debt ceiling deal more than 60 percent of these cuts would come on the backs of middle and lowincome families for example the republican budget would slash 860 billion 34 percent from the medicaid program while turning it into an unguaranteed block grant these severe cuts would shift the cost burden to the states who would have to decide between investing even more of their own money cutting benefits shifting the cost onto beneficiaries doctors and hospitals throwing people out of the program or all of these the urban institute estimated that the republican plan would result in between 14 and 27 million people being dropped from medicaid by 2021 additionally the ryan budget would reduce food stamps by 134 billion knocking 8 to 10 million people from the program and leaving them to go hungry wic which provides nutritional assistance to women and children would also be cut taking food out of the mouths of 700 000 pregnant women new moms and their kids over the next decade nearly two million women and children would be left without access to critical food what kind of cruel and heartless country do the republicans want us to live in seniors on medicare dont fare much better first republicans would raise the eligibility age to 67 leaving seniors aged 65 and 66 out in the cold they would force seniors to go it alone in negotiating with private insurance companies for coverage seniors would receive vouchers to offset the cost of private insurancevouchers whose value would increase much more slowly than the cost of buying medical insurance cbo estimates that within ten years seniors would have to pay 6 000 more out of pocket for medical care annually all this mind you while promising to do away with all of the provisions in the affordable care act like medical ratio requirements which actually help to stem the cost of private insurance dont look to the republican plan for investments in infrastructure medical research or educationprimary or collegiate for students or for teachersbecause they are not there and the republican budget would greatly increase unemployment according to the economic policy institute republican spending cuts would result in the loss of 1 3 million jobs next year and an additional 2 8 million jobs the year after that thats 4 1 million jobs lost in just two years thereby eviscerating all the jobs added to the economy in the last 23 months and then some mr chair the sheer gravity of the cuts proposed by the republican budget is staggering and disastrous while no budget is perfect any of the democratic proposals under consideration today

that we the cbc are fighting for them every day and i thank you i rise to address the devastating impacts that the republican budget would have on the middle class and american workers as well as students seniors and the poor a budget is a reflection of priorities it exemplifies objectives and goals the republicans priorities are clear cut taxes for the most wealthy americans while achieving deficit reduction through drastic spending cuts to medicare medicaid snap and other important programs the republican budget would abandon the economic recovery we are in and implement policies that ship american jobs overseas it would assume deep cuts in transportation spending next year ignore job creation and reject sensible proposals for economic growth and future competitiveness the congressional black caucus will present a budget this weekthank you to my colleague mr scottthat would protect seniors who rely on medicare the disabled who need medicaid and the unemployed who would go hungry without snap it would support our economy through investment in transportation and infrastructure and would encourage american innovation the republican budget would reject investments in innovation by cutting funding for research and development it would ignore the benefits of these investments on future generations should the republican budget go into effect we would miss a great opportunity to support american innovation and to develop emerging technologies that create the jobs of the future in addition the republican budget would fail our students by proposing drastic cuts that would devastate education funding and increase costs for college students it would allow higher interest rates on student loans starting this year and eliminate the incomebased repayment plans that help graduates manage their loans in contrast to the republican budget the cbc budget would increase the maximum pell grant by nearly 1 000 and invest an additional 25 billion above the presidents budget in education and job training in fiscal year 2013 alleviating state and local education budget cuts and protecting jobs for teachers even the middle class is not spared from the republican cuts the republican budget would outsource jobs through tax policies it would actually encourage multinational companies to ship thousands of jobs overseas while costing the american economy billions of dollars by contrast the cbc budget would ensure that wall street bankers pay the same tax rates as working americans by taxing carried interest dividends and capital gains as ordinary income the cbc budget would close corporate tax loopholes adding approximately 1 3 trillion in revenue over 10 years just like last year the republican budget would end the medicare guarantee and shift costs to seniors rather than having the guaranteed coverage of benefits seniors would receive a voucher yet the voucher will not grow as quickly as health care costssimply shift costs on to seniors as the aarp pointed out the premium support method described in the republican proposal would likely price out traditional medicare as a viable option thus rendering the choice of traditional medicare as a false promise the cbc budget would support our seniors working americans and the middle class and the cbc budget will reduce the deficit by an additional 3 4 trillion as compared to the presidents budget over the next decade the republican budget would repeat last years attempts to drastically reduce snap formerly known as food stamps for struggling families it would slash snap funding by roughly 130 billion over 10 years and completely eliminate categorical eligibility snap is currently serving 47 million people nearly threequarters of whom are families with children throwing people off the rolls would make it practically impossible for people to afford a nutritionally sound diet for 2 years in a row weve seen republican priorities in the republican vision for the nation the republican budget is the wrong plan for american workers it is the wrong plan for families trying to put food on the table it is the wrong plan for unemployed americans the wrong plan for

extraordinary contribution that ranking member chris van hollen has made to this debate he has led our democratic members on the budget committee in a way that reflects the values of our country how we can meet the needs of our children their health their education and the economic security of their families when people ask me what are the three most important issues facing the congress i always say the same thing our children our children our children and the issues that are addressed in the budget address the needs of our children directly and the families in which they live i watched with great pride the debate and the strong distinction that has been made between a valuesbased budget put forth by the democrats that supports a thriving middle class and the ryan republican tea party budget that upholds millionaires over the middle class we are here today because the republicans in the house have decided over and over again to walk away from a bipartisan bicameral agreement that we reached to avert economic crisis and to reduce our deficit and to honor the full faith and credit of the united states of america they are walking away and punishing the middle class because they refuse to close even one special interest tax loophole to reduce our deficit they are putting big oil and millionaires ahead of americas middleincome families in recent weeks house republicans have voted twicenot once but twice here we go again in the words of a great republican presidenthave voted twice to pass a budget that gives massive tax breaks to the wealthiest americans while ending the medicare guarantee and increasing cost for seniors in the meantime that is an absolute fact today republicans are voting to begin implementing their outoftouch budget and middle class people seniors women and children will pay the price consider these few things i know that members of the committee have made the case but i just want to focus on a few things that affect people very directly in their lives this republicanryantea party budget will assault womens health by eliminating the prevention fund 326 000 women would not get the breast cancer screening theyre slated to receive next year 248 000 women would not get the cervical cancer screening theyre slated to receive next year those are big numbers but every individual case is important to the families that those women live in so the numbers are staggering but the specific cases are what is important and this is hundreds of thousands this budget would harm children and seniors literally taking food out of the mouths of babies as nearly 300 000 children would lose free or reducedcost school meals300 000 kids wait a minute were going to give a 400 000 tax cut to people making over 1 million a year and were going to take food from 300 000 children to do that 1 7 million seniors would lose meals on wheelspeople are familiar with that in their neighborhoods in their communitiesand other services it would put wall street ahead of middle class and working families by weakening the consumer financial protection bureau in the wall street reform bill we not only had the biggest changes in regulations so that the recklessness on wall street would no longer cause joblessness on main streetthe recklessness of some i dont paint everyone with the same brush the recklessness of some on wall street would not create again massive joblessness on main street in that same legislationand they were the biggest regulation changes in a long time decadesthe biggest change in history was in the consumer financial protection bureau this budget weakens consumer protection thats just not right so here we are again with the republican budget to name a few in contrast to this draconian republican bill democrats are fighting for a balanced approach that creates jobs expands opportunity reduces the deficit protects the health and economic security of americas families and honors the entrepreneurial spirit of

creating jobs bringing in revenue to reduce the deficit to make the priority choices that reflect the values of our country the values of fairness and opportunity of sustaining a thriving middle class

resolution is as follows h res whereas although our nations economy is gradually improving after one of the worst economic crises in our nations history the economic crisis remains a daily reality for the 13 3 million unemployed workers and for the millions of americans experiencing record levels of food insecurity poverty and foreclosure whereas the national unemployment rate is 8 6 percent with over 42 8 percent of all unemployed workers more than 5 7 million people having been out of work for more than 6 months whereas while there were 1 8 unemployed americans for every job opening in december 2007 when the great recession began data recently released by the department of labor show that as of october 2011 there were over 4 3 unemployed americans for every job opening whereas data recently released by the department of labor show that as of october 2011 there were 3 3 million job openings which is well below the 4 8 million job openings in march 2007 when job openings were at their highest point during the most recent business cycle whereas recent data demonstrate that most unemployed americans no longer receive unemployment insurance benefits reflecting the crisis that exists for the millions of americans who have exhausted their benefits and still cannot find work including the 100 000 illinoisans estimated to have exhausted their benefits in 2010 and the additional 100 000 illinoisans who it is estimated would exhaust their benefits in 2012 if current law were extended whereas unemployment benefits are a critical lifeline for our citizens and our economy including by keeping 3 2 million americans including nearly 1 million children from falling into poverty in 2010 alone generating 2 in economic stimulus for every 1 the federal government spent during this recession and saving or creating 1 1 million jobs as of the fourth quarter of 2009 alone whereas all members of the house of representatives have a responsibility to protect americans and our country from physical and economic harm especially during times of national crisis whereas the recentlyintroduced republican proposal to address the unemployment crisis facing our nation fails to protect americans by drastically cutting 40 weeks of unemployment assistance and imposing new restrictions that would make it more difficult and costly for employees to receive the benefits for which they have paid whereas the republican proposal fails to protect americans by cutting the number of federallyfunded weeks of unemployment benefits from 73 to 33 in high unemployment states abandoning over 1 million americans in 2012 by slashing their benefits whereas the republican proposal would likely result in the following states with elevated unemployment rates losing 40 weeks of unemployment benefits in 2012 alabama california connecticut the district of columbia florida georgia illinois idaho indiana kentucky michigan mis souri nevada new jersey north carolina ohio oregon rhode island south carolina tennessee texas and washington whereas the republican proposal would cause all other states to lose between 14 and 34 weeks of federal unemployment benefits whereas the republican proposal would erode the unemployment safety net by undermining the requirement that unemployment dollars fund unemployment benefits to help individual workers cover basic necessities such as food and housing whereas the republican proposal would further erode the unemployment safety net by undermining the eligibility standard that unemployment benefits be determined solely on the basis of a claimants unemployment whereas the republican proposal demands untested punitive measures that hurt unemployed workers including deducting money from ones unemployment check to pay for required reemployment assessments and delayed or prohibited benefits depending on educational attainment whereas the republican proposal would disproportionately harm groups of americans who are hardest hit by unemployment and longterm unemployment including older americans lowincome americans americans from racial and ethnic minority groups and americans without a high school diploma whereas now that emergency assistance is about to expire the republican proposal reflects comfort with 180 billion in tax breaks for the wealthiest 3 percent of americans for 2012 but not the 50 billion needed to help millions of the neediest americans who still cannot find a job whereas the economic policy institute estimates that the republican proposal would result in as much as 22 billion in lost economic growth and the center for american progress estimates that the republican proposal would lead to a loss of approximately 275 000 jobs in 2012 whereas it will tarnish the dignity and integrity of the house proceedings if the house considers a bill that cuts critical emergency assistance to millions of americans hinders economic recovery and disproportionately harms older americans americans from racial and ethnic minority groups lowincome americans and americans without a high school degree whereas it will tarnish the dignity and integrity of the house proceedings if the republican leadership holds hostage the 2 5 million americans who the department of labor estimates will lose their benefits by march 2012 if congress fails to act in order to push a radical agenda the american people have already rejected and whereas failure to allow consideration of amendments to protect vulnerable americans during consideration of a bill that substantially and permanently changes federal unemployment benefits tarnishes the integrity of the legislative process now therefore be it resolved that the house of representatives 1 recognizes the immediate need to extend current emergency unemployment benefits to promote our nations economic recovery by stimulating purchases creating jobs and preventing the loss of jobs 2 recognizes the immediate need to extend current emergency unemployment benefits to help the approximately 6 million unemployed americans who will lose benefits if current emergency unemployment benefits are not extended through 2012 3 disapproves of drastically limiting federal unemployment benefits until economic growth is robust and the nation is in a period of full employment and 4 calls on the leadership of the house to bring to a vote a clean extension of all current emergency unemployment benefits for a full year to protect the millions of americans who will lose benefits if the current statute sunsets at the end of december 2011 or if h r 3630 as posted by the committee on rules on december 9 2011 is enacted"], [0.0017200708389282227, 0.9982799291610718, 1, "mr chair i rise today to strongly oppose the republicans budget

will have to use this voucher to buy insurance from private insurance companies under the republican plan medicare as we know it will end and in the same budget proposal the republicans give away tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to big oil companies and under their plan they will slash support for seniors in nursing homes while giving away tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and what else americas seniors more than 150 000 in my home state of rhode island will literally be paying more for their health care and getting less in order to provide additional tax breaks to the wealthiest americans also reflected in this republican budget to make matters worse the republican plan does not reduce the deficit the nonpartisan congressional budget office determined that this budget actually adds 8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade because its cuts in spending are far outpaced by the gigantic tax cuts for the richest americans our seniors cannot afford this republican budget it would deny them health care longterm care and the benefits theyve earned and deserve the republicans choice to privatize medicare turning more power over to the insurance companies will result in reduced coverage and exposure to greater financial risks for our seniors the congressional budget office determined that under the republican budget seniors outofpocket expenses for health care would more than double and could almost triple to put that into context the congressional budget office found out that by 2030 seniors would pay 68 percent of premiums and outofpocket costs under the republican plan compared to only 25 percent under current law and it found that the republican plan means seniors will pay more for their prescription drugs because it reestablishes the doughnut hole even alice rivlin the former office of management and budget director under president clinton who worked with the republican architect of this budget on a deficit reduction proposal said she could not support his medicare proposal because it eliminated the traditional medicare choice and lowered the rate of growth beyond whats defensible and the conservative wall street journal concluded earlier this week quote the plan would essentially end medicare which now pays for 48 million elderly and disabled americans as a program that directly pays those bills under the guise of deficit reduction republicans are recklessly attacking the vital supports for our seniors we all agree that we have to address the deficit the issue is not whether we reduce the deficit but how we do it we cant cut what helps us create jobs innovate for the future and remain competitive in the global marketplace and we cannot balance this budget on the backs of our nations seniors the federal budget is about more than dollars and cents its a statement of our values and priorities as a nation republicans in this budget have set the wrong priorities they would rather cut benefits to seniors than cut subsidies to big oil or corporations that ship our jobs overseas the republican budget breaks the promise we made to our seniors to protect them in their golden years i

yielding me this time and i want to thank her for organizing this special order in honor of black history month but i want to take a few minutes to talk about the future last december when faced with the prospect that tax rates for the richest 2 percent of americans would rise to where they were in the 1990s when we balanced the budget and enjoyed unprecedented prosperity republicans decided that extending these unnecessary and unaffordable tax cuts was their number one priority as we all remember they held muchneeded relief to the middle class hostage and they got their tax cut for millionaires and billionaires according to the joint committee on taxation this tax is adding 39 billion to the deficit this year and will add even more next year speaker boehner has said that our national debt is a moral issue and i agree with him we need to act to curb our exploding deficits and mounting debt but republicans and democrats have different approaches to the problem the republicans approach is the irresponsible continuing resolution that was passed by this house 10 days ago republicans would cut 600 million from the cops program and 256 million from the state and local law enforcement assistance program which would make our streets less safe republicans would cut 75 million from the legal services corporation which would deny legal services to the victims of domestic violence republicans would cut 53 million from the food safety and inspection service which would threaten public health republicans would completely eliminate family planning funding which would result in more unplanned pregnancies and more abortions adding insult to injury republicans would cut 758 million from women infants and children which would deny these mothers and children the nutrition they need to begin life on the right track republicans would cut pell grants by 15 percent which would deny young people the opportunity to get a college education i could go on but i think you get my point the cuts in the republican continuing resolution are shortsighted counterproductive and the wrong way to cut the deficit and the one community or the communities that will suffer the most are minority communities in this country and that includes the black communities black students black mothers and black infants as well mark zandi the former economic adviser to the mccain campaign said that these cuts will destroy 700 000 jobs and stall our economic recovery which would lessen future revenues and further exacerbate the debt problem and a goldman sachs economist warned that the republican plan could reduce our nations economic growth by 1 5 to 2 percent in the second and third quarters of this year maybe i should amend my previous statement the cuts in the republican cr are shortsighted counterproductive and may not even cut the deficit we need a smarter approach we need an approach of shared sacrifice not sacrifice by the most vulnerable we do need to cut the deficit but there are different ways to cut the deficit and i believe the republicans have chosen the wrong way democrats offer a better approach we can cut the deficit by at least 61 billion in such a manner that helps doesnt hurt struggling americans our economy and our shared future first as i mentioned before we need to get rid of once and for all the tax cuts for the richest 2 percent of americans it is too late to save the 39 billion that we wasted this year but we could save more than that next year next i think we need to get rid of special tax preferences for oil and gas companies many of which were instituted by republicans the last time they were in the majority this would save 44 billion over the next 10 years there is no good reason to keep these subsidies in place the oil companies have said themselves that they dont need them john hofmeister the former ceo of shell oil said on february 11 in the face of sustained high oil prices it was not an issuefor large companiesof needing the subsidies to entice us into looking for and producing more oil next defense secretary gates has called for 78 billion in defense cuts over the next 5 years saying that these funds can be cut without putting national security at risk we should listen to him i want to thank my friend from the virgin islands for allowing me to speak here this evening i do believe that if we focus on these continuing resolutions that we have been debating we can have a much better future than the history has been for african americans in this country"], [0.0017580986022949219,

this house and up for senate consideration pulls the rug out from underneath our seniors it ends medicare by making huge cuts in benefits and by putting insurance companies in charge of our seniors health care letting insurers decide what treatment and what tests our seniors will receive under the republican plan medicare will end it will not only impact our seniors it will impact the family members of our seniors who will now have those responsibilities it will reopen the doughnut hole making it more expensive for our seniors to get their prescriptions the prescriptions they need to keep

drafted by mr chris van hollen and then of course the progressive caucus budget came up the black caucus budget came up i think mr mulvaney came up with a budget proposal they put the presidentsa very very watered down and inaccurate version of the presidents budget up there and weve been talking budget when we talk about the budget what were talking about is the values and priorities of america its important to keep this in mind what shows up in your budget is what you care about what does not show up in your budget is what you dont care about now i always caution people not to just take their family budget and the united states budget and assume theyre basically the same thing one just is bigger than the other thats not exactly accurate there are important differences and we shouldnt mix up the two but in this way they are similar in that they reflect what it is that people value if you have a family and their budget you can look at their budget they spend a lot of money on entertainment you can pretty much figure they value that if they put a lot of money into food you can figure they definitely think that is a priority for them you can go through the family budget and see what people spend their money on see what people dont have in their budget and then you can pretty much figure well maybe thats not a priority for them of course they may not be able to afford it at this time but if you talk about reasonably middle class people their budget reflects what they care about what matters and what doesnt and for our nation that certainly is true if our nation puts more money into warfare than it does into social uplift jobs and the economy and infrastructure that says something about who we are if our national budget puts more money into infrastructure and jobs and putting people back to work then that says something about who we are the various budgets that have come up reflect what the various caucuses think is important and project a vision for our country i want to talk about that today i want to start by talking about paul ryans budget paul ryan is the republican budget committee chair hes a nice guy i dont have anything bad to say about him personally because he is actually a nice person but the fact is we disagree in a significant way about what the priorities of america should be for example the republican budget 20 children will lose access to head start to pay for one millionaires tax cut thats their budget just if you want to understand what their tax cuts represent it means 20 kids dont get to go to head start so that a millionaire can get a tax cut150 000 equals 20 times 7 500 so if you look at this tax cut a millionaires tax cut which will amount to about 150 000 these little guys dont get to go to head start now what is head start head start is a great program for lowincome kids to make sure that they have a chance at getting a quality education and dont fall behind in school and so this is a great program it has great results these head start kids 20 of them going to head start versus what a millionaires tax cut would be which is 150 000 now this is the choice were making we should not act like were not making choices we are making choices we are deciding my friends on the republican side of the aisle like to say oh we shouldnt pick winners and losers were always doing it they just pick the rich people and weipick the kids in head start also if you just want to get a sense of what the republican budget what it does and what the tax cuts that its calling for mean republican budget 150 college students will have their pell grants cut by 1 000 to pay for one millionaires tax cut so one millionaires tax cut 150 000 but 150 times 1 000 all these kids these college kids trying to make something of themselves their pell grant is going to get whacked by 1 000 bucks so again choices do we want to make sure the country club set is doing even better or do we want to make sure that these aspiring engineers these aspiring doctors and teachers these aspiring police officers these aspiring workers of tomorrow will have a shot at an affordable college education this is what were talking about these are the choices that were making and i think its very important that americans know it its critical that we know it now lets just not stop there lets talk about other critical choices being made because i think it is so critical that as were talking budget week and all the budget decisions that we are making that we make it real clear to the american people what it is were choosing republican budget 216 pregnant or postpartum women infants and children would lose access to wicthats the women infants and children program and it provides food for poor women and their kidsto pay for one millionaires tax cut so 150 000 tax cut for a millionaireagain this is the country club setequals about 216 pregnant women or postpartum women and the amount of money that americans give them so that they can have good nutrition for their kids these are poor women these are women who are struggling economically but just because theyre struggling economically we dont want their kids to go without good nutritious food so as americans we have the wic program well theyre going to get slashed out of the program because a millionaire needs a tax cut thats the choice that were making i want to talk about why were making that choice in a minute but i want to give one more example republican budget 25 seniors paying 6 000 or more for medicare to pay for one millionaires tax cut so if youre a millionaire and you get a tax cut under what the republicans want to give youyoure already doing good but they want you to even do betterthat will mean that youve got about 25 seniors who have to pay 6 000 a piece more for their medicare so mom dadif youre my age mom and dad are senior citizens if youre younger theyre not but if your parents or grandparents are on medicare and theyre doing all they can on their fixed income to make it theyre going to need a little extra help because weve got to make sure that that millionaire gets his 150 000 tax cut these are the choices that were making now my friends in the republican caucusgod bless themits not like they dont like poor people many of them are very charitable they give in their different walks of life maybe their faith community or whatever they just dont think government should do it this is what they say they think that government needs to get out of that and let churches mosques synagogues and other folks do it of course that would mean that it wouldnt get done because even though churches mosques and synagogues do great work they can never possibly come up to meet the need thats out there what theyre really believing isthis is what they really believe they believe in something called trickledown economics they believe that if you give this millionaire 150 000 more dollars than he already has he will maybe hopefully perhaps invest it in plant and equipment and maybe somebody will get a job because of it or maybe not or maybe he will invest in china hell improve jobs but just not in america nobody knows what they will do with this tax cut but this is what the republicans believe they think that if you give rich people more money they will invest in plant and equipment create more economic activity and it will trickle down to the rest of us the only problem is that it has never worked it doesnt stop them from saying it but its never worked in fact the gop budget will destroy more than 4 million american jobs in the next 2 years according to the economic policy institute the economic policy institute estimates that the shock to aggregate demand from nearterm spending cuts would result in roughly 1 3 million jobs lost in 2013 and 2 8 million jobs lost in 2014 or 4 1 million jobs through so a little bit more than 4 million jobs over the next 2 years now people might think well keith is that right well yeah its right and ill tell you why its right its right because when republicans say we need to cut government waste we need to cut government cut government cut government they act as if theres just some big government thing over there like its a big giant piece of styrofoam and they can just cut it and it doesnt change anything what theyre talking about cutting are federal workers theyre talking about laying off federal workers and theyre very derisive about government jobs and act like people who work for the government dont do anything of valueof course this is not true at all but if you look on this chart right here it says i earn less than 45 000 a year explain to me gop how cutting my pay creates jobs this particular person is named paul and he is an army depot worker i think we need army depot workers teresa is a nurseand this is her right here she lives in my district and she says twelve percent of the salary i earn caring for veterans goes to my retirement explain to me gop how cutting my retirement puts people to work well one of the things that they do in the ryan budget is cut into federal workers retirement they act like oh the government no the government is people the government is nurses the government is army depot workers and what about federal prisons that keep dangerous criminals behind bars i pay more than 9 000 a year for my familys health insurance explain to me gop how cutting my takehome pay lowers unemployment this guy is a corrections officer and thank goodness for correction officers or the streets that we live on wouldnt be so nice the bottom line is when republicans say oh were going to shrink the size of government what they mean is theyre going to lay off and cut the pay and cut the employment benefits of federal workers people who work in prisons at risk to themselves nurses who care for our veterans people who are army depot workers and people who work in our parks and people who fix our roads and a whole lot of other people heres a chart for you if you look at the ryan budget if you look at the gop proposal if you look at it and it could do what they want it to do it could cause a loss of up to 7 million jobs by 2016 because it would cut federal workers and then they wouldnt be able to have the money to spend in the neighborhoods they live in anymore that would then have a ripple effect in their neighborhoods because theyre buying less for example if that young nurse at the va in minnesota if she doesnt have the same pay as she had before then she cant buy as much as she bought before then the company she shops at doesnt sell her as much as they have before you do that enough multiply it times enough people and that company then needs to start laying off people so its a ripple effect what the republicans are asking for but if you look at what they wantedand im talking about going all the way back to h r 1 which is their proposalyou would see repealing health care reform that would cut about 2 million the gop budget that would cut about 3 million cuts to the federal workforce that would cut about 285 000 the socalled jobs act that would cut a lot the fair tax that would cut and they would just cut on down the line what theyre basically proposing is by shrinking government and by doing all that stuff theyre getting rid of people now i just want to be on the record because your words do get twisted if there is a federal program that is not justifiable and its so poorly run that its of no value to anyone im okay with cutting it i just want to say that on the record on the house floor im all right with cutting programs that dont work but when youre talking about va nurses and youre talking about corrections workers in federal prisons we need these people they do good stuff and i believe that we should stand by them as they stand by us the gop budgetnow going back to the budget we addressed todaywill shift costs to seniors for the medicare guarantee according to the aarp and whats aarp thats the leading organization representing retired persons and the cbowhats the cbo that is the congressional budget office and for folks who like to watch cspan id just say you need to know what cbo is because this is very important congressional budget office theyre the nonpartisan group that says whats really going on with the numbers at the same time it is raising the seniors cost this gop budget gives those making more than a million a year an average tax cut of about 394 000 so i put 150 up there a moment ago that was the generic millionaire the actual number is about 394 for the average millionaire per year on the average tax cut and also the tax breaks for big oil companies you know they get about 4 billion a year im talking about if you look at conoco exxonmobil and all the big oil companies they get about 4 billion a year now how much did you pay for gasoline im not saying that theyre not good people im not saying that they dont run a good business and supply an important product im just asking you this does exxonmobil really need your money through a tax subsidy do they i think that they dont need your money i think their 4 a gallon is taking care of them just fine and i think its outrageous that the republican budget that we dealt with does not eliminate that tax break in short the big oil companies who are gouging americans at the pump and the wealthiest americans win while middle class and working class families get the short end of the stick last year oil profitsand this is an exact number or close to it last year big oil profits totaled about 137 billion but you dont need to remember 137 billion all you need to remember is big oil profits were the biggest ever that the oil industry ever had and yet were forking it over to them through our tax money not through the pumps some people might think well of course were paying them keith through the pump they give us gas weve got to get to work so we need to buy the gas im not talking about that im saying they getthey can apply for grants and subsidies and it all adds up to about 4 billion a year with soaring gasoline prices big oils 2012 profits will even be bigger yet republicans want to give big oil more money in our tax dollars and it just doesnt make any sense now of course you shouldnt expect the big oil companies like exxonmobil to say we dont want the money of course they want the money who doesnt want money everybody does including them but the people who have a public responsibility to look out for the american people should be willing to say no to public subsidies for the exxonmobils of this world and again if you work for exxonmobil im not running you down im just saying that youre doing well enough and you dont need the help of the american people you can do fine on your own now those kids on head start need help they need help those college kids need help but not exxonmobil executives the major consequence for medicare and medicaid the ryan budget the republican budget has big consequences for medicaid and medicare many seniors will be forced to pay sharply higher premiums to stay in traditional medicare and keep their current choice of doctors new medicare beneficiaries would pay more than 1 200 more by 2030 and more than 6 000 by 2050 before more seniors would gradually shift to private health insurance plans over time increasing privatization of medicare more than 47 million americans would lose health care insurance over 10 years because they would get rid of obamacare now my friends in the republican aisle when they say obamacare they dont mean it in a nice way its an insult but you know what obama does care so i dont mind them saying obamacare i hope they keep saying it because theyre just reminding americans that obama cares about them and that the people the republicans want to look out for apparently do not states under the republican plan would be forced to slash medicaid eligibility benefits and payments to health care providers their budget shreds the medicaid safety net and shifts health care costs to states and beneficiaries blocking medicaid this shifts all risks including future recessions health care cost increases and disasters to states and beneficiaries so heres the thing this ryan budget this republican ryan budget it helps and takes care of the rich it ignores everyone else and it hurts the middle class the republican budget would weaken the middle class in important ways first and foremost their plan ends the medicare guarantee of decent health insurance in retirement it also slashes critical middle class investments such as education and infrastructure by 45 percent and 24 percent respectivelyeducation by 45 percent infrastructure by 24 percent now look the american society of civil engineers has told us that we have crumbling infrastructure in this country to the tune of about 2 2 to 3 trillion a lot of money and if you are living in any city across this country you can drive over 75yearold bridges you can drive over potholes our sewage systems need upgrade i am from minneapolis minnesota a city i love so much but back a few years ago we had a bridge fall into the mississippi river because the gusset plates which are those plates that hold up the bridge gave way because the adequate maintenance just wasnt maintained over time now it happened to us but it could happen anywhere there are many structurally deficient bridges across this nation literally thousands we could put people back to work if we put the money into taking care of them and not only would we have people working wed have to save bridges to go over but the republican majority to use their phrase kicks the can down the road and doesnt deal with this looming infrastructure crisis so let me just say this ive talked a little bit about the socalled ryan republican budget i dont want to spend all my time talking about it but i do think its important for americans to know that this is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for people whove got it well who are doing fine now let me just tell you i swear i am a big fan of welltodo people i wish i were one of them but my point is that you dont need to help people who already have a lot of help on their own but you do need to help schoolkids head start kids pregnant moms pregnant lowincome moms seniors these people we should help people who are doing fine they dont need our help they should do the helping in my opinion and yet the ryan budget says were just going to help the country club set and i think thats not any way to have a budget im going to talk about the progressive caucus budget but i just want you to know first that the ryan republican budget is no good budget for america in fact its premised on the theory that rich people dont have enough money and poor people have too much really thats the animating organizing feature of their budget that if we gave rich people more money then they might invest it in plant and equipment and then itll trickle down to the rest of us and poor people have too much stuff we cant afford it we cant afford head start cant afford wic cant afford home heating oil for seniors cant afford medicare cant afford medicaid the poor folks are just theyre getting treated too well and thats basically what the theory is of the republican budget and so thats fine and i respect them for being real honest about what they believe in because a budget is a reflection of our values so now that weve talked about what theyre talking about lets talk about a real budget not for the 1 percent but a budget for all the progressive caucus budget has a name the name of the progressive caucus budget is the budget for all thats the name of the progressive caucus budget because unlike the republicans budget which is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for all let me tell you what it does it creates 3 3 million jobs in the first 2 years it cuts the deficit by nearly 7 trillion 6 8 trillion no benefit cuts to medicare medicaid and social security the budget for all makes the american dream a reality again for the vast majority of americans by putting americans back to work the budget for all enhances our economic competitiveness by rebuilding the middle class and investing in innovation and education our budget protects medicare and medicaid social security invests in americas future and asks those who have benefited the most from our economy to pay their fair share now as i said you cant have a budgetyou can have a budget that cuts taxes for rich people if you then cut services for poor people and you can have a budget that pays for infrastructure and education but the money has to come from somewhere and we ask people who already have lots of it to do a little more for their fellow americans were not hiding that fact yes we would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans not to punish them because we dont think taxes are punishment but because its necessary to meet the needs of the nation and any selfrespecting patriot would do so if they could in fact there is a group out thereand i would urge you to check them out mr speakercalled patriotic millionaires who understand that they may need to pay higher taxes if you already are making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that lowincome pregnant women got some food for their kids if you are already making a million or more a year would you pay a little extra to make sure that little kids had head start to go to if youre already making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that the federal workers dont have their pensions cut to pay for your tax cut thats just my thinking i dont want anybody to think the republicans are mean they do charitable work in their individual lives and thats a fact and i think people ought to know that but they dont think government has any role in helping people i disagree with that and call on americans to look carefully at the choices that they offer the budget for all is not a budget for the 1 percent its not a budget for the 99 percent but a budget for all because we care about the 1 percent too we want even the 1 percent to live in a good nation with fairness with economic opportunity with economic mobility with good roads good bridges good education clean water clean air we want this for everyone the budget for all attacks americas persistently high unemployment levels with more than 2 4 trillion over 10 years in jobcreating investment this plan utilizes every tool at the governments disposal to get our economy moving again including directhire programs that create school improvement corps park improvement corps student jobs corps and others targeted tax incentives that spur clean energy manufacturing cuttingedge technological investment in the private sector widespread domestic investment including an infrastructure bank a 556 billion surface transportation unlike this thing that they tried to pass today which is a 3month extension by the way can you believe it the republican caucus is always going on and on about uncertainty what did they do they created uncertainty by passing some 3month transportation bill my goodness it boggles the mind actually back to the budget for all there is approximately 1 7 trillion in widespread domestic investment unlike the republican budget the budget for all substantially reduces the deficit and does so in a way that does not devastate what americans value we achieve these notable benchmarks by focusing on the true drivers of our deficit unsustainable tax policy wars overseas and the policies that helped cause the recent recession rather than putting the middle class and the social safety net on the chopping block the budget creates a fairer america it ends tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans on schedule at the years end extends tax relief for middle class households and the vast majority of americans creates new tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires in line with the buffett rule principle eliminates tax code preferential treatment for capital gains and dividends abolishes corporate welfare for oil gas and coal companies eliminates loopholes that allow businesses to dodge their true tax liability creates a publicly funded federal election system that gets corporate money out of politics for good it responsibly and expeditiously ends our military presence in afghanistan leaving america more secure at home and abroad it also adapts our military to address 21st century threats through modernization the department of defense will spend less and stop contributing to the deficit but they will have what they need to keep america strong which is very important to all of us it provides a makingworkpay tax credit for families struggling with high gas and food costs extends an earned income tax credit and child dependent care credit invests in programs to stave off further foreclosure invests in childrens education by increasing education training and social services the budget for all is a budget for all i know that sounds repetitive but its important to note that the name of our budget reflects the reality of our budget and the reality of our budget is that we want to see rich poor and everybody in the middle do well in america that means a budget for all as i begin to wind down i just want to say that it is an honor to come before you to talk about the budget for all but its also an honor to talk about the ryan republican budget because the ryan republican budget offers a very different vision of america than the budget for all the ryan vision says that if we just could get rich people more money they might create some plants and equipment that will hire the rest of us the budget for all says no were in this together and were going to ask the wealthiest to pay more to invest in health education transportation and infrastructure so that we can have a stronger better greater america two visions of a nation one says austerity for the middle and working class and the poor and one says investment one says if you are out of luck youre on your own and one says as americans were all in this together i want to thank you for allowing me

but they will under the affordable care act if this amendment were to pass if it were to become law immediately all of those children who can now be on their parents policy if their parents are willing would lose their health insurance with a job or without a job these young people coming out of school are idealistic and ambitious they want to follow their passions and their pursuits that is what our founders told them they could dolife liberty and pursuit of happiness these young people want a healthier life to pursue their happiness to choose a job not based on the health benefits it may or may not provide but to choose an occupation which addresses their aspirationsnot ours theirs so i just want to repeat back to our colleagues something i heard them say over and over again they said we didnt read the bill well we did but clearly you did not and i urge you to read the bill because if you did you would see that the bill puts medical decisions in the hands of patients and doctors not your favorite insurance company you would see that it brings down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors you would see that it ends the days of discrimination based on preexisting conditions and lifetime caps on the care of children and families you would see that under this bill no longer would being a woman be a preexisting medical condition as it is now as women are discriminated against in terms of price and access to insurance you would see that it offers tax credits to millions of small businesses who choose to do right by their employees and offer insurance benefits it was for all of these americans that we acted it is for them that we stand here today to oppose this amendment and if you read the bill you will see contrarycontrary to misrepresentations that were set forth by those who do the bidding of the health insurance industry in our country you would see what the bill does you would see that it is about innovation its about prevention its about a healthier america not just health care in america its about using the technologies of the future its about bringing health care closer to people where they live to lower the cost to improve the quality and to expand the access you would see that it is a bill about the future instead of the misrepresentations about this that and the other thing which i dont even want to repeat here you would see that this is transformative for our country because it gives people the liberty again to pursue their lives so i would like to know how many of you read the bill we read it over and over again to each other drilling down on different parts of it so we know of what we speak when we come to this floor and maybe if you knew more about it you wouldnt be so quick to saywe do not want to allow children to stay on their parents policies we do not want to end discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions for our children we do not want to begin to close the doughnut hole we do not want to have preventive medicines without cost and copay for our seniors and the list goes on and on so thats whats happening here today this is again yet again another example of our friends standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the american people standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the health and wellbeing of our country it is again an example of washington d c holding on to the special interest status quo it is again this congress saying to the american people we are here for the special interest we are not here for the peoples interest to stacie we are not here for your two daughters for vernal we are not here for women and having being a woman being a preexisting condition to claudette and richard to say to them too bad about your mortgage if you cant pay your mortgage because you have to pay your medical bills so be it i urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment which is another manifestation of the so be it attitude

this continued use and abuse of the american soldiers they endure much and its time for us to bring them home we thank them for their service we see them as they return some of my colleagues and i are working on a major effort to try to deal with more than 365 000 of those men and women that have returned that are suffering from posttraumatic stress syndrome dealing with everything from suicides to depression and other issues as they return home and many of them still in the military dealing with those issues we also have the traumatic brain issues and so theres much to be done and there will be much more to be done for those that are currently suffering and the longer this war in afghanistan continues the more men and women will be suffering from all sorts of medical physical and mental issues so walter thank you so very much for what youre doing here on the floor day in and day out and reminding us that its time for us to end this war what i want to spend some time on today is really talking about americas middle class the middle class in america has suffered for the last 25 years the american middle classs circumstances have stagnated and in the last 5 yearsactually 6 yearshave seriously declined weve seen this in the statistics weve seen them in the economic statistics the only way the american middle class has been able to sustain its economic position has been for both husband and wife or children to join in providing the income for the family its no longer a singleperson income sustaining the american middle class it is about our policies here on the floor of congress and the senate that has led to the decline of the american middle class specific policies have been enacted over the last two decades that have hollowed out the opportunities that the american middle class has counted on specifically manufacturing in america once 20 million americans and their families were in the manufacturing sector they enjoyed a good salary a good hourly wage was available to them such that one individual in that family working in the manufacturing sector was able to support the family own a home take a vacation buy a boat provide for the college education that is not the case today only 11 million and a few thousand beyond that are actually engaged in manufacturing in america today so what happened to the 9 million they lost their jobs those jobs disappeared not from the earth but disappeared from america they went overseas they were outsourced american jobs were outsourced why well theyd like to say its simply the nature of the free market system and indeed thats part of it but thats not all of it a major part of it had to do with specific tax policies and other manufacturing industrial policies that were enacted by congress and remained on the books for some 20 years or more we need to address that issue because if in fact it is the policies of this congress and previous congresses that have led to the great outsourcing and decline of the american manufacturing sector and along with it the american middle class then theres something that we can do about it we make laws we establish policies and if we find that there are policies that are contrary to the good ability of the american economy to prosper and the middle class to prosper along with it then we ought to change those policies thats what the make it in america agenda is all about the make it in america agenda is specifically designed to rebuild the american manufacturing sector this is an issue thats been taken up by the democratic caucus led by our minority whip mr hoyer and carried on by my colleagues and i so were going to talk a little bit about that i notice that my colleague from new york has joined us mr tonko we were going to start out on health care but we kind of morphed into the issue of the american manufacturing industry and the role of the middle class now the middle class i went off on manufacturing and the need to rebuild that and the make it in america agenda but also a key part of the inability of the american middle class to sustain itself is health care and the affordable health care act which the supreme court recently confirmed was constitutional is constitutional is a major effort on the part of the democratic congress and president obama to provide not only health care but to lift up the american middle class so lets hold for a moment the issue of make it in america well come back to it in the latter half of this hour but lets take up the health care agenda which i know you wanted to speak to initially while youre doing that im going to run and get a couple of placards that show what it is were talking about please mr tonko from the great state of new york part of the eastwest team"], [0.9915295839309692,

to see my good friend from massachusetts is in opposition but it shows that there are differences in the fisheries i guarantee you that the fishermen in my state would say this is not to circumvent the law this is a law that is now working in our state and highly successful this amendment would block the use of catch shares from managing our nations fisheries by superseding the regional fishery management council process set up by congress i live in the heart of a district where people have lost a tremendous amount of fish and are looking for ways to make sure that they have a fisheries industry to pass along to their children and grandchildren the sectors management system in maine has done that it has allowed innovative fishermen like members of the maine coast fishermens association to manage their small business in a way that works best for them in their own way of managing it by having an allocation and the flexibility to fish on their own schedulewhich i can tell you is far safer and far more profitablefishermen can enter into contracts with processors and avoid the race to fish improving their bottom line and their safety and its been proven over and over again some maine fishermen have even developed communitysupported fisheries coops which bring local fish to the tables of local consumers strengthening our communities while getting fishermen a better price for their catch it is critical for coastal communities and working waterfronts that fishermen are allowed to utilize the best management tools for their particular fishery catch shares may not be the best option for every fishery but that decision should be left to the industry the management experts and the scientists in their region where the fishery occurs in order to help our fishermen we should be focused on improving the stock assessments implementing cooperative research programs addressing monitoring challenges and ensuring fair enforcement this amendment would do none of these things instead it would take a critical management tool out of the toolbox to keep our fishermen on the water i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting fishermen by keeping all options available for wise fisheries management by opposing this amendment and sticking with the fishermen in the state of maine who have found this highly successfulfar more safe for the industry and much more

commerce committee and as weve heard from the bills supporters the bill is intended to address the boiler mact rule that was proposed by epa in april of 2010 and finalized in february of 2011 many of us here know that when the boiler mact regulation was finalized epa asked for 15 months to issue a reproposal the courts rejected that request and thus epa was forced to issue the rule on time in february of 2011 however epa immediately instituted an administrative stay on several major rules within the regulation saying that they would begin reconsideration with new information that had been made available in the last few months ive met with many industries and companies that expressed concern with the provisions in this final rule ive listened and even helped foster ongoing conversations between those industries and epa as they worked toward a reproposal of the boiler mact rule then we were offered this bill the epa regulatory relief act we were told that this bill would simply give epa the time that they had already asked for to work on the rule and repropose a new final rule after the conversations i had had with companies in my district i thought this would be a good solution the problem is when you dig a little deeper ive said for a long time this epa boiler mact rule is far from perfect but the trouble is the bill we have before us today is even further from perfect because it doesnt just give epa time to reconsider the rule it tells epa they cant issue a new rule for at least 15 months but theres no deadline for final action further it practically rewrites sections 112 and 129 of the clean air act by eliminating the need for numeric emission limits for mact standards but perhaps the most egregious to me was section 3 of the bill it once again rewrites the clean air act the clean air act provides for 3 years for compliance with mact standards with the possibility of a 4th section 3 of this bill tells us to throw that out it tells us that for the boiler mact rule compliance cannot be required for at least 5 years however it then says to the epa administrator it gives the administrator the ability to establish compliance dates so depending on who the administrator is at the time these rules are finalized compliance could be required in 5 years in 10 years in 50 years in 105 years thats just unacceptable and thats why im offering this amendment today i support many of the things in this bill and i recognize the need for a reproposal of this rule but i dont support 5 years to infinity for compliance and so this amendment will simply require that we go back to the established compliance time lines in the clean air act it even gives the possibility for an additional year of compliance if a compelling reason is found i urge my

having such a big national debt recognizing those two facts i want to speak up about them first of all if this were just talking about how we can reduce the deficit the best way to do that is job creation we know that if we want to talk about what happened in the nineties we have to reference the fact that under president bill clinton the reaganbush deficit that he inherited he turned around and five of his last budgets the clinton budgets were in balance or were in surplus he put us on a trajectory he and the growth of jobs in our country in the public and largely in the private sector took us to a path a trajectory of 5 6 trillion in surplus along comes president george w bush and in record time he reversed that it was the biggest fiscal turnaround in our nations history taking us to a trajectory of over 5 trillion in deficit an 11 trillion turnaround two unpaidfor wars said the cbo the nonpartisan congressional budget office that was because of two unpaidfor wars the bush tax cuts particularly at the high end which did not create jobs and a giveaway pharmaceutical bill to the pharmaceutical industry those were the three main reasons for the big fiscal turnaround and how we got deeply in debt i dont remember a lot of complaints coming from the republican side of the aisle while president bush was taking us down this path mr goodlatte referenced two paths well this is one path that president bush took us down so now we have to deal with that because the deficit is a concern to all of us we believe that the best way to deal with that is what president clinton did which was to have a great economic agenda to generate jobs yet here we are nearly 320 days into the republican majority and they have taken no action on any serious jobcreating bills here we go again debating legislation that will not create jobs in fact according to experts the enactment of this proposed amendment to our constitution would destroy 15 million jobs double the unemployment rate and cause the economy to shrink by 17 percent as bruce bartlett said recently former economic adviser to president ronald reagan and to president george herbert walker bush even if we were not in an economic crisis and fighting two wars a rapid cut in spending of that magnitude would unquestionably throw the economy into recession just as it did in 1937 this legislation is an attack on our economy and it is an attack on our seniors according to the nonpartisan center on budget and policy priorities it could result in cuts over 10 years of 750 billion to medicare and 1 2 trillion in cuts to social security these cuts would be devastating to the 40 million seniors who rely on medicare and social security every day they are even more draconian than the cuts in the republican budget which would effectively repeal the medicare guarantee and just one week after our nation celebrated veterans day we are debating potentially cutting 85 billion over the next 10 years from veterans benefits my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim this is a clean balanced budget amendment it is not because this proposed amendment to our constitution will require a supermajority in both chambers of congress to raise the debt limit it puts the full faith and credit of the united states of america in the hands of a minoritythis after we went through all of the stress and strain and uncertainty and downgrading of our credit rating when we couldnt even get a majority and now were thinking of a supermajority vote for the debt limit increase again that was never a requirement when president bush was president that there would be a supermajority to raise the debt limit this amendment promotes further brinkmanship and uncertainty enshrining extreme ideology into the constitution at a time when americans have been very clear that they expect us to set differences aside and to get to work it is our duty as members of congressindeed we take the oath of officeto be the elected guardians of our constitution to protect and defend it and to do no harm to our founding documents yet if this proposed amendment is adopted it will have farreaching and adverse consequences i repeat that it was a democratic president president clinton who balanced the budget in the nineties five of his budgets were in balance or in surplus we can do it again without harming our constitution our economy our seniors or our veterans we must start by creating jobs and strengthening our economic growtha key to reducing the deficit it was interesting to me to hear others on the other side of the

that this is about our constitution we owe it to the vision of our founders to the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and to the aspirations of our children to get our economic and fiscal
