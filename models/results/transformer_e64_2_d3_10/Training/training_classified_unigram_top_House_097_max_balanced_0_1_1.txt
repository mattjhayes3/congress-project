and to remind my colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure and may someday this

house small business oversight subcommittee which i cha r on todays business failure epidemic and the devastating toll it is taking on small business the subcommittee invited leading experts from the academic business and bankruptcy worlds to testify to find out why so many businesses are failing and what it means for our economy the hearings were held against the backdrop of the gravest crisis faced by american business since the great depression this is what we see capital investment by companies is off sharply data resources inc forecasts that business investment will be off 8 percent this year over last year despite the massive tax incentives to invest enacted last year aftertax profits of corporations in the first quarter of 1982 were almost onethird lower than a year earlier the sharpest drop in the postwar period the new york times reported earlier this week that corporate profits have reached the lowest levels in perhaps 5 years many companies are saddled with heavy shortterm debt the ratio of shortterm debt to total debt is at a new high business balance sheets and corporate liquidity are more fragile than at any other time in postwar history since the first quarter of 1981 industrial output has dropped more than 7 percent our nations factories ran at a dismal 69 8 percent of capacity in june of this year 15 percentage points below the rate at which capital goods makers start getting orders for equipment to add capacity small business proprietorship income is expected to be nearly 15 percent lower this year than in 1980 according to data resources inc and businesses are failing at a rate not seen since the great depression todays figures as reported by dun bradstreet the business information concern are truly alarming the failure rate today is almost 90 per 10 000 listed companies just short of the failure rate of 100 per 10 000 companies recorded in the great depression year of 1933 put another way 11 businesses are failing right now for every hour of the business day business failures have only become a serious problem since 1981 looking back over the postwar period we find that business failures ranged between 1946 and 1980 from a low of 5 per 10 000 listed companies in 1946 to a high of 64 per 10 000 in 1961 the business failure rate average for those 35 years was 40 3 per 10 000 listed companies beginning in 1981 however business failures began to shoot up in 1980 l11742 companies or 42 per 10 000 companies failed in 1981 the figures jumped to 16 800 or 62 per 10 000 companies for 1982 the prediction is 25 000 or 88 per 10 000 listed companies the average for 1981 and the first half of 1982 is 75 per 10 000 companies an 86 percent increase over the 194680 average in the past 2 years the business failure rate has jumped 110 percent the second largest 2year jump since 1920 the only time it was higher was in the 2 years immediately after world war ii when business failures returned from the depressed war level to normal todays figures are indeed grim we should remember that the dun bradstreet figures cover only failures which involve losses to creditcs the number of business failures today is really much higher since thousands of businessmen simply decide to close their businesses because they see only an unprofitable future these business closings which are really failures reflect a lack of confidence in the business environment and are not reflected in dun bradstreets statistics as president reagans recently released report on the state of small business tells us the dun bradstreet figures are a valuable indicator of business distress the hearings looked at this distress not only in numerical terms but in human terms what we are seeing today is a great human tragedy we must not forget that business failures mean lost jobs ruined lives and dashed dreams they mean lost pensions lost life savings and lost tax revenues they also take a human toll in the lost selfesteem felt by those directly affected they mean an end to the american dream of opportunity and owning ones own business that has been such a powerful art of this nations dynamism last march when it was becoming clear that 1982 would see a record number of business failures i wrote to 2 dozen unitedstates bankruptcy judges and trustees to find out why this was happening i wanted to hear directly from them because they are seeing every day what is happening why it is happening and what needs to be done to end this terrible spiral of failure i received 19 replies from throughout the nation which i included in the hearing record this is the picture that emerged from the letter business are failing in all sections of the country and in every economic sector large and small businesses and young and old businesses are failing business are failing in record numbers and the failure rate continues to rise the business failures experienced today are much worse than those experienced during the last severe recession of 19741975 business are failing today because of high interest rates and the deep recession the revised federal bankruptcy code is not a cause of the increased number of business bankruptcy filings let me read a few of the responses unitedstates bankruptcy judge peter m elliott of los angeles wrote i would say that the major cause of small business failures is high interest rates unitedstates trustee william p westphal sr of minneapolis wrote the two primary causes for the increase in bankruptcies generally as well as for small business in particular are the extremely high interest rates and the length of the current recession unitedstates trustee scott h bush of dallas wrote the tentacles of the current recession reach to all communities at all locations even the glorious sunbelt has not been insulated the current recession is much more severe than the 19741975 recession unitedstates bankruptcy judge charles b mccormick of chicago wrote the increase in small business bankruptcy filings must i feel be blamed on the common elements of high interest tight money inflation the loss of jobs due to plant closings and the farming out of work to foreign countries and the other ills that greet one in the media every day unitedstates bankruptcy judge william l norton jr of atlanta wrote i do not see incompetency or mismanagement or dishonest actions in individuals or businessmen which some credit grantors or others ascribe to debtors in the bankruptcy court as being the cause of prevalence in bankruptcies i see the overwhelming number of individual and business debtors in this court who sincerely and honestly want to pay their debts and have been and are attempting to pay such debts i see many businesses and persons in my court who i feel there but for the grace of god go i as the letters i received show high interest rates and the prolonged and deep recession are placing an extraordinarily heavy burden on all businesses and small budinesses in particular this is the same message we heard from our academic witness at the hearing according to edward i altman a professor of finance at new york university and a leading expert on predicting business failures the devastating effects of reduced profits and high interest rates that have remained around 20 percent or more for several years are continuing to reduce the ranks of our smaller firm population because of high interest rates pro fessor altman continued businesses today pay more than 40 cents of each dollar of cash flow for interest charges up from 20 cents of 4 years ago no wonder so many marginal firms are succumbing to the economic reality of bankruptcy he said this is unfair small business relies almost exclusively on banks for financing they cannot shop around or bargain for the best interest rates as can large corporations many small businesses are paying at least prime rate or above prime for their loans that means close to 20 percent interest what makes these rates even more crushing is that the real interest rate is at least 10 percent the highest in recent memory the impact can be seen everywhere joseph w duncan the chief statistician for dun bradstreet presented to the subcommittee his firms latest business failure figures they showed continuing and sharp increases throughout the nation and in all industries the sun belt and mountain states are as hard hit as the farm states midwest and midatlantic region the failures touch not only the weak manufacturing wholesale retail and construction sectors but also the previously strong service industries what does the future hold only more grim numbers and more tragedy the subcommittee was tdid unless the economy improves and interest rates decline significantly i am afraid that the already staggering number of business failures will swell to levels comparable to the early 1930s the normally cautious professor altman predicted in 1932 the nadir of the great depression 31 822 businesses failed for a catastrophic failure rate of 154 per 10 000 listed companies the risk he added is that increased business failures will lead banks to tighten credit further and thus accelerate the business failure spiral if banks ration credit to only the most creditworthy firms professor altman said the marginal firm will stand little chance of surviving it is also probably true that the marginal firm is oftentimes also a small firm todays problem goes beyond high interest rates the problem stems from the mix of economic and fiscal policies currently being followed that have driven our nations economy into the worse recession since world war ii and created the severest liquidity crisis for business since the great depression as professor altman warned the real risk is not whether the economy will turn around and stage a recovery but how long the recovery will last if the turnaround is relatively short like the one we experienced in late 1980 then thousands of firms particularly smaller ones will not have sufficient time to get back on a positive cash flow basis the consequences are obvious and ominous we will see a ripple effect throughout the economy as failing large companies topple small firms doing business with them thousands of people will lose their jobs this is happening right now unitedstates trustee james eichstaedt of los angeles told the subcommittee that the bankruptcy last april of the wickes cos the large retail chain has cost several thousands jobs and seriously squeezed the small firms that did business with wickes with so many large unitedstates companies in such desperate financial straits we can count on it happening again and again and again if new economic and fiscal policies are not adopted that will bring interest rates down to affordable and stable levels and encourage the economy to grow e"], [0.006455540657043457, 0.9935444593429565, 1, "i am refer the purchase in the united states of two ring to the house

appreciate the kind words of my good friend mr annunzio and i would like to take this opportunity to thank him for all of his assistance in bringing this legislation to the floor there is no question that without his able advice and counsel we would not be here today and the george washington half would be but a dream we are all aware of george washington and of the many things that he did to shape our republic in its early days however we tend to view him more as a marble statue to be honored than for what he was a very human person who did his best in trying circumstances and created a republic that is still the hope for freedom of much of the world today it is my hope that the issuance of a commemorative coin for his 250th birthday will cause people to think about his life as that of a man who lived rather than just as a historical subject h r 3484 provides for the striking of a special silver dollar by the mint to honor this important anniversary the coins when issued next year will have a composition of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper identical to the silver coins struck in this country before 1965 they will be available for 2 years 1982 and 1983 and will be legal tender for half a dollar although they will be sold for more than that h r 3484 provides that a maximum of 10 million of these coins will be struck with the actual number issued being limited to those ordered during 1982 the number 10 million is admittedly arbitrary but was chosen as the number most likely to approximate the actual demand for the coin at its maximum demand for the eisenhower silver dollar ran at close to 7 million and while i believe that the washington half will attract more interest i believe that 10 million is a fair estimate in addition i felt that the mint should have some way to plan its production and that a ceiling would probably heighten the interest in the coin and encourage early orders my legislation provides that the price will cover all costs associated with the coin plus a profit of up to 20 percent the sales will be handled according to regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury and all profits will go into the treasury general fund briefly there are three reasons why h r 3484 should be approved first a commemorative half dollar is a fitting way to honor the 250th birthday of george washington second there is a market for the coin and it will provide an american alternative for the millions of collectors and investors who invest in silver coins yearly and are now limited to foreign coins as sqch it will help our balance of trade to some extent third the sales of these coins will provide a profit to the treasury that will help to reduce the deficit in fiscal year 1982 of these three reasons the first the desire to commemorate george washington on his 250th birthday is the most important in honor of this anniversary a silver coin is particularly appropriate as washington took a special interest in the establishment of our nations first mint and was responsible for our first silver coinage personally the establishment of a mint was one of washingtons main priorities when he became president in 1789 but circumstances delayed it for over 2 years in a speech to congress on september 25 1791 he again urged the establishment of a mint to remove the scarcity of small change a scarcity which is so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes the congress responded to this plea and not only established a mint but also provided for a national coinage system washington took a personal interest in the establishment of this coinage system and intervened when the senate bill provided for the pieture of the current president on the coins instead he successfully urged that a representation of liberty be placed on the coins the next year 1792 he used 100 of his personal silver plate for the minting of the first unitedstates coins silver 5cent pieces according to old mint documents he had not forgotten his concern about the need of the poor for coins and the coins were promptly released into circulation as shown by the heavy wear that most of them exhibit today the coin that you are considering today will not be the first time that congress has decided that a coin is an appropriate way to commemorate an anniversary of george washingtons birth fifty years ago for the 200th anniversary in 1932 a special commemorative quarter was issued supposedly for 1 year only however it proved to be so popular that it remains in circulation today the second reason for passing this legislation is that not only is there a market for the coin domestically but it will also be the first and only american entry in the worldwide silver commemorative coin market although silver coins have not been struck for circulation in recent years many nations sell them at a premium to collectors and investors and make a profit on them one excellent example is the royal canadian mint which this year will offer a commemorative silver dollar honoring the construction of a transcontinental railroad across canada this coin is part of a regular series that canada issues yearly for sale to collectors with a new design each year the coin will be offered to americans in two finishes for either 18 or 14 depending on which is chosen their efforts to attract large numbers of american buyers are shown by the many ads for the coins that have appeared in major american papers including the new york times and the wall street journal the canadians are not the only ones taking advantage of the market the april 29 issue of coin world a major hobby paper lists new silver issues aimed at collectors and investors from austria egypt gibraltar israel poland sudan switzerland and venezuela in addition it displays a prominent ad from the soviet bank for foreign trade offering that nations silver and gold medals for sale silver coins are issued internationally for a variety of reasons the silver institute states in its april newsletter that many nations issued coins for the international year of the child in 1980 and that up to 24 nations will issue them this year to commemorate the international year of the disabled person modern silver coins are sold in the millions each year many of them to american collectors and investors the profits from their sale then goes abroad to the issuing government and helps their balance of trade while at the same time hurting ours american competition would not drive the others out of the market but it would have a wide appeal with the millions of american collectors and investors in addition it would attract some foreign business and would give all the option of buying an american coin nor is the tradition of commemorative coins foreign to this country beginning in 1892 this country issued commemorative silver halfs on 48 separate occasions gold commemoratives on 6 occasions and silver dollars and quarters once each in addition there was a 40percent silver set of coins commemorating the bicentennial the profits that this coin will provide to the treasury are the third reason to support h r 3133 as written the bill directs the treasury to price the coin so that all costs associated with the production and sale of the coin are covered along with a profit to the government of up to 20 percent of the total the exact percentage was left to the treasury so that the coin could be priced at the nearest quarter dollar or so as i mentioned earlier the profits will go to the general fund of the treasury and will help to reduce the deficit for fiscal year 1982 i cannot closely estimate how large these profits will be but if silver stays at about 11 an ounce it could equal up to 15 million if the entire issue is sold while the details of the sale are left to the secretary i would hope that the coin will be promoted through the media and through other outlets such as the mint mailing list in addition if possible i would like to see volume discounts similar to those offered at one time on bicentennial sets given to financial institutions and others to encourage them to offer the coin to their customers at the original issue price if these steps or similar ones are taken i believe that the entire issue would be sold out in conclusion i believe that this coin will provide a fitting memorial to our first president while at the same time offering an american alternative to those who choose to buy silver coins this is no susan b anthony dollar but rather a profitable venture into a proven market utilizing the mints almost 200 years of expertise ameri can coins are traditionally known for their technical excellence and enjoy a wide popularity in the world now an american silver half dollar will meet the same acceptance this will be a popular coin and will be accepted by the american people as a collectors item that honors a great american h r 3434 has the support of the administration and was unanimously approved by the banking committee i would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill"], [0.006642401218414307, 0.9933575987815857, 1, "there continues to be much debate concerning the issue of striking commemorative coins for the 1984 summer olympics to be held in los angeles at the present time there are two very different proposals before the congress designed to raise money to help finance the 1984 olympics and to help train american athletes for those games my proposal h r 3879 calls for a single silver dollar to be sold directly to the public by the mint the other proposal embodied in h r 3958 and s 1230 calls for numerous coins to be sold through private marketers in deliberating over these proposals we must be sure to consider the views of the american public since no program can succeed without its support fr this reason i would like to share with you some of the many letters i have received from all over america mr anthony cholewinski of pittsburgh pa calls s 1230 an olympic coin fiasco he also makes these comments concerning its scope there is no way that i can or will support the money grab of a series of 25 coins as has been described in the numismatic press i think that two simple commemorative coins manufactured by the mint with all profits going to the olympics will in the end pick up the same or more money than this elaborate unnecessary plan i am sure that you understand the state of the economy and i think with the size of the proposed lazardfreres issue it will not sell rest assured i will not purchase these the following statement from mr warren mendez of holly mich points out a number of the problems associated with the plan set forth in h r 3958 and s 1230 i am writing concerning the reports out of washington that the lazard freres international banking house and occidental petroleum are strongly lobbying for a minimum of twenty five 25 olympic coins twenty five coins in ridiculous who could afford that many coinscertainly not the average person there is a big resistance to buying an individual coin most collectors want complete sets i could not afford and would not participate in purchasing more than about five coins five is more than enough i also object to any private group skimming the cream from the profits of coin sales why cant the treasury department produce the coins in these times of economic stress it appears that congress is still steeped in waste and mismanagement i recently read reports of imminent layoffs of mint personnel why couldnt these people be put to work on an olympic coin program you are about the only friend we collectors have in washington please indicate to your colleagues in congress that as americans first and collectors secondly wed like to see a little responsibility taken by them and discard this stupidly conceived plan of olympic coinage i cant believe what is going down in the snake pit of washington ill these views are echoed by mr ross blakely of phoenix aris who also emphasizes the prohibitive cost of owning a complete set of the coins proposed in h r 3958 and s 1230 as a serious collector of united states coinage i agree wholeheartedly with the position of the american numismatic association and alternatively with your position relative to the proposed commemorative coinage for the 1984 summer olympic gumes in los angeles california the number of coins authorized should be four or less and marketing should be by a governmental agency i the senate bill calling for twentyfive designs to be marketed by outside interests is in my opinion absolutely unthinkable as nearly as i can determine a fortynine coin set with the twentyfive different designs as contemplated in the senate bill would cost the public about 5 000 to purchase a complete set your thinking in this matter makes a lot more sense to me and appears it would make much more money for the united states government than the program out lined by s 1230 therefore when the bill gets to your committee i respectfully urge your strong opposition to it mr j p burkaske from river ridge la also worries about the cost of owning a complete set of olympic commemorative coins i am a collector of 20 odd years i do not like the 25 coin bill for the 1984 olympics it is too much for the average collector i think 2 to 5 coins would go much better with collectors that way they could afford to collect the full set please vote no on the 25 coin bill perhaps none will suffer more from the enactment of s 1230 than those individuals who live on a fixed budget mr robert powers of coral gables fla writes i thoroughly oppose s 1230 and am in favor of a more realistic approach to olympic coinage i believe us retired folks and especially young people will have a much better chance to make additions to our collections both groups being of limited income mr william devinney of litchfield ill expresses doubts about the propriety of allowing private marketing of the coins keep up your battles to bring the 25 olympic coin issue back to the treasury department and the people who needs 25 coins it is a ripoff sure and simple between some members of your group and lazardfreres corporation to fill their pockets with illgotten gains at our expense finally mr john gurksnis of greensburg pa discusses the past abuses associated with the private marketing of commemorative coinage i favor a more realistic approach to olympie coinage i support your position of fewer coins and government handling of the program i believe that hobbyists today stand solidly behind the concept of an olympic coinage program they are fearful that 25 different coins distributed by private interests over a 2 2 year period would result in the same type of abuses and concerns that arose 45 years ago history after all does often repeat itself many of the issues discussed in these letters are very similar to those i have raised about s 1230 and h r 3958 these people object to both the excessive number of coins proposed and the private marketing of them they have repeatedly stated that they would prefer that the unitedstates government handle the entire program their faith in the ability and integrity of the government is certainly encouraging i note that some americans are suspicious of the motive of the supporters of s 1230 and h r 3958 while i do not share their suspicions the secrecy surrounding the marketing arrangements feed those views as the general accounting office has pointed out secrecy impairs congress ability to make informed legislative decisions to many people the secrecy surrounding a program that could run into hundreds of millions of dollars implies wrongly or not that there is something improper to hide many citizens have expressed their concern over the olympic coin program proposed in h r 3958 and s 1230 all they would like is a realistic program that every american could afford perhaps we could all learn from the gooo commonsense and restraint they have shown through these letters frequently the simplest most straight forward plans yield the best results let us keep this in mind when we consider

funding for our nations health programs we should not be fooled by the rhetoric surrounding this budgetthe revisions do not alleviate the devastating impact of the cuts on our nations most vulnerable citizensthey just shift them to those less able to afford it this latta budget slashes programs for the poor this latta budget is a disaster this latta budget is no improvement over the latta proposal we rejected just 2 weeks ago latta continues to propose deep cuts in health of 4 9 billion in fiscal year 1983 and 20 7 billion over 3 years while they talk about restoring the medicare cuts they still propose to cut social securitys medicare program by 3 2 billion in fiscal year 1983 that may be considered a restoration for those who proposed the irresponsibly absurd level of cuts in the last latta bill but it is in fact a deep cuta cut that will require us to shift even more costs to the aged and disabled medicare beneficiaries how do they finance this socalled restoration one way is by drastic cuts in medicald shifting even more costs to the states on top of the federal cuts we enacted last year and cutting funding for children the aged poor and those in nursing homes finally they have done nothing to improve their earlier proposal for flrt funding for discretionary health programs for 3 full years the result will be a severe cut in real purchasing power for biomedical research and critical public health programs lets look at these proposals in more detail they propose a 3 2 billion cut in medicare and for that they are trying to take credit for how nicely they are treating medicare the fact that that is an improvement over their last proposal simply highlights how ridiculous their last proposal was 3 2 billion is a deep cutand our aged and disabled constituents will not be fooled by rhetoric about restorations when their annual deductible increases under this proposal they will not be fooled when their cost sharing for home health services increases under this proposal they will not be fooled when they pay more and more out of pocket for physician services to make up for lattas arbitrary cuts in physician payments so i urge my colleagues not to be fooled by this rhetoricfurther shifts of costs to the elderly are unwarranted medicare is already so restrictive that it pays just 45 percent of the health bill of the aged we should not endorse this proposal that shifts this administrations budget problem to the aged person needing medical care for medicaid the latta budget is even worse apparently the designers of latta made a rather cynical decision to give to the aged with one hand by restoring a limited portion of the medicare cut while taking away with the other hand from those aged who are the very poorest by slashing the medicaid program let us look at these medicaid cuts in detail just last year medicaid was cut severely and those cutsof nearly a billion dollars a yearwere extended for 3 full years states are now desperately trying to cope with this years cat they face a further cut of 4 percent that is already programed into fiscal year 1983 now latta proposes a new cut of 1 3 billiona cut even larger than the controversial proposal we enacted last year more than 1 billion of this cut is nothing more than a pure shift of costs to the statesi think we all know that the states cannot afford this shift on top f the cuts we enacted last year i have sent to each of you preliminary estimates of what these cuts cost each statebut let me provide some examples to give you a sense of the order of magnitude of this harsh proposal pennsylvania would lose 36 million under two of the latta provisions on top of the 43 million cut already programed into fiscal year 1983total reduction to pennsylvania 79 million illinois would lose 35 million under two of these latta provisions on top of the 32 million reduction they already face going into fiscal year 1983total reduction to illinois 67 million i would be glad to share copies of this state data so that you can see the impact of each of your states the implications are clearthis budget attempts to solve the federal budget problem brought on by this administration by abrogating responsibility for it and shifting it to the states we cannot accept that policy how would the administration achieve these shifts of costs to the states it is interesting to try to determine this every explanation of how the cuts will be achieved changes as soon as the specifics are criticized omb is now in the acttrying to confuse the picture of how the savings will be made they are banking on the fact that by shifting gears every few hours they will fool enough people here so that they can get votes for the latta budget before we in the congress understand what the cuts mean but i do not believe members will be fooled the billions of dollars they intend to cut have not changed and i think we all understand that the real way they intend to achieve these cuts are the ways shown in all the descriptions that accompanied the latta proposal when it was released what were those changes first they would shift 600 million to the states by reducing the current federal medicald matching rate for all socallerl optional services and optional eligibility groups by 3 percentage points this means that states will either have to increase the amount of money they put into medicaid or cut back on current coverage i want everyone to understand who these optional groups are and what these optional services are the op tional eligibility groups are not just the medically needy but include all elderly and disabled persons in nursing homes with income in excess of 25 a month they are considered mandatory eligibles only if they receive less than 25 per month from all sources these are the people latta defines as optional for purposes of cutting federal funds under medicald states would have their federal support slashed for the large majority of medicaid aged and disabled individuals in nursing homes what are the socalled optional services they include nonskilled nursing home care prescription drugs dental care eyeglasses and hearing aids this 3percentage point cut in matching will force states either to find additional funds of their own or to eliminate coverage for these services and people that is how latta proposes to solve the federal budget problem for our nations discretionary health programs latta proposes flat funding of 8 billion per year for 3 full years real purchasing power will decline and the result will be serious shortfalls in critical programs biomedical research at the national institutes of health will decline funding for important and costeffective programs like childhood immunizations maternal and child health services family planning and nursing programs will be at risk this budget is totally unacceptable for health the aged and disabled medicare beneficiary cannot afford to have this budget pass the states cannot afford to have this budget pass lowincome children aged individuals and nursing home patients cannot afford to have this budget pass our public health efforts cannot afford to have this budget pass i urge all of you

act originally introduced by me last week i the modification has to do with the income eligibility limitations under the program rather than basing the limit on the area family median income the revised version of the bill would utilize the statewide family median income a statistic which is already kept by the department of housing and urban development i believe the use of the statewide figure would be more equitable lnd would eliminate the possibility that families with identical incomes in neighboring communities in the same state would or would not qualify for the program based upon the statistical area in which they happened to reside this concept continues to recognize however that incomes around the country vary from state to state and takes that into account in determining the proper income limitations as in the prior bill eligibility would be for those at or below 130 percent of the family median income but as i have said the statewide not area median would be employed there are no other changes to the legislation high interest rates are making it virtually impossible for firsttime homebuyers even those with very reason able incomes who have saved diligently to afford a home besides the dev astation caused to these families by their inability to participate in the american dream of homeownership construction and building trades persons homebuilders realtors building suppliers and those in financial institutions have suffered greatly as millions of the postwar babyboom generation have reached adulthood the problem has only gotten worse and the administration unable or unwilling to propose concrete solutions has done nothing unacceptably high interest rates show no sign of significantly decreasing any time soon the firsttime homeowners opportunity act would provide mortgage assistance in fiscal year 1983 to more than 100 000 firsttime home purchasers whose family incomes are no more than 130 percent of statewide median this assistance would be utilized to reduce the cost of an phainsured mortgageby direct payments by the federal government to the mortgage holderto as low as 9v percent but would be limited to no more than the amount necessary to reduce monthly payments for the mortgage insurance and real estate taxes to 30 percent of the homeowners income the limitations requiring the homeowner to expend 30 percent of income on housing costs means that the mortgage will not necessarily be subsidized to as low as 9 percent thus saving federal expenditures and allowing us to serve a greater number of firsttime buyers payments would continue for 10 yearsunless the homeowner sold the homebut could be continued after 10 years if the secretary of hud determined that the family was still financially unable to assume the full cost of the mortgage assistance would be recaptured upon sale of the home but would be limited to 50 percent of the net appreciation of the value of the property purchasers of new and existing singlefamily homes and individual condominium and cooperative unitswhich do not result in the displacement of a tenantcould utilize the program the maximum sales price would be 110 percent of the maximum pha mortgage which will mean a price limit of 74 000 in most parts of the country the minimum downpayment would be 5 percent of the purchase price to illustrate the dramatic effect this program can have on the lives of firsttime homeowners take the following example to purchase a 60 000 hme a modestly priced dwelling by todays standards and to carry a 57 000 mortgage at 15v percentthe current fha interest rate limitfor 30 years cost 767 including mortgage insurance adding real estate taxes and hazard insurance means the monthly housing cost is likely to be over 900 a family earning 35 000 applying 30 percent of its income to housing could not afford such a mortgage without the assistance this program would provide on the other hand with the help the firsttime homeowners opportunity act would offer a family with an income of approximately 25 000 applying 30 percent of its income could afford the same mortgage and home and could therefore have a chance to participate in the american dream the 400 million appropriation authorized in this legislation would help alleviate the most serious and widespread crisis we have witnessed in the housing industry

several other pieces of literature all aimed at promoting a unique numismatic adventuregreek olympia coins these coins are being marketed by numinvest corp a subsidiary of the parisbased international bankers lazard freres an organization that wanted to market unitedstates olympie commemorative coins as you know the house of representatives recently approved my olympic coin proposal by a vote of 302 to 84 this plan calls for the minting of two silver dollars and one gold 10dollar coin to be sold directly to the public by the mint the house vote signaled an overwhelming rejection of a rival proposal that called for the minting of 17 coins to be sold to the public through private marketers i vehemently objected to the private marketing plan because it had all the ingredients of a firstclass ripoff too many coins issued with nontraditional face values a prohibitively high price tag and an enormous potential for private profiteering at the expense of our olympic athletes if numinvests greek venture is any indication of how they would have approached the marketing of our olympic commemorative coins my suspicions were wellfounded when i opened the greek olympia coins brochure i was immediately struck by the slick packaging there is absolutely no way to deny itthis is an impressive brochure the photographs are clear the layout bold and the text of the copy persuasive it is filled with reference to the history of the modern olympics and their greek heritage indeed the designs for the coins shown in this brochure were based on ancient works of art after perusing the leaflet a bit longer i decided to look more closely at the information on the coins themselves and this is where the story really gets interesting this pamphlet merely describes the first series of coinsthere are two more to come these coins can only be purchased in sets of either three silver or two gold coins so if you want to buy just one coin you are out of luck although the brochure contains quotes like these coins have already cpatured the interest and admiration of experts around the world due to their historical significance beauty attention to detail and affordable price in light of their generous precious metal content these coins are hardly what you would call a good value a set of silver coins in uncirculated condition costs 64 50 the same coins in proof condition are 93 based on current exchange rates and silver prices these coins have a total face value of 13 14 and contaih bullion worth 8 31 that is an incredible markup ranging from 390 percent to 608 percent over the intrinsic value of the coins the gold coins are priced in a similar fashion they are available only in proof condition with a set of two going for 527 70 these coins have a face value of 116 and contain bullion worth 176 at todays gold prices the consumer is paying three times the intrinsic value of the coins a complete set of three silver and two gold series i coins in proof condition has a price tag of 620 70 for this sum the consumer receives 184 worth of precious metal and coins with a face value of 129 one should keep in mind that these figures represent the cost of owning only one series of coins in proof condition the actual cost of participating in the program could be considerably higher since there are three threecoin series each of proof and uncirculated silver coins and three twocoin sets of proof gold coins indeed owning a complete set of the coins would cost 2 056 the 24 coins in the complete set would have a combined face value of only 427 and contain bullion worth 577 these figures certainly refute the brochures claim that this is truly an affordable collection contrary to the marketers claim that the greek olympia coin collection is sure to be sought after by collectors as the first authentic coin issue of its kind these coins are not likely to appreqlate in value the greek olympia coins are what experts call pseudocoins that means that the coins although they officially have legal tender status are really more like medallions since their face values and technical specifications are artificial and arbitrary as a result they are not attractive to coin collectors numismatists tell me that the coins are not likely to be worth any more than their bullion value thus the consumer is paying over 2 000 for bullion worth only 577 one piece of literature states thatthree percent of the face value realized from the sale of the coins in the united states and canada will go to their respective olympic teams and athletic federations therefore as a subscriber to this collection you become in a real sense a participant in one of mans oldest and noblest traditions if someone purchased these coins in order to support our amateur athletes he or she would be sorely disappointed spending either 64 50 or 93 for one series of the silver coins would yield the unitedstates olympic committee exactly 39 cents our amateur athletes would receive 3 47 from the 527 70 one spent on a set of gold coins if one paid 2 056 for the entire series of coins the net to our athletes would be 12 75 this is hardly a cost efficient means of supporting amateur athletics i soon realized that the slick packaging was a vain attempt at disguising the shortcomings of the product itself you may in fact be wondering exactly what it is that greek olympia coins are commemorating i wondered the same thing as i was leafing through the brochure the marketers go to extreme lengths discussing the greek olympic traditionundoubtedly in the hope that you will think that these are greek olympic coins they are not these coins are being struck to commemorate the 1982 paneuropean games to be held in athens nevertheless you would have an extremely difficult time figuring this out from the sales material one piece of literature mentioned the word olympic or its derivatives 23 times there was only one reference td the paneuropean games apparently this ploy can be very effective the person who sent me this material attached a note that began enclosed find letter i received on greek olympic coins as you can see this is a clear case of misleading advertising the coins are grossly overpriced worthless to collectors useless as a means of raising money for amateur athletes and have absolutely nothing to do with the olympics given the history of privately marketed commemorative coins i should not have been surprised by this latest commemorative coin scheme throughout the entire olympic coin controversy i warned this congress about the inadvisability of allowing the consortium formed by lazard freres and occidental petroleum to market our olympic coins the greek olympia program is a clear example of that the house vote signaled a clear mandate to keep these people out of our program however although the house has endorsed a governmentrun program the full congress and the administration have not yet concurred if they retreat from the house position and favor the private marketers we may very well end up with a greek olympiatype program if that happens these marketers will make huge profits at the expense of both the

the answer to this question the answerin one wordis reaganomics reaganomics has produced a 1983 projected deficit of 182 billion compared to a reaganomics deficit of 182 billion 116 billion looks good but only in comparison to the outrageous result imposed upon us by reaganomics last year the administration told us we needed a massive military buildup they said we needed to spend 1 5 trillion on the military over 5 years along with this massive increase in military spending they said we needed an enormous tax cut to be more specific they said that the wealthy and big corporations needed a big tax cut the message was the ntion needs this big military buildup but we do not have to pay for it in fact we need to make major cuts in our revenues this illogical combination of spending increases and tax cuts was somehow supposed to instill confidence in the financial markets this has not happened what has happened was what was predictable all along the financial markets saw that reaganomics produces increasing deficits and so they kept interest rates high and stifled recovery in addition to a 182 billion deficit reaganomics has also given us the worst recession since world war ii last

expects a lost of rhetoric for the benefit of special interest groups usually there is little action to benefit the nation or its economy but rather a lot of pandering that in the long run proves to be harmful to our future this was the case recently on a vote regarding a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of congress that funding appropriated for title v of the older americans act the senior community service employment project should be maintained in future years at the level necessary to insure that its current jobs and other services be maintained or expanded on the surface this resolution sounded magnanimous and full of compassion for our fine elderly citizens as could have been expected it passed by an overwhelming margin in the house i voted against it for several reasons first i do not dispute the intrinsic worth of a senior community service program i am well aware that our older citizens have much to offer their communities and nation and that too often they are shunted aside by the now generation my concern centers around which segment of government should finance such a program with a budget deficit of more than 100 billion this year it should be obvious that the federal government does not have the money i have absolutely no objection to programs of this nature and local and state governments and perhaps private enterprise might wish to consider maintaining and expanding this program state and local governments generally have to operate within balanced budgets lack the massive moneyabsorbing bureaucracy of the federal government and allow local people to have more control over their own programs second it is pure hypocrisy for congress to decry massive budget deficits and overspending by the federal government and to sponsor balanced budget amendmentswhile at the same time playing to the grandstand with proposals that add to the federal deficit third it is wildly inaccurate to claim that federal progrpms pay for themselves and do not end up costing the taxpayers if overspending by the federal government paid for itself as is claimed for virtually every domestic program contained within the budget we would not have 100 billion deficits or trillion dollar national debts today fourth such resolutions are in themselves meaningless because congress will either appropriate the funds or it will not therefore one must assume that the purpose of such proposals is simply another liberal ploy to encourage partisan and philosophical demagoguery prior to the november general elections liberalsand many conservatives are quite aware that they will be painted as ogres haters of the elderly and uncompassionate individuals if they vote against such grand sounding proposals fifth spending on the federal level for this and similar programs actually worsens the lot of those it is designed ostensibly to help federal overspending robs the elderly and forces their backs against the wall by creating inflation inflation destroys the purchasing power of the elderly more than any other group because so many are dependent on fixed incomes so while the seen hand of federal largesse may have the public relations image of helping the elderly the unseen hand of federal deficits debt and inflation soon destroys any positive effects that earlier help may have had sixth such resolutions actually make prostitutes of many politicians becaue they in effect sell their votes for the programs in return for the votes of specific groups on election day in other words the unspoken agreement is that the various lobbing groups will urge their member to vote for congressman x because he voted for the program pushed by that lobbying group the problem is that the money of current taxpayersand future taxpayers considering the national debtis being used to buy the votes finally this process and the lack of courage on the part of many politicians are the reasons why our nation is in such an awful economic mess today we must realize the federal government cannot give something to anyone or any group that it has not first taken away from someone else this is especially true where deficit spending is concerned because it obligates money from future taxpayers with our national defenses desperately in need of rapid rebuildingit has been postponed for more than a decade due to committments for social spendingand our economy in dire straits the amerian people deserve more than irresponsible rhetoric and demagoguery from congress unfortunately in the case of this vote they did not get it from the majority of house members

of equality with todays introduction of the equal rights amendment era the history of this struggle continues the necessity for this struggle is not something to be proud of since it was originally introduced in 1923 the era has fought a constant battle against those who wish to maintain their power yet time and time again polls overwhelmingly indicate that the vast majority of anmericans support this simple constitutional amendment at the first womens convention at seneca falls n y in 1848 it resolved that it is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves their sacred right to the elective franchise it took over 70 years to obtain that right but what is significant about that resolution is that it pro claimed it womens duty to secure their rights just as men must participate today they must have participated then but the impetus the leadership the drive must come from women women have learned these important skills in their participation of the abolitionist labor and civil rights movements it is no coincidence that after each of these movements obtained great strides women in turn called attention to their demands their rights this last decade of struggle has been particularly difficult and frustratingthe era goal so close and yet failing but one thing women did learn and unfortunately it was a hard lesson is that women must fight for their rights as simple as sensible as those rights may seem no one will give them away and once those rights are secured as undoubtedly they will be the fight to preserve those rights will have to be maintained recently women have begun to understand just how vulnerable they still are as nearly every program every advance has been attacked or weakened by the reagan administration the womens education equity act title ix family planning the equal rights amendment and countless other programs and regulations have been threatened am pleased to see that women are learning to be politically

brought us to attention today we should ^be saying you have led the way now well proceed many of us would like to claim bold leadership in addressing the issue of cutting government spending we cannot we are following the orders of our constituents who preceded us on this issue we now have the responsibility to carry out those orders congress own committee funding is a good place to start i support the 10percent reduction it is a significant cut yet it would not ii 1091 cripple any necessary committee action we know that some committees and subcommittees should be cut even more others should be cut less or not at all as wielders of the ax we must make discriminate chops statistics documenting the growth of government spending are so numerous as to strain our capacity for retention some point to the growth of congressional staff as a prime example of the ballooning bureaucracy well it is true congressional staff growth and the increase in committee funding levels over the past 10 years is well documented by figures the figures however only address the symptoms the disease itself remains we need to be wary of the quick cure and if we are to be responsive to the budgetcutting demands of our constituents we must look beyond the figures documenting congressional stnff growth to the reasons for this growth there is where the doctoring is really needed one reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the burgeoning bureaucracy in the executive branch executive branch personnel and funding levels have increased enormously over the past two decades new programs have been instituted with corresponding new staffs task forces have been established to study specific problems old programs have been expanded and staffs increased to handle the work load it is quite understandable that congressional committee staffs have increased commensurately just to monitor and conduct oversight investigations of increased executive branch activity we must also cut back the executive bureaucracy president reagan has promised to reduce the size of the federal work force to reduce the size and number of federal programs i believe that he is committed to this kind of a spending cut in the federal bureaucracy when this happens it should be easier for us to also reduce the sizes and budgets of our special committee staffs responsible for doing the work generated by some of these executive agencies another important reason for the growth of committee staffs can be traced to the legislative reorganization act of 1970 this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 320 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect this act partitioned the committee staffs into majority and minority parties and gave each an unwritten but implicit mandate to develop partisan positions let us look at the hard statistics on this point from 1960 to 1970 the funding levels for investigative committee staff increased by 328 percent this figure is certainly large enough in and of itself but from 1970 to 1980 investigative committee staff funding increased by 526 percent this is a sizable increase in the rate of committee staff growth and it happened immediately after the legislative reorganization act went into effect there will be an attempt here today by the minority to cut committee funding even more than the substantial 10percent cut proposed by the distinguished majority leader anything more than the 10percent cut would be a severe blow to the efficiency of the house committee system the purpose for such a cut is more than simply to spend less money we know that the senate now controlled by the minority has not seen fit to cut its own committee funding to this extent we know that the senate and the white house while being budget conscious in spending levels for their own staffs are still leaving themselves sufficient funds to carry out their mandated duties efficiently at the same time though there are those who would demand that the house sustain a burden of budget cutting greater than its share to the possible detriment of its efficiency and its ability to do its job i can only assume that this effort is a partisan one designed more to hamper the effectiveness of a house still with a democratic majority than to be responsive and responsible to the budgetcutting demands of the american public our president has told us that the issue of reducing federal spending at all levels is nonpartisan our constituents tell us the issue is nonpartisan commonsense tells us the issue is nonpartisan yet the structure of our committee system created by the reorganization act of 1970 makes it partisan as do some of the efforts on the floor of this house
