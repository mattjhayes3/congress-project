that we are not fooling anyone any more we know and they know that the soviets have received the grain that they need we know and they know that we are already exporting 8 million tons of grain this

colleague the gentleman for arizona who handled the rule on the minority side i want to express to them my appreciation for their remarks concerning all the members of this particular committee and the nonpartisan manner in which it has operated as in past years this bill authorizes all the funds for the next fiscal year as well as supplemental funds in the current fiscal year for the intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of the unitedstates government the category of intelligence activities includes all the activities of the central intelligence agency the defense intelligence agency the national security agency other intelligence components of the department of defense and the departments of the army navy and air force the bureau of intelligence and research of the department of state the intelligence divisions of the federal bureau of investigation intelligence elements of the departments of the treasury and energy and the drug enforcement administration and the intelligence community staff of the director of central intelligence these activitles provide intelligence for the use of the president the cabinet the national security council and the joint chiefs of staff further this bill authorizes intelligencerelated activities of the department of defense which are programs that are integral to the defense force structure but which are similar to national intelligence programs and are often tasked for national intelligence purposes particularly in peacetime the similarity of programs and functions between the national intelligence programs and the intelligencerelated activities of the defense department is the reason that both are considered by the permanent select committee on intelligence and authorized in this bill we have worked to assure that the program areas arecomplementary and mutually supportive but not duplicative the referral of this bill to the committee on armed services has assured that the judgments we have made from an intelligence viewpoint are equally sound from a military perspective we have worked closely with that committee on a continuous basis and achieved a position agreeable to both committees even before referral most intelligence activities are classified and necessarily so in some cases even the very existence of the program or activity is held secret this sensitivity limits the description we can offer here on the floor the schedule of authorizations to accompany the bill and the classifled annex to the report have been available to members a number of members have reviewed these materials the subject material is complex but we have continued to revise these classified reports to improve their clarity the committee continues to recommend that the budget for intelligence not be disclosed the disclosure of a single budget number might not itself be harmiul but some explanation of the content and meaning of the number would be essential but such an explanation would be excessively revealing moreover the committee recognizes that intelligence is inherently secret and any disclosure is the beginning of an erosive process in discussing this point people often refer to the degree of disclosure of our military budgets and systems it is not a good analogy the existence of military systems must be known in order to have deterrent value if deterrence fails military systems are effective in battle because of their numbers the manner in which they are employed and the skill of the personnel using them conversely in the case of intelligence the mere awareness of an intelligence activity can easily reduce or eliminate its effectiveness may endanger lives and may lead to the collection of false information contrived by our adversaries to confuse or mislead us i would like to summarize briefly the organization of i r title i provides for the bulk of our intelligence and intelligencerelated activities as i said earlier funds and program details are in the classified schedule of authorizations and the annex to the report one exception is the authorization for the counterterrorism program of the fbi which is unclassified the bill provides 12 1 million for this function title ii provides necessary authorities for the intelligence community staff whose function is to assist the director of central intelligence with his responsibilities for overall coordination of intelligence and preparation of the budget the staff is made up of representatives of all elements of the intelligence community administratively it is treated as if part of the cia title iii provides authorization of 91 3 million for the central intelligence agency retirement and disability system this is a program established by congress in 1964 to provide for those cia personnel who perform hazardous duties or are in special situations usually abroad which may limit the length of their careers when title iii is read for amendment i will offer a technical amendment that would conform ciards as it is called so as to afford certain ciards retirees the opportunity to exercise options which can be made by their counterparts under the civil service retirement and disability system although current law now permits the president by executive order to conform ciards to prospective changes made to the civil service system the differences in question existed prior to this change in the law hence the need for the amendments title iv authorizes additional intelligence and intelligencerelated expenditures in fiscal year 1982 the details of this supplemental authorivation are found in the classified annex to the committees report title v consists of a provision prohibiting the unauthorized use of the defense intelligence agencys name initials or seal in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such use was authorized and authorizing the attorney general to seek to enjoin such unauthorized use this section is identical to those enacted last year protecting against the unauthorized use of the cia and nsa names initials or seals title vi contains a provision providing to spouses and former spouses of certain cia employees entitlements and rights in relation to retirement and survivors annuities comparable to those provided to spouses of foreign service officers by the foreign service act of 1980 this provision recognizes the enormous equity that cia spouses have in their employee spouses careersboth in terms of the assistance they provide to intelligence operations and their sacrifice of their own professional advancement the committee was thoroughly persuaded that these spouses deserve the same benefits as do foreign service officers spouses nonetheless the bills provisions are more stringent than those of the foreign service act since they require that spouses to qualify must serve overseas with their employee spouses one reason for the bipartisan support which h r 6068 enjoys is that all of the recommendations of the subcommittee on program and budget authorization adopted by the committee have been so painstakingly documented and reasoned in their approach i attribute the great success of this effortand the important and oftneeded guidance it has provided the intelligence communityto the judgment and character of the ranking minority member ken robinson of virginia he has been the rock upon which the work of the subcommittee has been built and he deserves the thanks not only of the congr6ss but of the nation for his great contribution in this area i should also add that the staff who assist the committee in its consideration of the intelligence and intelligencerelated budgets is first class i believe they are the finest the most professional of all who work on the intelligence budget in either the executive or legislative branches i would like to pay tribute and thanks to duane andrews jim bush marty faga annette smiley and patrica garber as in the last

calculated by adding an amount up to 2 5 percent per year but not to exceed 115 percent to the reasonable value of the property as determined by the administrator the reported bill contains exception from any state law prohibiting interest on interest or requiring minimum amortization the objective of the loan guaranty program is to facilitate and encourage the extension of credit on favorable terms by private lenders to eligible veterans for the purchase construction repair alteration or improvement of homes to be occupied by veteran purchasers with the current rate of interest that must

being carried out under the most difficult of circumstancesas the fighting continues and even escalates on both sides the duarte government must be given due credit for making a reasonable effort to obtain the participation of the opposition forces in the election for instance it has permitted electronic campaigning by candidates to minimize the physical danger to which they might otherwise be exposed it has also ruled that political parties allied with the guerrillas may be registered for the electionbut still it should be noted those opposition groups have not been willing to submit their

agriculture committee has reported to meet reconciliation requirements of the first congressional budget resolution this bill is a valuable contribution to our overall effort to reduce government spending and provide much needed relief to the farmers of america it comes at a time when our farmers are literally fighting for their own economic survival and at a time when no other source of relief appears to be in sight from the effects of low prices high interest rates high production costs and failing farm policy the proposal to increase support prices and to setaside land from production in exchange for diversion payments is an example of how government farm programs designed to improve farm prices help the farm economy while causing a saving in federal expenditures the cost of the present farm policy will result in a higher takeover by increased farmer participation in the commodity credit corportation loan program the proposed setaside program with diversion payments will reduce supply increase market prices thereby reducing government loans deficiency payments storage costs and bankruptcy losses the result is an estimated net saving to the treasury of at least 3 3 billion but far more vitally important to the national interest will be the american farmers who survive this economic depression because congress responded to the national need of agriculture this congress must recognize the urgency of the situation in the farm sector even if the president will not the nations agricultural economy is in the worst economic depression in 50 years domestic farm prices reflect the effects of an economic program that has ripped to shreds any pretense of an economic safety net for farmers domestic net farm income in 1982 will be the lowest since 1932 and the level of farm foreclosures in 1983 will probably be the highest since that same period a half century ago let us review some of the facts that have persuaded the agriculture committee to present a plan for reduced crop production and reduced expenditures for agricultural programs for the next 3 years crop prices dropped every month in 1981 for an average decrease among major commodities of 14 percent livestock prices declined by an average of 10 percent in 1981 and have yet to regain the price levels of 197980 despite secretary blocks claim of economic recovery for livestock producers after modest upward price movement in the spring crop prices have now collapsed below the depressed levels of 1981 to a point unforseen by even the most pessimistic farm forecasters there literally is not a single farm crop among the grains and soy complex which will return a profit to farmers at this time no matter how efficient the farmer the july 30 issue of agricultural prices by usda which includes the parity price index showed the july parity levels of major farm commodities to be lower than during the great depression of the 1930s commodity percent of parity r ice 39 wheat 45 corn 50 cotton 4 7 soybeans 47 farm prices in the great depression generally did not decline below 50 per cent of parity burdensome supplies and depressed prices are a reflection of this adminis trations failed agricultural program there are almost 2 billion bushels of wheat and corn in the farmerowned grain reserve with no place to go and inadequate storage available for the 1982 crops the administration will spend almost 12 billion on the 1982 farm program and 1 billion of that will be the cost of storing grain with no known market the administration professes not to share the concern of those of us from the farming regions about the present danger of mass bankruptices and irretrievable loss of thousands of our most efficient agricultural producers in the coming months in the special order discussion of the farm problem on the house floor on may 4 i noted that our 2 4 million farmers had total debts of almost 200 billion much of that at short term high interest rates which cannot be repaid given the farm income realities of 1980 1981 and as has been widely reported net farm income has been shrinking rapidly for 3 years just as farm debt has ballooned in current dollars net farm income for each of the last 3 years including 1982 has been about half of the 1979 level while total debt is double that of 1975 the farmers home administration was justly embarrassed by the unprecedented levels of delinquency among its farm borrowers revealed earlier this year their policy of refinancing and subordination fo debts to other lenders has allowed most of those borrowers to continue to operate in 1982 but a day of reckoning is coming given current farm prices and farm income projections the january 1982 fmha data on farm loan borrowers showed that operating loan accounts were 38 percent delinquent and emergency loan accounts were 41 percent delinquent nationally in my state of arkansas the figures were 63 and 64 percent respectively i shidder to think what those figures will look like for january 1983 i have come to the same coaclusion reached by the agriculture committee that farm production nust be temporarily reduced if the current farm depression is ever to end it raakes no common sense to continue to pile up commodity surpluses when we have an economic program in effect which is constricting and strangulating our ef forts to expand agricultural exports farm exports will decline in value this year from about 44 billion in 1981 to 42 billion the first decline in a decade of export growth our storage facilities are full we have accummulated a full years production without any immediate market prospects for it and our taxpayers are being required to assist farmers in managing this huge inventory at a very high cost to all concerned we must restore economic policies that achieve moderation in interest rates and reduce the dollars overvaluation in relation to the currencies of our major foreign customers in order for our farm programs based on larger value and volume of agricultural exports to succeed because those policies which could successfully move our current surpluses into foreign markets are not working we have no choice but to cut production the bill h r 6892 can provide the needed incentives to reduce excess crop production and it will do so while reducing government outlays over the life of the bill it can succeed by giving the producer the economic incentive to take 20 percent of his land out of production in the case of rice and feedgrains and 25 percent in the cost of wheat it will make modest adjustments in the support program for dairy products which will achieve 3 3 billion savings in this program over 3 years it will save 70 million in the cotton and rice program over 3 years but will increase the costs of the wheat and feedgrain programs by 56 million over the same period according to the congressional budget office total savings in the bill over 3 years is 3 3 billion which meets the mandate of the first budget resolution to sum it up it will help farmers bring supply back in line with known demand and it will save money in

extent that it relies upon public works as a countercyclical tool it is impotent to do the job that is designed to do as a former chief counsel of the economic development administration i probably have as much or more experience as anybody in this house in trying to use a public works program as a countercyclical tool i will tell my colleagues it just does not work it will not work to solve the infrastructure problem which is immense and growing and it certainly is not going to work to solve the unemployment problem which is also immense and growing in trying to couple these two together i think we do a disservice i think it is hypocritical to suggest that a quickfix hurryup jobs program is in any way going to address the structural unemployment problem in this country the lpw program which i was involved in trying to administer 6 years ago was designed to try to resolve the recession of 197576 the money did not come on stream until 1977 and 1978 in fact today we are still spending money out of that local public works program of 6 years ago it may be helping to solve this years recession but it is not helping the recession that it was designed to help which was 7 years ago even if we address the problem and get the projects on stream in a reasonable time i tell you that the cost per job is outrageous the gao has done a study that shows that in the local public works programs the average cost per job was about 65 000 per job that sure is not cost effective in my book there has been much discussion on this floor recently as to what direction our nation should take to achieve the long sought after goal of economic recovery helping the over 12 million americans currently out of work must be a matter of the highest priority to this body but by help i do not mean the type of shortterm makework public works jobs programs that reportedly are being considered we owe it to those of our citizens who cannot find work to create a stable and healthy economy so that the jobs they do find will be permanent jobsjobs with a future this cannot be accomplished by a multibilliondollar countercyclical boondoggle it is the height of hypocrisy in my opinion to suggest that putting 400 000 or 600 000 or even a million people to work for 15 weeks or so is an answer to the unemployment of over 12 million that is political cynicism at its worst more than that it is bad economics because it is very likely to fuel the inflation that we have struggled so hard to bring under control experience with the local public works act of 1976 shows us the flaws in this approach the overall effect of programs of this type is relatively small the impact of the program comes too late to have any meaningful effect and in fact has an adverse effect because of the inflationary pressure created in the rush to use available grant money projects of relatively low priority to the community are frequently funded and the direct cost of each created job is outrageously high to

this involvement no meaningful economic recovery can take place the key to recovery lies in long term private sector jobs rather than temporary federally subsidized ones and federal resources should be dedicated to stimulating this kind of longterm growth rather than wasted on quick fix gimmicks that in the end only make things worse currently this legislation awaits the call to conference by the senate while in these waning days of this session the possiblity of that conference occurring is slight i am encouraged by my colleagues in the other body that next session will bring further dialog and more thorough consideration of this valuable component to a national economic recovery program the final element of the package that i would offer is the speedy consideration of the presidents

highly targeted method of providing the distressed community with the type of assistance that will enable it to attract private investment and move in the direction of selfsufficiency working in conjunetion with the national development investment act enterprise zone legislation would benefit the most highly distressed areas of the nation both rural and urban and is a necessary component to

repeat that we are leaving exactly the same protection for the sugar growers that exists in the law today in other words the secretary of agriculture at his discretion acts to protect the american

present price of sugar on the world market consequently if one is a grower of sugar obviously one would want to put his sugar in loan today the sugar would be put in loan at 18 cents a pound even

discharge petition no 13 for h r 5324 this bill rescinds the tax benefits provided during 1981 to members of congress for living expenses my bill represents a simple repeal of the unjustified tax break which congress passed last december i am using this extraordinary method of a discharge petition for two reasons first the ways and means committee informed me that it was unlikely that it would be able to review my bill or any similar legislation in the foreseeable future thus there appears to be little hope that my bill will be able to progress through the regular committee process second i believe that congress must act quickly to restore the faith of the american people in their representatives members of congress should be setting an example of fairness and austerity during these difficult economic times yet our citizens are losing confidence in the integrity of their congressmen because of the unjustified tax break which was passed last december by repealing this tax windfall we will show americans that we are willing to share in our obligations as taxpaying citizens and in so doing we will regain the trust and respect of those we represent i therefore urge ywn to sign my discharge petition no 13 and join me as a cosponsor of h r 314 you may also wish to sign discharge petitions for similar bills the gentleman from ohio chalmers wylie has petition no 14 and the gentlewoman from colorado pat schroeder has petition no 12"], [0.001143038272857666, 0.5011430382728577, 0, "in title xiv of the 1977 and 1981 farm bills the congress sought to halt decades of decline in federal funding and emphasis on research and education in the food and agricultural sciences it is no secret why america leads the world in the production of food fiber and forest products the effort to put our country in that leadership role began as far back as 1862 when our government entered into a longstanding commitment to endorse and support public expenditures at state landgrant colleges and universities for agricultural research and education programs for the extension of technical knowledge from the science laboratories to the user farmers and ranchers of this nation this effort also included as well programs that enhanced the living conditions and standards for farm and rural people and people throughout our country this commitment reached its climax in 1939 when approximately 39 percent of all federal research and development funds were allocated to agricultural research and education unfortunately by 1975 funds for agricultural research and education had sunk to approximately 2 percent of the federal r d budget fortunately for the american farmer and consumer these earlier efforts paid such rich dividends that our nation gained the capability to produce a cornucopia of food fiber and forest products far outstripping the capabilities of our competitors moreover our agriculture industry with only about 3 percent of the nations labor force as farmers produces such an abundance of food and fvber that our own people enjoy the best quality diet purchased with a smaller percent of disposable income of any people in the world in the history of man this remarkable feat has been made possible through extensive technological developments adopted by our farm producers and processors these developments and adoptions have as their basis the research and educational institutions our landgrant colleges and the 1890 institutions across the nation agriculture is one bright spot for america in the world marketplace while our nation is blessed with natural resources necessary for extensive agricultural production as well as a favorable climate in much of the nation the might and importance of the industry are dependent on other factors primarily past technological development we must continue to develop new technology if we are to maintain our world market position two decades ago most americans held the notion that products made in japan were cheap handmade trinkets with little durability what a change has taken placel where in the world will similar changes take place to enable farm producers to outcompete american producers only if we maintain a commitment to those factors that have enabled the american agricultural industry to grow in magnitude and importance will we maintain our ability to sell significant amounts of our production to the world and pay for the vast qualities of raw products we must import from other nations to fuel and feed our own industries and provide jobs for american labor and only by selling to the world market can we share in meeting the needs of hungry undernourished people of the world it is known that the worldwide demand for food and fiber will increase throughout tile rest of this century it is anticipated that people of the world will seek a better quality diet which will include more animal products in other areas of the world there have been examples of dramatic improvements in agricultural production india long riddled with famine is now producing enough wheat to meet most of its domestic needs this is a direct result of unitedstates wheat research advanced by normand borlaug at cimmyt in mexico and subsequently adapted in india similarly rice production in asia has significantly increased as a result of research at the international rice research institute in the philippines we in this nation have experienced approximatey a twofold increase in crop yields since 1940 largely a result of technology initiated over a century ago we know that there are substantial dividends for investments in technological developments in tuture agricultural production some have said that the importance of agriculture is equal to if not greater than that of our national defense system in regards to maintaining a strong competitive agriculture the soviet union and peoples republic of china are placing the highest priority on food production research with emphasis not only on output but on stable production from year to year we feel that the future of america can be no better than the future of the agricultural industry it is within the national interest to provide public support for agricultural research and education while we know there will be demand for farm products we should not take for granted the possibility that american agriculture will fill that demand without competition in most recent years productivity on american farms has been plateauing some of the reasons for this plateauing are soil erosion reduced soil organic matter soil compaction chemical residues more less productive land in production increased pressure on prime land for nonfarm uses fewer options for water fertilizer and pesticides increased regulatory constraints and decreased support for agricultural research and extension in real dollars this plateauing is not the result of not having any remaining potential to realize from continued research and education while approximately half of the agricultural reseach in the united states is funded with private funds we do not feel the nation should rely more heavily on this funding source furthermore many necessary projects would never be undertaken were we to rely on private initiative funding of food and agricultural research involves the expense of having things ready to go when research is required being prepared demands maintenance and replacement of research tools flocks herds barns feed milking parlors machinery field stations land orchards crops irrigation equipment and greenhouses we see a need for consistent formula funding of the hatch act as these funds are the basis for maintaining research systems benefits to farmers from research which reduces the cost of producing food fiber and forest products spill across county and state lines when we develop improved technology early acceptors and implementors benefit but in the long run the true benefactor is the american consumer research benefits everyone in the supermarkets therefore it is appropriate to maintain significant federal funding federal funds provide an element of federal influence this influence is in the form of coordination of efforts and results in minimizing duplications federal involvement also provides for upward and outward movement of information the usda science and education agenciesars csrs and extensionare examples of effective federal agencies further csrs and extension which manage federal state partnership research and education programs are federal agencies with relatively limited staffs that provide valuable coordination points for these programs the next generation of researchers and teachers and demonstrators have some exciting opportunities the results of their efforts can be even more dramatic than the results of the past researchers can keep american agriculture great with greater photosyn thetic efficiency improved biological nitrogen fixation genetic improvement and cell fusion techniques great er resistance to competing biological systems more efficiency in nutrient uptake and conversion reduction in losses from nitrification and denitrification greater resistance to environmental stresses and identification of hormonal systems and mechanisms to mention but a few areas chemically synthesized nitrogen fertilizer represents the largest single industrial input into agricultural production onethird of the fossile fuel energy consumed in food production is for this use each pound of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer requires an input of 30 cubic feet of natural gas when applied to the land much of this fertilizer can be lost to leaching by rain or to volitalization to the air the amount lost will depend on variance in the weather consider the significance of research that could result in a crop such as corn fixing nitrogen from the air solar energy is clean renewable and nonpolluting agriculture is the only major industry that directly depends on solar energy we farm the sun plants are literally biological sun traps and we ought to invest more of our resources to learn more about this magical process we recognize and agree with the need to reduce government spending we also recognize the dramatic returns available from investments in agricultural research and education we are convinced that the commitment should be increased and that the federal partner must participate in the increases we hope that the future will have increases even more extensive than those proposed by the administration in this years budget i am proud to report that the president and the secretary of agriculture are both in full support of the need for maintaining our leadership role in american agriculture now and into the future in this regard is is important to note that the only element of the fiscal year 1983 agriculture budget that received an increase was the research and education program moreover i havd been informed by secretary block himself that an outstanding scientist and leader in american agriculture for the position of assistant secretary of agriculture for research and education has been recommended to the president for nomination to the senate for confirmation further committing this administration to a strong agricultural research and education program to maintain and enhance our future role as the leader of the world in food fiber and forestry production at prices both beneficial to our farmers and ranchers and consumers both here at home and abroad e"]]}
