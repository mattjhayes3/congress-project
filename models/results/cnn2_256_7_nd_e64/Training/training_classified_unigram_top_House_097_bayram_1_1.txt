to the bill we had before us last year where we had a federal agency is now providing the most expeditious and the best way that it could possibly be handled but withdrawing any past opposition that i have to this concept i still hope that somewhere in this government we are going to move on and do even more in the field of product liability unlimited liability is one of the most serious problems that faces manufacturers in this country i am not a lawyer and i do not understand torts but they need to do about three things to improve product liability the first thing they need is to have a statute of limitations they cannot let these claims run on and on 20 years after you manufacture a product the second thing they cannot have the secondary or tertiary responsibility in other words if you manufacture a truck and someone hangs something on your truck a person should not be able to because of that little item that is on there sue the truck company the third thing is i think we should establish some reasonable limits on what courts and juries could give in the way of compensation in other words whatever they give in damages eventually comes back for us to pay as consumers and whatever we do should be fair and equitable completely across the country so i am asking that somewhereand possibly it is not within our committees jurisdictionwe establish asound way to once and for all give balance and give a final answer to this product liability this overwhelming problem that faces industry in america today as we all know many businesses particularly smaller businesses have experienced continuing problems in obtaining product liability insurance at a reasonable cost for several years now as documented during the energy and commerce committees extensive hearings this problem has taken a variety of forms it began in the midseventies when thousands of businesses were hit with sudden and substantial increases in the cost of their product liability insurance these increases were often opposite to the excellent claims experience of many of the businesses affected some businesses were also forced to accept deductibles that were so high they amounted to selfinsurance other businesses were unableto obtain product liability insurance at any cost ultimately an increasing number of businesses were forced to go without product liability insurance altogether either because it was unaffordable or unavailable this development not only meant that such businesses risked their assets to the ravages of future lawsuits but also that the future claims of injured consumers could go uncompensated as reported by the committee h r 2120 seeks to address the product liability problem in two ways first it permits product manufacturers sellers and distributors to form their own insurance cooperatives called risk retention groups so as to spread and assume all or a portion of their product liability and completed operations risk exposure second it enables such businesses to purchase product liability insurance on a group basis clearly this legislation represents a marketplace solution to the problem and should help alleviate the problem by providing an opportunity to reduce insurance costs for some businesses particularly smaller businesses and by promoting greater competition among insurers when they set product liability insurance rates and premiums however i do not believe that it addresses the root of the problem that is uncertainties in the tortlitigation system therefore i would like to take this opportunity to express my hope that we will soon proceed to address such uncertainties in the tortlitigation system with appropriate federal legislation the product liability problems associated with our current tort system are well documented in early 1976 pursuant to communications from the capital goods sector jn particular and other business sectors that a crisis had arisen in the area of product liability the ford administration formed an interagency task force on product liability after a year of extensive study the task force issued a final report which identified uncertainties in the tortlitigation system as a principal cause of the product liability problem the present tortlitigation system has produced a number of decisions which are moving away from a balanced system in which those who are injured by a product are reasonably compensated only by those who are at fault i would like to note several particularly troublesome areas first the imposition of principles of strict liability on some manufacturers relating to the design of the product and or warning about hazards connected with that product second excessive product liability costs for wholesalers retailers and distributors who are frequently brought into a product liability suit even though they usually act as a conduit by passing on a finished product unaltered in its original package third the absence of a cutoff point after which a manufacturer is no longer subject to liability for an injury caused by an older product and fourth the awarding of excessive punitive damages admittedly the consideration of these and other areas of the product liability tortlitigation system will have to be thorough because of the systems complexity but i would like to emphasize the need to promptly address these areas in uniform federal legislation i see such action as essential if we are to reach the root of the product liability problem"], [0.23838262259960175, 0.23838262259960175, 0, "first of all i want to thank the

member of this house before their vote is cast on this bill how can we create a program of foreign assistanceduty free one way tradewhen the united states is in the midst of the most severe economic recession since the great depression good question i had this same concern before i considered the specifics of this proposal now i am convinced that the caribbean basin initiative is in the best interest of america k the facts concerning the cbi are clear and well documented first the cbi is in the national interest of the united states the economic security of this country depends on a politically stable caribbean basin nearly onehalf of all unitedstates tradeincluding threequarters of our imported oilpasses through the region let us take this opportunity todayto address a growing atmosphere of instability before it is too late before more drastic measures are required second the caribbean basin initiative is a trade bill not an aid bill in september the congress approved a supplemental appropriation for fiscal year 1982 that contained 350 million as part of the economic aid component of the cbi the trade component probably the most important element of the initiative simply allows qualifying caribbean nations duty free access to unitedstates markets of course there are certain exceptions to protect unitedstates interests but again let us consider the documented factsnot the myths about the cbi the critics argue that the plan will cost american jobs i understand their concern i would not be here today supporting such an initiative if the bill detrimentally affected our economy especially during this recession however the reality does not support this concern the united states has a 2 billion trade surplus with the caribbean region and imports to the united stateq from this area amount to only 4 percent of total unitedstates imports the weak and struggling nations of the ciribbean could hardly damage the unitedstates economy finally let iie make one more observation last night we were subject to extensive debate on the immigration reform bill i do not want to diminish the importance of the legislation but members should examine the cbi in terms of immigration it is a fact the caribbean basin region is the second largest source of illegal immigration to the united states with better economic conditions the mass immigration will surely slow down the trade bill under consideration today is a wellbalanced program the bill combines a substantial economic stimulus to caribbean countries with essential and adequate safeguards for

to the growth of the unitedstates economy it is a proven fact that small businesses produce these innovations at a rate 24 times greater per research dollar than larger firms currently small businesses nationwide receive only an estimated 3 5 percent of all federal research and development funds given the fact that small firms are much more productive when it comes to producing results in the field of research and development does it not follow that we should channel more federal money to that sector i think we have a responsibility to the unitedstates taxpayer to insure that his money is spent where it will produce the best results the small business innovation act targets after a 4year phasein a maximum of 1 25 percent of the 43 billion of the federal research and development budget to fund initial work on innovative concepts by small companies if the small business commit tees substitute amendment is agreed to the setaside in 1982 dollars would amount to 377 million of

productive efficient component of the economy with a proven track record also i think it important to note that the method of awarding these research and development funds under the small business innovation program will be carried out on a truly competitive basis small businesses will be solicited to submit their research and development proposals to appropriate agencies after analysis those proposals which are deemed worthy will be partially funded so the companies involved will be able to further demonstrate the economic and technological feasibility of their concept review of proposals

review process has been successfully used by the national science foundation where 400 awards were made from 3 800 proposals that is true competition this bill will give the united states a proven

source fortynine percent of californias nontransportation needs are met with natural gas ninetythree percent of the househols use natural gas for water heating 91 percent use it for space heating and 95 percent use it for cooling clearly the availability of natural gas is critical to the economic wellbeing and energy security of my state therefore i was alarmned by a recent report issued by southern california gas co stating that natural gas supplies currently available to southern california will not be sufficient to serve the area fully by the 1980s given this project shortfall the

proven gas reserves additional potential gas reserves on alaskas north slope left to be discovercd are projected at 100 to 200 trillion cubic feet the alaska national gas transportation system will provide access to these proven reserves equivalent to at least 400 000 barrels of oil per day with potential energy supplies of perhaps 10 times that amount the 4 800 mile pipeline will transport natural gas through alaska and canada to nearly every state in the union and will have an initial capacity to provide over 4 percent of our nations daily natural gas needs the angts will provide a stable and reliable supply of energy to this country a supply thant ill not be subject to opec embargoes or escalating prices at a projected total cost of 40 billion the pipeline will be the most expensive private construction project ever conceived last may the angts financing plan was presented to four unitedstates commercial banks for consideration in august the four bank group advised that although the project rould be privately financed without governmental guarantees and or participation certain steps must be taken to modify the financial requirements established under the 1976 alaska natural gas transportation act this act had specifically provided for the waiver of federal laws if necessary to facilitate success of the project the commercial banks told thle pipeline sponsors that unless these financial modifications or waivers wvere approved reliable private sector financing could not be secured for the project in other words the pipeline will not be built unless these waivers of law as proposed to congress by president reagan on october 15 and contained in senate joint resolution 115 are approved the most controversial provision of the waiver package is the one which would permit prebilling senate joint resolution 115 would permit billing of unitedstates gas consumers for the construction costs of the pipeline before the pipeline is fully operational the federal energy regulatory commission ferc would establish a date certain for expected completion of the entire project probably 1987 for the purpose of thle waiver the system wvould be divided into three segments canada alaska and the conditioning plant at prudhoe bay each of which would have specific billing schedules if any one or two of these three segments of the pipeline were completed before the entire pipeline but after the date certah consumers at the discretion of ferc could be prebilled for the completed segments the argument has been raised that this prebilling proposal would lock consumers into multibillion dollar payments whether or not the pipeline is ever completed this is simply not the case the prebilling provision of the waiver proposal gives ferc the discretionary power to allow companies decembet 10 1 981 planning to move gas through the project to begin billing gas customers first only after a date selected by ferc as reasonable completion of the entire system probably 1987 second only after full completion and testing of one of two of three basic segments of the line third only for the debt service and related costs on the unitedstates sements of the project fourth only after billions of dollars of the sponsors own risk capital has been invested without return until project completion and fifth only for those costs prudently incurred and actually paid the absolute worst case consumer financial risk a highly unlikely contingency of utter project failure after completion of the two most expensive segments of the system would involve average consumer payments of less than 1 per month during the 20 years required to discharge the debt in full one oil embargo or a revolution would add far more to consumer energy bills in contrast given a worst case scenarlo unitedstates private sponsors of the project would lose all their equity investment in such a case big business would be the big losersnot the consumers furthermore in the event of any delay beyond the date certain assuming ferc has approved the prebilling as just and reasonable any payments by consumers would serve to reduce and lower their later payments when the system is finished consumers would under no circumstances be asked to pay for sections of the system that are not completed approval of the waiver package also fulfills a national commitment to canada in july 1980 president carter informed prime minister trudeau that he would ask congress to allow the participating canadian companies to collect their full service costs upon completion of the canadian segment of the line in july 1980 congress expressed its unqualified support for the project in a formal resolution s con res 104 canadas national energy board relied upon this presidential and congressional support when it acted to permit new gas exports and construction of the prebuild segments in canada reneging on this commitment by not building the alaskan section of the pipeline would be extemely detrimental to relations with canada what the whole issue boils down to is this no waiver package means no pipeline without acceptance of the waiver package it will be impossible to obtain private sector financing for what is universally regarded as an invaluable and even essential project lack of private financing support would either lead to the projects abandonment or force outright government financing the only way to insure private sponsorship and funding of this pipeline project so vital to our national energy interest is to approve the waiver package as contained in senate joint resolution 115 e"],

the real target here let us not put our eyes on the hole instead of the donut we have a clear choice here between the grammlatta amendment and the committee bill the committee bill is a pretty good bill i have nothing but praise for chairman jones and subcommittee chairman panetta and their associates i think they worked hard and produced a good product the only trouble with it is it does not go quite far enough toward achieving that balanced budget in 1984 without real difficulty according to the figures i have from cbo the grammlatta amendment will save this country in outlays over the 3year period 5 billion and in budget authority 8 billion more importantly it takes us into the block grants and the permanent cuts therefore it is much more desirable for the economic health of the nation than the committee bill more importantly than that the office of management and budget sees this as a 14 billion improvement rather than a 5 billion because it is concerned about what we have described in much of our debate here as phantom cuts the latta amendment on the other hand takes us closer to our own budget resolution closer to the other bodys bill which was passed late last night closer to what our president has asked of us and closer to what our constituents have asked of us most importantly this takes us closer to that balanced budget in 1984 i would invite each member here if possible to raise his or her sights above the indignity of a late somewhatflawed hardtofollow bill above the indignity of the heat of this debate and to think instead to raise their sights to that 5 billion savings i would ask my colleagues to think instead about inflation about high interest rates and to think about a balanced budget and to think about their constituents if they do i think they will want as i do to cast a vote for an economically stronger america a vote for the taxpayers a vote for the grammlatta amendment the latta amendment to the reconciliation bill is said to achieve nearly about 22 billion in real budget savings over the next 3 years the committee bill h r 3964 in my judgment while a good effort does not make enough permanent spending reductions so that a balanced budget will be attainable in 1989 without great difficulty therefore i believe it is essential that house pass the latta amendment and i shall vote for it most of the debate today has centered on the procedures and the late publication of the amendment i dont like the procedure either unfortunately the parliamentary situation is the creation of those who are complaining the loudest i dont like closed rules although they are sometimes necessary i dont like waivers of points of order abuse of suspensions restrictions on debate and allthe limitations used to stiffle the will of the house the majority in this house has used all these devices and is clearly responsible for the present parliamentary snaggle the tardiness of the minority in providing copies of the amendment to all members is also regrettable this is surely not the first time such a thing has happened i can remember well the tax redt tion act of 1976 nevertheless i believe the entire house is embarassed whenever we have to make decisions without having a reasonable amount of time to review and analyze the legislation again however the problems we face today are a product of the process begun 4 months ago the committee bill h r 3964 has unfortunately fallen short of the savings that were needed to reach the balanced budget by 1984 none of the presidents proposals for block grant programs were included phantom cuts specifically in food stamps and dairy supports but in others as well were claimed as real savings many spending cuts are temporary rather than permanent in my judgment some committees did a fine job in the reconciliation some did so willingly some just did their duty under the obligation of the budget resolution another group few in number did poorly most of the changes in the latta amendment are directed against the work of those few committees actually the work of a majority of committees is untouched by the amendment the question of immediate substance here is the need to reduce spending the latta amendment comes closer to fulfilling the bromise of the budget resolution or of a balanced budget than the committee bill does that is the prime consideration it was easy to vote for the budget resolution over 250 of us did so it was a vote on aggregates this vote on reconciliation is the hard one here we must vote on real programs there are mistakes in both the committee bill and the latta amendment but there have been mistakes in every major bill we have passed there are features i do not like or support in both versions today but that is also true of most comprehensive bills we consider despito obvious flaws and personal objections i see no alternative to voting for the latta amendment a more enduring question of process today is what happens to reconciliation or the budget act for my part i think that a noble precedent is being developed for 6 years we have abused the budget process at least we have not used it to save any of the taxpayers money in the past you however the congress has discovered and successfully developed the reconciliation process this year we actually got tough on the budget resolution itself certainly we have been

increase come from and flnally i would like to talk about the choice we face here today we wrote a budget in may a year ago that set out a path toward a balanced budget and reduced federal spending in that budget we assumed that after 18 months of economio stagnation that we were going to have a steady economic recovery those same assumptions were present in the house budget committees budget those same assumptions were made by cbo and omb and every economic consulting firm of any stature in america the only problem was that crippled by high interest rates the economy fell into a recession 5 months before any budget cut or any tax cut went into effect as unemployment went up as economic growth went down the deficit soared a 1percentage point rise in unemploymentsends the deficit up by 38 billion so the american people went to bed one night looking at a 42 billfon deficit they woke up the next morning i am sure at least as they perceive it and the deficit was over 150 billion the question now is what are we going to do about it i have heard people call this ronald reagans tax package that is not true if you look at the february 8 budget ronald reagan sent to this body a budget that called for 6 billion in new revenues in 1983 13 billion in new revenues in 1984 13 billion in new revenues in 1985 all coming from closing of loopholes in the tax code the president asked for 350 billion of spending cuts this body and the other body rejected the presidents program out of hand we have an alternative presented by the budget committee that called for 151 9 billion of taxes an actual increase in entitlements by putting back some of the cuts we made last year and no significant reduction in discretionary spending we were not able through the first round to adopt a budget in the second round we fought for 6 weeks to come up with a budget that did two things that no 1 had a low deficit and that no 2 did not raise taxes beyond acceptable limits and finally one that had acceptable levels of cuts after all that effort we adopted the bipartisan recovery budget that called for 98 billion worth of new taxes in terms of the revenue figures carried in that budget so whose tax increase is this it is our tax increase we have already voted on it once when we adopted the budget now there are those who keep saying let us cut more let us cut more i am willing to cut more i voted for the rousselot amendment i voted last year for the grammlatta budget and when we had the vote on minimum benefits for social security i stood up with five other people to stick with those cuts i would lik to know where all these cutters were when we votedon eliminating the minimum benefit on social security the plain truth is we could not cut any more and get 218 votes i was once asked by someone in the media how i decided how much to try to cut as if there was something arbitrary about it i pointed out it is pretty straightforward it takes 218 votes to pass a budget if we get 219 we did not cut enough if we get 217 we got greedy and we did not get anything we passed the budget by two votes i say how much we cut is now an old dead issue we cut as much as we could the question now is arewe going to live up to the budget we passed we conservatives in both parties have had the luxury for a long time to protest to cast votes on the basis of what we wished the congress and the country were really like now we have a tacit majority and the time has come to stop the protesting and to start the governing we faced a hard choice a difficult choice an unpleasant choice the choice is between raising revenues as a linchpin to get 280 billion worth of savings or to accept a 200 billion deficit now i have never had one of my constituents come up and say raise my taxes my mail is running overwhelmingly against the socalled tax increase but nobody is writing me saying accept the 200 billion deficit either we now have to make a fundamental decision and i would like to address my final remarks to those who share my conservative philosophy it seems to me we reach a point where we have to make a tough decision and that is do we want to be judged on the basis of how we vote or on the basis of what happens to the country for me i think we have reached the point where we have go to go ahead and take the best budget we are going to get i do not want to tell my grandchildren 50 years from now that everything went to hell in washington but i want you to know i voted against it every step of the way i want to be able to tell them that in a critical time in our history when we

priorities set for cleanup are not just problems of what is present it involves questions of whether what is present is a danger to the public health everything cannot be cleaned up at once some sites are more dangerous than others the dioxin site in missouri was one of the three sites focused on in the contempt proceedings in the energy and commerce committee had epa rushed to judgment it would have done so with three data points showing dioxin concentrations at 500 parts per billion in an area involving six residences basically there were some reservations about going ahead and moving thousands of yards of dirt or burning thousands of yards of dirt for hundreds of residences in this area given only three data points even with these concentrations of dioxin well beyond the 1 part per 1 billion standard an assessment of the health effects of these concentrations showed that a small child ingesting a teaspoon a day of this contaminated soil would take some 7 years to possiblyshow symptops of chloracne later 312 samples were taken and 120 homes thought possibly to be contaminated contained no detectable dioxin many members have got up tonight and implied that we are close to going under in a sea of hazardous chemicals and implied that only strong action by congressional investigations will save the american people from the threat this just is not the case and we should not mislead the american people to believe that only powerful action on the part of the members of this body or certain members of this body will save them from the hazards of chemical dumps it will take much hard work by people who know how to clean up and properly dispose of such chemicals it will take chemists chemical engineers technicians and workers time and money but it also takes something else a climate which is dispassionate and allows sound technical and scientific judgments to be made is essential if we are to effectively deal with hazardous waste dumps not all will be cleaned up at once priorities will be set those priorities should not be set only by litigators and politicians by newspaper and tv reporters no they should also be set by public health specialists medical doctors scientists and engineers who can use the resources available most effectively without being buffeted by abundant emotionalism here is a part of the record on superfund thus far epa has
