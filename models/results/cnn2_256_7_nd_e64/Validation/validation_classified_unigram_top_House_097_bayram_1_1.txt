ranking minority member the gentleman from california and the gentleman from pennsylvania the subcommittee chairman and ranking minority member respectivelywho have all played an important part in bringing this important bill to the floor today i remind my colleagues that the full funding for the bridge is the same as provided for in an amendment which i offered to last years federal highway

this time to me and i thank her for her work on this bill and also the hard work that the gentleman from mississippi has put into this bill let me start my remarks by pointing out as the gentleman from virginia pointed out before me that only about half of this bill concerns itself with agriculture there is no doubt that that most productive element of our economy needs to have some support from this level of government and i would hope that the people who are focusing on this particular piece of legislation will focus on the fact that it is really in two parts one devoted to agriculture that we have heard a lot about today but the other part devoted to welfare the food stamp program and others like it i make that mention because when we get to the welfare area there have been some very inventive things done in this particular bill we have heard a lot of talk today about the fact that this bill comes in under budget that we have met the budget targets that we have done all these things well in fact we have except we just have not funded the programs for the full year i mean it is a little like the family that finds itself with 15 000 of income and 20 000 of expenses what they say is well ok fine we have only 15 000 worth of income so we will only pay our bills for threequarters of the year we will only pay them through september and we will let the other 3 months go and we have thereby balanced our budget that is exactly what we are doing in this particular bill we are saying fine we cannot fund the programs adequately for the full year so we will only do them for part of the year and then come in later on for a supplemental appropriation and expand the spending there by how much the congressional budget office estimates that for the programs that we have not funded for the full year that it is going to cost us about an extra billion dollars added on that does not put us under budget that puts us over budget in my opinion all of a sudden more than 50 percent of the money in this bill is going for welfare costs rather than for agriculture so i am concerned about the fact that we have this very inventive kind of budget philosophy embodied to this bill as i say we did not do that over in the agriculture area those programs are funded through september 30 it is primarily in the food stamp where this is affected what that means is that 9 5 billion that the administration requested in going to be covered in this bill yes but only for the first several months of the year and then afterward we are going to have to find more money to the tune of how much maybe 1 billion maybe 1 2 billion i think that this bill gives us good reason to question exactly the kind of appropriations process that we are engaging in in this house it is the reason why earlier today for instance i raised the question about the continuing resolution and some of the rest we find ourselves in a cituation where we are being told that we are coming in under budget that we are complying with the budget only to find in the details of the bill that in fact we have found a way to get around the budget commitments so when the appropriate moment comes in the case of the food stamp program i am going to offer a very simple amendment to take the funding in this bill that matches the presidents request and instead of cutting it off on july 15 of next year we go clear through to september 30 with that amount of money then we would really be within the budget an extremely appropriate amendment and i hope that it would be passed"], [0.2229704111814499, 0.2229704111814499, 0, "i wish i could say in closing the debate on our side that this debate this afternoon and this morning has been constructive but i cannot this is a very very important issue as has been pointed out by the gentleman fr9m minnesota and the gentleman from alabama it is a question of whether or not we turn the country around economically or whether we do not why do i say the debate has not been constructive first it started off on the wrong foot because we had a situation occur with the printing of our bill that just should not have occurred and everyone in this house knows about it now so i do not want to repeat it but i hope as long as i serve in this body we will never have that happen again that no one no one will go up to the bill room and get a bill before it goes to the printer and tear it apart and put it back in such a way that we have had in this bill and the delayed printing of a proper bill so that they would have a photocopy i have talked to my good friend from texas and certainly he will speak to that issue that is not going to happen again in this house that should not have happened this time but it did and you cannot blame us for not having a printed bill when that printed bill could not have been given to us because of that delay caused by a couple of individuals on that side so let us not have that happen again let me say it has not been constructive from this point do my colleagues realize that the committee bill the committee bill which i have in my hands 497 pages which comes from all of the committees of this house has not even been really debated and our democrat friends are ready to vote on it i thought perhaps we would hear from the democratic committee chairmen this afternoon as we did on our side title by title and tell the members of this house what is in your package what is in your package you are saying that you do not know what is in our package you do not know what is in your package it has not been explained it has not been explained to the american people i think that your argument falls on deaf ears when the real truth of the matter comes out you do not know what is in your own package for example military retirees you take credit in your figures for taking cola away from military retirees on the provision that they do likewise for the civilians let me also say they take credit for a food stamp cap and we just voted on tuesday to remove a food stamp cap and they take credit for a savings in that how ridiculous sure we are below the first year in what the gentlemans committee put together as the jones package and all they did was assemble what came from the individual committees tied a string around it and sent it in but they had it printed in proper form we did not intervene and attempt to get a copy of it and to mess it up on the way to the printer we did not do that and we never will mark my word let me also say that this is a critical issue the president of the united states is interested in it we had on our side our ranking members our leadership on the committees went down title by title and explained what was in our bill we had no explanation as to what is in this democrat package put out by the full committee and it is more comprehensive goes into greater detail and i will bet half of the membership has not even looked at the panetta himself says the cuts are in your bill in that committee package and you are ready to vote on it i say that we need a little more light on what the committee has done to america in this package and we have not gotten any light on this from the majority side my budget colleagues did not hold any hearings on it and they do not know what is in it and they said in the budget committee all we do is put it in a bundle tie a string around it and

necessary bill if the amendment to include funding for h r 6294 single housing production act of 1982 is adopted i urge my colleagues to disapprove the expected amendiient to fui i the program under h r 6294 on this irgent supplemental appropriations bill for 1982 this amendment is a product of partisan gamesmanship and is not in the best interest of this nation this amendment would allow an appropriation for the housing bill that was only passed yesterday that bill has not been passed by the senate nor signed by the president it seems that the paktisan leadership in this house in its view of the world has decided to put the cart before the horse furthermore the bill that was passed yesterday and for which this amendment at tempts to appropriate funds today shows to any clearheaded observer that this congress is not determined to change its ways 40 years of fiscal irresponsibility and stopgap measures designed to buy votes there is no doubt that the housing industry is on the verge of collapse if not already there but what is the cause of that problem it is the unrelenting growth in the consumption by the federal government of credit to finance a trillion dollar debt and a debt service that is now larger than the entire 1963 budget right now this government under laws passed by congress is consuming almost half of all the available credit in the market that is credit that is needed to expand replace machinery and put back to work all the carpenters factory workers plumbers and salesmen that are out of work the bill that was passed yesterday h r 6294 would have us start a program of interest subsidies for homebuilding certainly the sentiment is correct but the method is not only incorrect but deadly in terms of its effect on our already crippled economy that program which obligates a billion dollars for an interest buydown program must be funded with all the other programs in our 800 billion budget where is the money going to come from as i see it there are only three possibilities we can raise taxes print more money or borrow it the first alternative raising taxes does not seem likely we have managed to pick the pooyte of the taxpayer pretty clean over the past few years the second alternative printing money would put us back into the crippling inflationary spiral which we have only recently learned to control the last borrowing is probably what will happen that is just the very type of action that has crippled the housing industry it is not inflation that is keeping interest rates up it is the federal governments astounding consumption of credit which bids up the price of the remaining credit to all those businesses which need to expand or even to get off the ground to provide the jobs for our unemployed in addition this program which would have us embark on more borrowing would create a new bureaucracy if there is anything that has been made clear by the american taxpayer over the last few years it is that they do not want more bureaucracy finally what will be the benefits of the program we are told that this program will create 75 000 new housing units compared to the demand level now of over 2 million that is a mere drop in the bucket if we are to actually ielp the housing industry we must do so in a manner which will not add more fuel to the credit fire that is now burning down the housing industry i have introduced a bill 1 r 4833 the national home ownership bonds bill which does that very thing this bill would authorize lending institutions to issue national home ownership bond bills which would have a face yield of 1f percent the funds secured by the sale of these bonds would be earmarked for 12 percent mortgages the investor in the bond would receive a tax incentive which would make the bond equivalent to a 14 percent taxable inst rument this is a tax incentivfe program for housing it is not a governmental subsidy it will not require any outlays from the treasury and indeed will produce far more in tax revenue than any possible tax forgoence needed to start it up more importantly the program outlined in h r 4833 will not crente any longstanding obligations it is in a sense a selfdestructing piece of legislation that will only be triggered on need if we are to convince the people in the market and the taxpayer that this congress is serious about bringing down interest rates that this congress is serious about preserving the economic opportunities that have made this nation great then it is important that we sever ourselves from the actions of the past the appropriations for the program outlined in h r 6294 will only bring us more of the misery that we have managed to create in the past i urge my colleagues to join with me and vote against funding of this amendment and support the national home ownership bond program h r 4833 we need a strong housing industry but we need a strong industry that is active in a healthy economy not one that is propped up by congressionally mandated subsidy programs"], [0.25694841146469116, 0.25694841146469116, 0, "i want to join in the long list of colleagues who have commended the gentlewoman from colorado the gentleman from texas and the gentlemar from virginia on their longstanding support of this concept they have been real champions for the rights of divorced spouses i would also like to commend the officers and members of the national military wives association for the excellent job they have done in presenting their case it is truly a worthy cause and i have deep sympathy for divorced spouses we heard in the hearings we did hold many sad stories and i am a sponsor of the bill that the gentleman from virginia drafted there are a lot of arguments in support for divorced spouses some have been mentioned and some have not they have frequently played a significant role in their husbands careers they have had to endure frequent moves i checked with the military to find out how frequent that was and it is as many as 10 to 12 moves in a 20year career they have had little opportunity to further their education they have little opportunity to hold jobs or to even get good jobs because of the transient nature of their lives then too they have often accepted lowpaying jobs because of that they could not provide continuity in their employment and often suffered poor career advancement for that reason but in addition to the poor work environment they spend many hours of deep concern about the welfare of their husbands especially husbands who are involved in combat they very frequently suffer poorer living conditions than spouses who are not married to military members they have had to pay higher rents they have had forced sales of furniture long periods of family separation and very frequently they have had to act as both parents when their husbands were awayhad to be both father and mother to the children as they were growing up so i conclude that they deserve far better treatment than they have been receiving and i want to certainly help them receive more equitable treatment equity i feel is the theme of this bill but not just equity for divorced spouses even though the scales have been balanced unfairly on one side for many many years i do not feel we should unbalance them on the other side in an attempt to remedy this situation i think we must also provide equity for the members of the service what we want is the best most equitable bill for both parties i agree with the gentleman from alabama the chairman of our subcommittee that we probably are acting prematurely as the chairman has stated we have not held as many hearings as we would like although we have had an opportunity perhaps through the years to do so we have not received sufficient testimony i would hate to pass a bill that the congress will attempt to amend 29 times next year because we acted prematurely this year but i also appreciate the realities of the legislative situation it is late in the session the train is leaving the station the votes are here for this concept and there is no opportunity to postpone or to hold further hearings to improve the legislation s as chairman nichols stated he and i have done what we think is the next best thing tried to incorporate as many of the improvements that we fecl would have been addressed had we had more opportunity to put the bill in final form our amendment to the schroeder amendment as the chairman has stated would limit jurisdictions for divorce it would limit provisions of the bill to marriages of 10 years of more permit garnishment of nonpayment of property settlements terminate payments if spouse remarries before age 60 it also honors court orders prior to the mccarty decision it provides improved health care for spouses and finally it provides commissary and exchange provisions to divorced spouses i think these are good amendments we feel that this makes a good program that mrs schroeder has offered even better a more equitable program not only for the spouse but also for the service members and i would urge my colleagues support"], [0.2672162353992462, 0.2672162353992462,

rise to voice somb discomfort about the conference report which i cannot in good conscience support because i share the belief of two of our colleagues members of the appropriations committee that it incorporates an unconstitutional delegation of authority to the appropriations committee last week when the house first considered house joint resolution 599 the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from oklahoma both brought to the attention of the house a provision which is as outrageous as it is illegal and illegitimate that provision is the one which deems those general appropriation measures which have simply been reported from the appropriations conmittee to be considered as passed by the full house i share their view that that is an impermissible delegation of authority one of the results of this provision however is more troublesome it would appear to effectuate a legislative rider contained in the appropriations bill on treasury postal service and related agencies h r 7158 which was reported on september 22 1982 that rider purports to restrict interference by omb in the regulatory activities of the regulatory agencies i do not think it means anything and it has no legislative effect but some of these conditions that are put in appropriation measures and are given false life by the continuing resolution need to be examined by this house by this body before they are given some sort of a semilegal status in the absence of any further legislative language to define what is meant by interference it is worth remembering that the courts presume that agencies are properly conducting their activities the report language accompanying this provision does not specify any examples of what is meant by interference and thus at most this provision imposes no further restrictions upon the activities of the office of management and budget than otherwise existed then their ability to carry out their statutory duties under the paperwork reduction act of 1980 and under executive order 12291 having to do with regulatory oversight continue in effect and ar not touched by this if there is any different interpretation that should be placed upon

must pass a budget resolution i think in a spirit of cooperation and i want to stress the cooperation in view of the fact of what we have pending in the spirit of cooperation i believe that we can pass a budget resolution that the country so badly needs i know there is going to be a lot of partisanship exhbited during the next several hours and maybe during the next couple of days but this is good it will point up the differences between the parties as well as the resolutions and we ought to point up those differences but certainly we have to keep in the back of our minds that we have to pass a resolution we have to pass a resolution with which we can go to conference we have to pass something that we can be proud of and something that will do the job that is needed to be done for the country i think most people in this chamber will agree that the biggest job we have before us is the matter of bringing down interest rates i heard some of the statements made earlier today about the chairman of the federal reserve mr volcker he cannot do it all himself the big problem is right here in this congress are we going to continue spending and spending and borrowing and borrowing and taxing and taxing this is a question we have to decide if we want to continue on the way of the past we are not going to bring interest rates down no way the package that i have presented here is a bipartisan package hammered out through several long hours and everything is not to my liking in that package if i had written the substitute all by myself it would be written differently in a good many areas but this is a consensus that we have arrived at we have heard a lot about cutting cutting there has been many stories printed in the newspaper and there has been a lot of talk over television that we are cutting the budget you know and i know we are not cutting spending from fiscal year 1982 even the budget the bipartisan budget substitute now before the house is 39 6 billion more more not less more than fiscal year 1982 we are not cutting from fiscal year 1982 we are adding to that spending it is a question of how much do you add how much can you add and still bring down those interest rates certainly i was pleased as was everyone looking at the financial page today to see that the interest rates have dropped a little bit just within the last day they have got to drop a lot more but i was pleased to see that treasury bills fell to 11 48 on 26year bills this is a good beginning it is good to know that several major banks cut their broker loan rate to 14 75 from 15 50 a move that could foreshadow a decline in the prime rate from 16 50 but certainly what is starting now is not going to continue if we say here in this house today tomorrow or the next day that we cannot reduce spending and borrowing we cannot resist that temptation to say yes yes yes to every request being made we are not going to bring down those interest rates on the contrary they will probably start back up i know my colleagues are going to go back home and say we are doing everything we can to reduce interest rates because it is hurting everybody certainly what we do here on this floor will have some influence i am confident of that but if we merely do a little tinkering here and a little tinkering there we are not going to accomplish much so we have to show the country and those people who are deeply involved with these interest rates that we mean business about reining in deficit financing the recovery package we have introduced on a bipartisan basis will have the best chance of bringing down interest rates it is 76 billion deficit reduction package which slows the growth of spending by 56 billion in fiscal year 1983 and adds 20 billion in revenues certainly it is a resolution which if adopted will slow the seemingly unquenchable appetite for government spending and will lead the country back to economic recovery i need not tell the members of this house that this package has the backing of the president of the united states as he expressed last night and has support on both sides of the aisle it is truly a bipartisan package this package spends less money overall than the other 2 plans that we will be considering later on it provides more money for the buildup of our national defenses which we started last year it also raises fewer taxes than either of the other two it protects the fundings for critical programs for the poor the elderly and the unemployed yes and it does provide a reconciliation date the others do not this bipartisan recovery budget calls for a minimum revenue increase over the next 3 years of 95 billion by contrast both of the other alternatives increase taxes by greater amounts during the next 3 years the jones or the committee version calls for 147 billion in tax increases while the socalled coalition or aspin package would increase taxes by 135 billion thato 135 billion tax increase in the coalition budget could cancel the 33 percent of the 3year tax reduction voted by the congress last year the bipartisan package would protect those individual income tax reductions made last year and which will be further reduced on july 1 this year by 10 percent and july 1 next year by another 10 percent when you add the social security tax increases scheduled for the next 3 yearsand the taxes called for in the aspin and jones budgetsit adds up to a 247 billion total increase in taxes for the american working person almost a quarter of a trillion dollar increase both the jones and the aspin budgets would mean either the elimination or deferral of the 10 percent individual income tax cut in july of 1983 they would also require reductions in the business tax incentives for investments productivity and jobs supporters of the coalition and jones budget will tell you their resolutions do not require doing anything with the individual mcome tax and business tax cuts they probably will say that specific revenue increases will be made by the ways and means committee true true but there is no way to raise the kind of money they are talking about without taking the measures i have just outlined why are their tax increases so high well because their spending is high because they insist on spending more and more money they must raise taxes if the coalition resolution revenue increases were cut back to the 95 billion level that is in our resolution it would mean a 40 billion increase in their deficit over 3 years so to reduce the deficit we will need to slow the growth of government spending the bipartisan recovery budget does that in a fair and a balanced way now let me point out at this juncture that we deal in aggregatesaggregatesin the budget committee we do not mandate anything other than those aggregates until we get to reconciliation and then we tell the committees how much money they have to raise or reduce their spending but we are merely showing the way as to how you can get to where we have to go let me say we freeze all nondefense discretionary spending programs at the 1982 level and then add back money for programs we believe additional spending is warranted and slow spending for programs we believe are growing too rapidly and not needed for example the bipartisan budget provides 139 million moremorefor compensatory education for disadvantaged children than does the jones budget we add 50 million more than the jones budget for handicapped education and 78 million more for education block grants we increase energy conservation spending by 166 million we spend 45 million more than the jones budget on vocational education we spend 217 million more on elementary and secondary education we spend 107 million more on ceta it provides 13 million or 59 percent more than jones for the energy regulatory activities it adds 23 million or 55 percent to jones for energy research it exceeds the presidents january request by 6 1 billion for medicaid 6 1 billion for medicald than was in the presidents request it provides for 3 7 billion or 68 percent more than the president requested for public assistance it adds 2 7 billion more than the president requested for guaranteed student loans now there have been a lot of stories being spread around this capitol buildingand that this is not unusualthat the bipartisan recovery budget cuts the funds appropriated in the 1982 emergency housing supplemental we heard a little about this earlier this simply is not true in fiscal years 1983 1984 and 1985 we have just as much for this program as do the other alternatives in the allowance function the letter from alice rivlin has been read but let me just point out that there was an error certainly by alice rivlin when we submitted that amount of money and she came back with a letter admitting her mistake furthermore our budget provides for 1 billion ginne mae tandem mortgages just as is contained in the house budget committee proposal this amount of money is contained in our housing function contrary to the erroneous reports being circulated also in the housing area authority our proposal contains exactly the same for farmers home administration as does the house budget committee proposal in our case funds are recorded differently because it assumes certificates of benefit ownership are to be sold to the federal financing bank which issues these loans in its own name once again erroneous information was issued which must be corrected we have received a letter from the cbo which admits an error was made in removing the 1 billion out of the resolution and this letter from alice rivlin has already been read so i am not going to take the time of the house to reread t we have however asked for and expect to receive a similar letter from cbo regarding the 1982 supplemental request under the entitlements entitlements are the fastest growing segment of the federal budget in this important area the bipartisan recovery budget achieves savings of approximately 34 billion more than twice the savings contained in the coalition package which calls for entitlement reform of only 16 billion the coalitions 16 billion in entitlements savings amounts to only 1 4 percent of the current law entitlement spending of 1 2 trillion the bipartisan resolution contains only 6 9 billion in entitlement savings in the first year certainly as you look at the amount involved we ought to have more savings than the resolution now before us contains 1 it contains more savings than either the other two propositions these savings are accomplished while still allowing full costofliving increases for social security railroad retirement benefits veterans pensions and compensation our proposal calls for cost of living increases to be capped at 4 percent for fiscal year 1983 and 1984 1985 i understand an amendment will be offered by the gentleman from virginia to give these federal employees and federal retirees the same cost of living as the individuals on social security railroad retirement benefits and others but our provision as far as capping these individuals i have mentioned the federal retirees and the federal employees is the same as the budget committee entitlement savings are critical and if we fall to slow their rapid increase and we are not doing much in any of these packages including the one now before us we are not going to be able to control government spending in the manner in which we should in the well of the house is one example of the tremendous growth in our entitlement programs this is hhs programs from 1950 to 1984 in 1950 we start up with only 12 5 billion we get to 1970 my colleagues can see that it is above 35 billion then it starts almost right straight up now we are up to 108 1 billion in 4 years a tremendous increase in this one department alone the bipartisan budget assumes some medicare savings here is someplace where a lot of misinformation has been put out by you know who in this chamber because every time you talk of any kind of savings they always try to bring in that the elderly people are going to get hurt nothing nothing in these savings is going to touch the recipient in any substantial way at all but savings we must have and the committee recognized that as does the coalition budget recognize some savings must be made in medicare medicare savings in our proposal over 3 years 3 years will be 23 2 billion compared to the coalition budget medicare savings of 9 4 billion without any reform at all in this one particular program medicare costs will total over 200 billion for the next 3 years to give the members some idea of the magnitude of this increase that is nearly as much as the entire cost of this program during its first 15 years of existence up to 1980 let me repeat that this 200 billion for this one program for the next 3 years 200 billion is nearly as much as the entire cost of the program durinf its first 15 years of existence from 1965 to 1980 now if anybody in this chamber or anybody in this country can live with that type increase and say nothing needs to be done i think they ought to rethink their position they do not know anything about the problem if they say nothing needs to be done but more needs to be done than is being done in the coalition package or in the jones package as i pointed out earlier

have gone out of sight and they have takea costs to others using hospitals with it hospital costs have been increasing at an annual rate of 14 2 percent since 1976 far outdistancing the consumer price index which rose by 9 8 percent during that period since 1967 hospital costs have increased more than 500 percent and medical care costs about 250 percent about noonday i spoke with the secretary of hhs do you have any idea how much hospital costs increased last year just last year nineteen percent a 19percent increase last year is there anything wrong with trying to get a handle on these skyrocketing costs i do not think so the people i talk with are complaining all the time about it by getting some kind of a handle on these costs we may reduce the costs to everyone the bipartisan resolution is a step toward getting these costs under control without let me emphasize thatwithout reducing benefits to the reciplents hospital cost containment initiatives assume no changes in the beneficiarys outofpocket costs but both the other alternative before us would permit excessive escalation of hospital costs to continue unabated since they only target 4 5 billion in savings over 3 years for new cost containment measures our resolution would also provide medicare savings in other areas of 9 8 billion not included in the jones or aspin budgets over 3 years how < k you get there

this body house resolution 208 a resolution to disapprove a specific action of the council of the district of columbia the district of columbia sexual assault act of 1981 district of columbia act 469 the question before us at this point is how do we now proceed in our consideration of this resolution my colleague the gentleman from illinois argues that the constitution gives us the responsibility to review any act passed by the council of the district of columbia to which we take objection that is embodied in the home rule act of 1973 we have the specific right to reserve unto ourselves the review of all laws enacted by the district of columbia government and under certain provisions our colleagues can bring a resolution of disapproval have it referred to the district of columbia committee and then based upon the committees action have it come before the full body of the house of representatives now the question is how do we as a body proceed it seems to me there are two directions in which we can go direction no 1 is to repeat the process by which the city council arrived at its action in 1974 the unitedstates congress brought to reality the law revision commission in 1977 the law revision commission made recommendations to the city council with respect to modernizing and reforminfg the criminal code in 1980 and 1981 the city council of the district of columbia held extensive hearings those hearings were the basis upon which the city council acted now i have here the list of the witnesses that were brought before the city council in hearings over a 2 year period in this first page without reading the names there are 15 witnesses listed on the secondpage 6 witnesses on the third page 12 witnessos on the fourth page 11 witnesses on the fifth page 14 witnesses on the final page 12 witnesses now if we are going to proceed with the first potential alternative and that is to repeat the action of the city council we would indeed in all good faith have to hold a series of hearings throughout this entire city in every neighborhoodl area and come up with a list of 50 or 60plus people who would have the opportunity to testify we could go through the act word by word line by line sentence by sentence and evaluate the law enacted by the city council but i would suggest that we are not a court of competent jurisdiction unless we are prepared to at least replicate and or go beyond what the city council did in arriving at its decision to enact district of columbia public i w 469 a bill to reform the crtmin~i code in the specific area of sexual assault but wve as a body chose in 1973 to not replicate the city counill we in our wisdom decided that there were too often competing interests in the district of columbia the federal interest and that is all of amfericas interest in the capital of the united states and the local interest the 600 000 or 700 000 human beings who live in washington d c who have the right to the franchise as any other citizen in the united states we in our wisdom decided that we did not want the district of columbia to be a colony of the united states in fact there are many organizations that perceive the district of columbia as the last colony of the united states and my colleagues in their collective wisdom suggested that we must do awvay with that give the district of columbia the franchise and we did and so it would seem to me that to attempt to replicate the business of the city council is an absurdity eight years ago we decided that we had more important things to do than to act as the city council of the district of columbia we had foreign policy calculations to absorb and consider we had defense policy calculations to absorb and consider we had enormous domestic issues affecting over 200 million americans that we should be engaging in and placing our intellectual spiritual moral and political energies into that business and we said let us free ourselves of the business of being the city council and we enacted in 1973 the home rule act thvg residents of the district of columbia duly elected a mayor and city council to do the business to express the will of the people in this district so they engaged in this process and as a result unanimously not majority unanimously enacted this law 13 to 0 so if we decide or if we are consistent with our efforts in home rule we must now strike this first proceeding and that is to replicate repeat engage in redundant activities with respect to what the district of columbia did in arriving at the enactment of this law what is the second mechanism the second mechanism is to think through what was the spirit and the intent of congress when it enacted the law in 1973 we said we chose not to be the city council we stepped back from that but my colleagues on this side of the aisle who support this resolution are correct my colleagues did write into the law an opportunity to review that is not the question here the question is what criteria shall wve use in the process of review that is consistent with the home rule act and is consistent with our desire for justice and our desire to embrace high ideals of democracy democratic principles and democratic procedures that then leads us to how the district of columbia committee arrived at the criteria it established in trying to determine whether we shall or shall not vote on a resolution of disapproval we decided that it was not within our jurisdiction in terms of the spirit of the home rule act or our competency to look at the specific legislation we came up with different criteria we said no 1 does the act of the city council violate the home rule act that seems to me quite reasonable and quite intelligent and one can arrive at an objective assessment of that question irrespective of political views ideological perspective or value orientation the question is did they violate the home rule act a reasonably intelligent human being can take the home rule act in one hand and the act or law of the city council in the other and arrive at some conclusion with respect to that no one here argues that they have exceeded their authority or indeed violated any section any line any sentence of the home rule act our second criteria was have the council violated the constitution of the united states no one here is competently asserting with a straight face that this act in any way challenges constitutional prerogatives or constitutional rights of any american citizen the third criteria does the act of the council in any way raise a federal issue or obstruct the federal interest and what is the federal interest does it obstruct the capacity of the unitedstates congress to represent 200plus million americans as it carries out its responsibility fhas the city council engaged in an act that thwarts our capacity to do this the answer to that is no so i am suggesting and members of this body it is a serious matter before us it is not frivolous i feel quite pained that we are here in a limited debate on a matter that strikes at the very fundamental processes of our way of life this is not a frivolous matter a few of my colleagues came in on this last rolleall angry because someone called a quorum call that would ask them to come down from the house dining room to this body and at least participate in the debate to disenfranchise 600 000 human beings and the response was what are you people doing you are making us angry we are going to vote against everything anid the point is we are prepared to harmn people but we do not want to do the work and be participants in the lynching if we are going to harm people at least integrity ought to dictate that we come here and do it in the full light of day and stop posturing politically for other purposes this is a serious matter here and i would suggest that we are not competent to repeat the business of the city council this is not an appropriate vehicle i chose not to engage in a dialog on the specific legislation because i think it is inappropriately before us however i do think given the law that we have a responsibility to review it in our wisdom as members of the district of columbia committee and as members of the house many of us have come to the conclusion that we have to have objective criteria to be used in our review that falls within the framework the spirit and intent if the home rule act now some of my colleagues are isaying this matter has achieved a level of significant controversy the moral majority is interested in this issue the reverend falwell is interested in this issue bishops aire interested in this issue but somewhere in the third or fourth grade i learned there is a separation of church and state here that is some way we ought to be engaging in dealing with matters that are our responsibility within the frame~~ork of democratic processes and irrespective of this controversy we ought to have the integrity to stay within the guidelines of procedures that can move us through this morass without imposing our personal religious views and without challenging a body and destroying the process simply because we disagree there are a number of the members on this side of the aisle with whom i have nothing in coimmon politically but i would stand with them and fight violently against any effort that would deny us the right to at least express our will everyone of these members has a city council that could enact this very same law but those same members cannot apply that to the government in washington d c their response is but this is the capitol and my response is in 1973 the congress understood and identified the duality of interests here and we attempted in our wisdom with an extra amount of compromises to make this dichotomy as clear as we could within that really conservative atmosphere that we enacted the home rule act in so this is an inappropriate matter to bring before the congress of the united states unless we are dealing with this within the spirit of the home rule act but many of our colleagues are saying but ron i just do not buy the specific provisions my progressive political posture would have dictated that i vote against the gambling ordinance in the district of columbia as i said earlier in the debate but i did not impose my personal will because i am more concerned about giving life to the democratic process that is all we have without that we are cannibals without a civilized set of processes we will cannibalize each other we are just an unruly mob of people who can willynilly move on anyone irrespective of their ideas and i am not sure that is what we are about here i would say to the maker of this motion if the gentlerran is serious then why does he not offer a sexual reform act for the entire nation and then let us engage in debate on that question that would at least be more honest than saying we can have home rule part of the time but when i do not agree with it or it is inconvenient we cannot have home rule people cannot live between freedom and servitude freedom is an absolute principle it seems to me that in this country where we are now saying this is the great bastion of democracy how can we in the capitol of the united states thwart peoliles rights because we are prepared to dance on the whims of political expediency and we all know there is enormous pressure a number of my colleagues do not even know what the issue is here but some kind of way they say rights are involved the moral majority is involved maybe i had better dance but my colleagues

funding for education above the house budget committee level and indeed it includes funding to restore programs to the present fiscal year 1982 reductions as passed in grammlatta let me now briefly outline the details of the congressional black caucus substitute before concluding my remarks you first ought to understand that the cbc budget reduces the deficit substantially in fact the congressional budget office has estimated that our budget will produce a 92 8 billion deficit in fiscal year 1983 which is lower by at least 10 billion than the deficit estimated by cbo for any other substitute and half the 183 billion deficit that will exist if nothing is done to rectify the errors of last years budget moreover our budget will lead to steadily shrinking deficits of 60 billion in fiscal year 1984 and a 18 billion surplus in fiscal year 1985 bringing interest rates down and providing the basis for genuine economic recovery in our country second you ought to know that the fauntroy substitute is fair and humane we not only prevent that many additional cuts in human needs programs as proposed by the president we return funds to social programs that were lost by the enactment of the reagan fiscal year 1982 budget reductions these programs must remain federal priorities if we value human potential and care to meet human needs because of savings generated by our alternative tax and defense policies several education health housing and urban programs can be restored to fiscal year 1981 funding levels adjusted for inflation for example the fauntroy substitute adds 3 3 billion to title i 600 million to pell grants for disadvantaged college students increasing funding for health care programs it adds 600 million in social services funding including child welfare programs and 1 billion more tlan reagan for pollution control it retains eda and the legal services corporation and lowincome energy and other conservation programs the third thing that this budget does is that it stimulates and creates jobs a centerpiece of our budget proposal is the creation of a major 6 billion to 8 billion federal jobs vocational education and training package this is a response to both the nations unemployment rate generally and to the catastrophic unempioyment in the black community specifically the fauntroy substitute also includes a 4 billion urban infrastructure proposal which will create 50 000 to 80 000 jobs directly and more indirectly a 4 billion expansion in mass transit and highway construction programs which will create an equal number of jobs in this country it also includes home ownership assistance and rental housing construction programs that will stimulate employment in residential construction finally the budget insures adequate social security and other support for the nations poor both the elderly and the nonelderly this budget maintains the costofliving adjustment for elderly on fixed incomes and expands unemployment compensation benefits at a time when we have 10 3 million people out of work the program triggers in the caucus budget increase eligibility for the unemployed to 52 weeks in our view this restoration of benefits is necessary at a time when we are experiencing the levels of unemployment which have not been endured since the depression our budget also provides increased funding for other programs to assist the poor including 3 2 billion more than reagan for aid to families with dependent children 5 billion more for food stamps 3 billion more for medicaid and medicare 1 2 billion more for six health programs and 400 million more for supplemental social insurance as my colleagues in the congressional black caucus follow me they will give you more details about the caucus budget resolution i simply want to remind you again that this is the peoples house and we ought to give the people the life support programs that will cushion them through these difficult times we need to give 96 percent of the people of this country the kird of tax relief that we have pr45mised in the generalized language about tax relief for all of the people we need to give the people relief from the enormous deficits and the high interest rates that have robbed the people of this country of homes and farms small businesses and 2 5 million jobs just since july of last year a vote for the fauntroy substitute the economic recovery program of the congressional black caucus will do just that at this time i would like to add the congressional budget offices reestimate of our budget proposal and yield time to my distinguished colleague from new york the third ranking member of the ways and means committee to share with you what our proposal does with respect to tax relief for the american people"], [0.00018727779388427734, 0.5001872777938843, 0, "there was a cigarette ad some years ago that promoted the slogan the thinking mans filter after one reviews this amendment as enticing as it looks on the surfaceafter the smoke clears awaywe can easily discern that it is not a thinking persons amendment why my real concern and i know yours too is jobs and a secure defense the t5 tanker program would mean 5 300 more years of american jobs over a 3year period the program would generate more than 152 million to the shipbuilding industry and support services this would in turn generate 3 million in state income tax and another 5 million in sales tax this along with our nations defense is a compelling argument for the t5 tanker notwithstanding the jobs concern there is the question of whether the navy should be saddled with equipment and technology which taxes their mission and is behind the curve of current technology the only american alternative to foreign engine on the t5 propulsion system would cost in excess of an additional 100 million and be well behind the current technological stateoftheart i ask you to remember the navy is leasing this ship and will not have to pay for the fuel and maintenance on these engines and i think it is the least we can do for them and our fellow taxpayers that we give them the powerplant that will do the most for the least money the sponsor of this amendment is trying to impose one policy on the navy when it has ships built for purchase and another on a civilian company when it builds a ship for navy charter the author of the amendment wants to tell a private shipbuilder who builds a ship for lease to the navy that when they build a ship it must be 100 percent domestically built but on the other hand if the navy were having it built for purchase we would be willing to settle for a mere 51percent domestic content totally illogical as the navy is not buying these vessels but leasing them it certainly has no interest in circumventing any buy america act provisions instead unlike the alleged buy america banner the sponsor of the amendment waves the proposed domestic content of the t5 tanker is 92 percentyes 92 percent the act cloaks himself in passed by this congress requires 51 percent that is why i allege this amendment is not a thinking persons amendment basicallyi want to save these 5 300 manyears of american jobs involved in the construction of the t5 tanker yes i am as much a proponent of buy american as the next person but enlightened opinion must dictate that we must bring

indeed the president himself has virtually abandoned the rationale he once offered for large tax cuts a bold supply side stimulus for savings and investment what not impends is a fat and floppy

housewives and students businessmen and teachers are joining together to call on the governments of the united states and the soviet union to negotiate a mutual freeze on the nuclear weapons race to be followed by real reductions these citizens are responding to the greatest moral imperative of our time the absolute necessity to avoid a nuclear war which would threaten the continued existence of our planet these thousands of citizens are helping millions more realize that in a nuclear war there can be no winners the hundreds of millions of people who would be killed instantly would be joined in death by those for whom there would be no hospitals or doctors and those whose water and food supply was contaminated and made radioactive citizens in my home city of boulder colo realized this

institution for the fostering of international understanding peace and harmony through a healthy exchange of parliamentarians and parliamentary practices and procedures he further stated i am fully convinced that this exchange and crossfertilization of ideas has helped a great deal in promoting wider international understanding and cooperation not only among lawmakers but also among the dif ferent states represented in the union the interparliamentary union has fostered international peace unity and harmony through constant dialogue i would ask to include the full text of president shagaris speech at the close of my remarks i was assigned to the committee on nonselfgoverning ter ritories and ethnic questions and i am also submitting for the benefit of the house the draft resolutions which came out of that committee and which will be voted on in rome in september of this year the central issue of concern in the ipu committee on nonselfgoverning territories as well as elsewhere in discussions amongst the african and other third world delegates was south africas continued occupation of namibia it may be difficult for many americans to understand the immediacy and depth of feeling attached to this issue indeed in the past 18 months we have been encouraged by officials within our government to redefine the situation in southern africa and to view it from within the definitions of ideological and geopolitical conflicts that trou ble western europe in doing so the united states has taken a giant step backward into the 19th century this is a naive and dangerous view not one on which strong and lasting unitedstates relations with the countries of africa and the third world can be based it is a view in which even our staunchest nato allies part company it is a view attractive to people who have completed political science sequences within universities which stress only the history of 19th century political conflicts between european nations however it is a view which has nothing to do with the realities of contemporary africa and with the determination of nonwhite populations to shake off the yokes of colonialism and apartheid anyone who fails to see that this struggle against apartheid and its extension to namibia will remain the primary determinant of african sentiments toward america and europe is dangerously insensitive and out of touch in this regard it is clear that current unitedstates policy toward southern africa represents at best a highrisk strategy which shows no signs of working at worst a dangerous drift toward permanently redefining unitedstates commitments to human rights and lacial justice the implications for our own society are extremely troubling the negative impact that this apparent attempt to reverse unitedstates policy is having on our relationships with the nations of africa and the third world was starkly evident in lagos i do not wish to make a partisan speech but it is recognized that outside of africa unitedstates diplomatic interests and long range strategic objectives are extremely frayed within africa unitedstates interests are held hostage by and are completely at the mercy of the south african government at any moment some event within south africa or namibia or even some event external to the region may crystallize world sentiment against the united states i submit that this is a result of the radical policy reversal that has taken place within the past 18 months it is not a solution in which the congress can afford to acquiesce the reagan administrations southern africa policy is based on two conflicting views the first is that south africa is a bulwark against soviet expansion and as such must be supported by the united states no matter how repugnant its internal policies the second view is that the africaners are a prickly people who must be humored by the united states if they are to be encouraged to make changes essential to their own survival the truth of the matter is that south africa has no intention of making changes within south africa nor of seeing an independent government come to power in namibia so long as it can avoid it unless it is forced to by events which remain unforeseen the south african position with respect to the united states is simple as previously articulated by south african officials in meetings with our own government some time ago south africa feels that through internal repression and the forced relocation of black and nonwhite populations it can contain any developments which might occur among its black and nonwhite populations provided the united states will guarantee protection from any outside force including south african freedom fighters who are foreigntrained or fighting with foreign advisers like a hapless giant the united states has apparently acquiesced the result is ai increasingly dangerous isolation of our government in africa and among the nations of the third world in addition those major nations such as nigeria which risked their own international standing in order to counsel patience in this and other conflicts now feel increasingly that they have been toyed with by the united states in short we are at a pivotal point the positive regard with which our efforts in southern africa were viewed has been dissipated a policy which is not seen as bungling is increasingly viewed as duplicitous my question is is it worth it for the united states and is this dangerous drift in unitedstates relations something to be acquiesced in by the congress i believe most of my colleagues are unaware of how radical the unitedstates policy drift has been the documented information i cite has been developed by the house committee on foreign affairs and puts into sharp focus criticisms that were made by the ipu delegates it is time we took a hard look at the unitedstates policy shift in the 18 months that it has been in office the reagan administration has initiated a number of changes in american policy toward south africa following are some of the changes which have been undertaken in march 1981 the administration granted visas to three senior south african military intelligence officers including general vander westhizen chief of military intelligence and the former south african military attach6 who had been asked to leave the united states following the expulsion of the unitedstates military attach6 in south africa even though there was a policy of not permitting senior military army and intelligence officers to come to the united states visas were issued to these three officials supposedly by error they subsequently met with unitedstates ambassador to the u n jeanne kirkpatrick and officials at the national security council and the defense department the united states upgraded its milltary attache office at the american embassy in pretoria and allowed the south africans to do the same in washington in november 1981 and march 1982 two south african generals visited the united states as part of a namibia negotiating team in october 1981 two police officers attended international conferences in the united states the presence of these officials casts doubt on the departments earlier statement that the admission of three south african generals was in error the united states permitted the south african government to establish as many as five new honorary consulates in the united states in pittsburgh seattle phoenix cleveland and denver the city of pittsburgh has strongly protested the administration changed the foreign policy export controls in june 1981 to permit the sale of medical equipment to the south african military and to permit the sale of crime control devices to the south african government it should be noted that shortly after the completion of this sale a group of south africans were able to smuggle arms out of south african over land in an aborted attempt to overthrow the government of the sychelles the administration further amended the foreign policy export controls in february 1982 to permit the sale of items to the south african police military and security forces previously the carter administration had refused american companies permission to sell any items to the south african police military or security forces the new administration policy makes it easier for american companies to sell computers to those agencies and ministries in south africa responsible for enforcing apartheid the departments of state and commerce have agreed to gralit two american companiesbeechcraft and piperlicenses to export up to 22 air ambulances to the south afncan air force these will probably be used to ferry wounded troops from namibia to south africa the south african government wants to purchase at least six of these planes which can also be configured as troop carriers and intelligencegathering planes in 1981 the united states permitted approximately 20 south african nuclear technicians to come to this country to receive training at unitedstates government facilities the administration approved the travel of several american technicians from the department of energy to travel to south africa to investigate that countrys coal to gas conversion process previously such cooperation between unitedstates government agencies and south african government agencies had been denied in march 1982 the administration granted an export license to an american companycontrol datato sell a cyber 170 750 computer to south africas governmentcontrolled center for industrial and scientific research csir the cyber 750 is one of the most advanced computers made in the united states and can be used for advanced nuclear research to model nuclear explosions and for breaking

standards and national science foundation two unitedstates companiesedlow international and swucoacted as brokers in the sale of highly enriched uranium fuel for south africas koeburg nuclear reactors in order to circumvent unitedstates nonproliferation laws the department of state may have been aware of this transaction arguing that public statements are counterproductive the administration has backed away from the basic human rights principles of the carter administration and has ceased to make any public statements about south africas ongoing human rights violations the administration vetoed a u n resolution condemning south africas invasion of angola last fall and did not protest south africas earlier attack on the african national congress in mozambique the administration has not criticized south africas support or rebels attempting to overthrow the governrients of angola and mozambique more subtly the administrations fiscal year 1982 aid request recommended elimination of the unitedstates contribution to the u n trust fund for south africa the money from this fund was used to pay lawyers in south africa to defend black and white south africans arrested for political offenses or for violating south africas aparthied laws the administration also asked for reductions in unitedstates contributions to the u n trust fund for namibia which is used to help train and educate namibian refugees the administration refused to go along with a joint french british and german initiative to condemn the south africans for forcibly relocating thousands of blacks from the cape town area in the dead of winter to their socalled homelands 800 miles away in the transkei it refused to protest the unexplained death in detention of dr neil agaitt a white doctor who was arrested for his work advising black trade unionists the administration has not publicly condemned the impending execution of three black south africans for political offenses in addition to risking unitedstates relations with other nations and to committing the united states to a policy which is repugnant to our own institutions and to the overwhelming majority of the american people there is already ample evidence that the administrations new approach has not worked in fact it may have encouraged the south african government to take even harsher measures against both blacks and whites who oppose its apartheid policies there are indications that the administrations policies may be enco raging the repression of moderate elements within south africa and increasing the commitment of the people of south africa and of namibia to change at any price in the past 18 months the south african government has made no meaningful reforms instead its actions have been in the direction of greater repression in 1981 the south african government arrested and detained for political reasons over 300 black trade union members many of them leaders of some of south africas most moderate trade unions these arrests and detentions without trial continue dr neil aggit a white labor union official mysteriously died while in detention and at least two other black officials had to be taken to mental institutions following intensive questioning the south african government has banned two black newspapersthe post and the sunday post the gov ernment had previously banned the world and the weekend world the post was the largest circulation daily in south africa and the countrys principal black newspaper the government has refused to allow bishop desmond tutu to travel outside of south africa by revoking his passport bishop tutu is an opponent of apartheid he is the head of the anglican church in south africa and secretarygeneral of the south african council of churches bishop tutu was to be the keynote speaker at the allard lowenstein memorial lecture series at yale and to receive an honorary doctorate at columbia the government has forcibly removed thousands of blacks in cape town and
