from mississippi has put into this bill let me start my remarks by pointing out as the gentleman from virginia pointed out before me that only about half of this bill concerns itself with agriculture there is no doubt that that most productive element of our economy needs to have some support from this level of government and i would hope that the people who are focusing on this particular piece of legislation will focus on the fact that it is really in two parts one devoted to agriculture that we have heard a lot about today but the other part devoted to welfare the food stamp program and others like it i make that mention because when we get to the welfare area there have been some very inventive things done in this particular bill we have heard a lot of talk today about the fact that this bill comes in under budget that we have met the budget targets that we have done all these things well in fact we have except we just have not funded the programs for the full year i mean it is a little like the family that finds itself with 15 000 of income and 20 000 of expenses what they say is well ok fine we have only 15 000 worth of income so we will only pay our bills for threequarters of the year we will only pay them through september and we will let the other 3 months go and we have thereby balanced our budget that is exactly what we are doing in this particular bill we are saying fine we cannot fund the programs adequately for the full year so we will only do them for part of the year and then come in later on for a supplemental appropriation and expand the spending there by how much the congressional budget office estimates that for the programs that we have not funded for the full year that it is going to cost us about an extra billion dollars added on that does not put us under budget that puts us over budget in my opinion all of a sudden more than 50 percent of the money in this bill is going for welfare costs rather than for agriculture so i am concerned about the fact that we have this very inventive kind of budget philosophy embodied to this bill as i say we did not do that over in the agriculture area those programs are funded through september 30 it is primarily in the food stamp where this is affected what that means is that 9 5 billion that the administration requested in going to be covered in this bill yes but only for the first several months of the year and then afterward we are going to have to find more money to the tune of how much maybe 1 billion maybe 1 2 billion i think that this bill gives us good reason to question exactly the kind of appropriations process that we are engaging in in this house it is the reason why earlier today for instance i raised the question about the continuing resolution and some of the rest we find ourselves in a cituation where we are being told that we are coming in under budget that we are complying with the budget only to find in the details of the bill that in fact we have found a way to get around the budget commitments so when the appropriate moment comes in the case of the food stamp program i am going to offer a very simple amendment to take the funding in this bill that matches the presidents request and instead of cutting it off on july 15 of next year we go clear through to september 30 with that amount of money then we would really be within the budget an extremely appropriate amendment and i hope that it would be passed"], [0.41881123185157776, 0.41881123185157776, 0, "i wish i could say in closing the debate on our side that this debate this afternoon and this morning has been constructive but i cannot this is a very very important issue as has been pointed out by the gentleman fr9m minnesota and the gentleman from alabama it is a question of whether or not we turn the country around economically or whether we do not why do i say the debate has not been constructive first it started off on the wrong foot because we had a situation occur with the printing of our bill that just should not have occurred and everyone in this house knows about it now so i do not want to repeat it but i hope as long as i serve in this body we will never have that happen again that no one no one will go up to the bill room and get a bill before it goes to the printer and tear it apart and put it back in such a way that we have had in this bill and the delayed printing of a proper bill so that they would have a photocopy i have talked to my good friend from texas and certainly he will speak to that issue that is not going to happen again in this house that should not have happened this time but it did and you cannot blame us for not having a printed bill when that printed bill could not have been given to us because of that delay caused by a couple of individuals on that side so let us not have that happen again let me say it has not been constructive from this point do my colleagues realize that the committee bill the committee bill which i have in my hands 497 pages which comes from all of the committees of this house has not even been really debated and our democrat friends are ready to vote on it i thought perhaps we would hear from the democratic committee chairmen this afternoon as we did on our side title by title and tell the members of this house what is in your package what is in your package you are saying that you do not know what is in our package you do not know what is in your package it has not been explained it has not been explained to the american people i think that your argument falls on deaf ears when the real truth of the matter comes out you do not know what is in your own package for example military retirees you take credit in your figures for taking cola away from military retirees on the provision that they do likewise for the civilians let me also say they take credit for a food stamp cap and we just voted on tuesday to remove a food stamp cap and they take credit for a savings in that how ridiculous sure we are below the first year in what the gentlemans committee put together as the jones package and all they did was assemble what came from the individual committees tied a string around it and sent it in but they had it printed in proper form we did not intervene and attempt to get a copy of it and to mess it up on the way to the printer we did not do that and we never will mark my word let me also say that this is a critical issue the president of the united states is interested in it we had on our side our ranking members our leadership on the committees went down title by title and explained what was in our bill we had no explanation as to what is in this democrat package put out by the full committee and it is more comprehensive goes into greater detail and i will bet half of the membership has not even looked at the panetta himself says the cuts are in your bill in that committee package and you are ready to vote on it i say that we need a little more light on what the committee has done to america in this package and we have not gotten any light on this from the majority side my budget colleagues did not hold any hearings on it and they do not know what is in it and they said in the budget committee all we do is put it in a bundle tie a string around it and send it to the rules committee"],

to washington from my district out in idaho i had a unique experience over the weekend that i think reflects so well the very things the gentleman has been saying in the last several minutes as to how the american public perceives and understands what a tax cut is what a budget out of control is i would say to the gentleman from georgia i stood in a jc breakfast line for 2 hours on saturday morning and turned pancakes and listened to over 1 200 people as they came by me to offer comments about what is going on in washington they would say have you got the budget under control yet and are you really going to do what you said you were going to do in 1980 and that is cut that budget and get those taxes down so that we can get back to work one gentleman came along and he said i havent heard much about that democratic alternative budget yet but he said i read just a few comments about it in the paper the other morning he said you know there is not much out on it yet and apparently they are trying to rush something through he said from what i have read they are going to increase taxes again arent they and i said yes that is their plan to increase them some 140plus billions of dollars in the next 3 years he said well what is that going to do to me and my family am i going to have to pay more taxes and i said yes that is exactly what you are going to have to do they are going to force you to pay more taxes they are going to take more of your money away from you he said well cant you cut the budget isnt that the way you get interest rates down is to stop that kind of spending and that kind of demand on the money supply of this country and i said well that is what we have tried to do because we knew that is what you wanted as a working person as a small businessman and as a farmer and a rancher and as a bluecollar worker that you wanted more of your own money and you wanted to have the government take less of it away so i thank you today for taking this special order to clarify some of the points that are pretty hazy out there at this moment hazy only because they have not been spelled out the way you are spelling them out the american public understands very clearly what is going on at this moment they know what they asked for in 1980 and it has not been delivered to them we have only gotten a taste of it in the last 15 months and now the opposition is reaching out to grasp back and take away the very kinds of things they asked for because that is exactly what that budget alternative talks about is increased taxes increased spending that is the kind of business as usual that created those high interest rates and that high inflation and it is awfully important and the gentleman takes on a very important responsibility in spelling it out as clearly as he does that we are really back to business as usual when we get back to business as usual it really means no business at all when we have no business at all we have no jobs and then we will not have the kind of unemployment rates which we inherited from the spending of the 1960s and the 1970s but we will have much higher so i again congratulate the gentleman on taking this special order"],

stress the cooperation in view of the fact of what we have pending in the spirit of cooperation i believe that we can pass a budget resolution that the country so badly needs i know there is going to be a lot of partisanship exhbited during the next several hours and maybe during the next couple of days but this is good it will point up the differences between the parties as well as the resolutions and we ought to point up those differences but certainly we have to keep in the back of our minds that we have to pass a resolution we have to pass a resolution with which we can go to conference we have to pass something that we can be proud of and something that will do the job that is needed to be done for the country i think most people in this chamber will agree that the biggest job we have before us is the matter of bringing down interest rates i heard some of the statements made earlier today about the chairman of the federal reserve mr volcker he cannot do it all himself the big problem is right here in this congress are we going to continue spending and spending and borrowing and borrowing and taxing and taxing this is a question we have to decide if we want to continue on the way of the past we are not going to bring interest rates down no way the package that i have presented here is a bipartisan package hammered out through several long hours and everything is not to my liking in that package if i had written the substitute all by myself it would be written differently in a good many areas but this is a consensus that we have arrived at we have heard a lot about cutting cutting there has been many stories printed in the newspaper and there has been a lot of talk over television that we are cutting the budget you know and i know we are not cutting spending from fiscal year 1982 even the budget the bipartisan budget substitute now before the house is 39 6 billion more more not less more than fiscal year 1982 we are not cutting from fiscal year 1982 we are adding to that spending it is a question of how much do you add how much can you add and still bring down those interest rates certainly i was pleased as was everyone looking at the financial page today to see that the interest rates have dropped a little bit just within the last day they have got to drop a lot more but i was pleased to see that treasury bills fell to 11 48 on 26year bills this is a good beginning it is good to know that several major banks cut their broker loan rate to 14 75 from 15 50 a move that could foreshadow a decline in the prime rate from 16 50 but certainly what is starting now is not going to continue if we say here in this house today tomorrow or the next day that we cannot reduce spending and borrowing we cannot resist that temptation to say yes yes yes to every request being made we are not going to bring down those interest rates on the contrary they will probably start back up i know my colleagues are going to go back home and say we are doing everything we can to reduce interest rates because it is hurting everybody certainly what we do here on this floor will have some influence i am confident of that but if we merely do a little tinkering here and a little tinkering there we are not going to accomplish much so we have to show the country and those people who are deeply involved with these interest rates that we mean business about reining in deficit financing the recovery package we have introduced on a bipartisan basis will have the best chance of bringing down interest rates it is 76 billion deficit reduction package which slows the growth of spending by 56 billion in fiscal year 1983 and adds 20 billion in revenues certainly it is a resolution which if adopted will slow the seemingly unquenchable appetite for government spending and will lead the country back to economic recovery i need not tell the members of this house that this package has the backing of the president of the united states as he expressed last night and has support on both sides of the aisle it is truly a bipartisan package this package spends less money overall than the other 2 plans that we will be considering later on it provides more money for the buildup of our national defenses which we started last year it also raises fewer taxes than either of the other two it protects the fundings for critical programs for the poor the elderly and the unemployed yes and it does provide a reconciliation date the others do not this bipartisan recovery budget calls for a minimum revenue increase over the next 3 years of 95 billion by contrast both of the other alternatives increase taxes by greater amounts during the next 3 years the jones or the committee version calls for 147 billion in tax increases while the socalled coalition or aspin package would increase taxes by 135 billion thato 135 billion tax increase in the coalition budget could cancel the 33 percent of the 3year tax reduction voted by the congress last year the bipartisan package would protect those individual income tax reductions made last year and which will be further reduced on july 1 this year by 10 percent and july 1 next year by another 10 percent when you add the social security tax increases scheduled for the next 3 yearsand the taxes called for in the aspin and jones budgetsit adds up to a 247 billion total increase in taxes for the american working person almost a quarter of a trillion dollar increase both the jones and the aspin budgets would mean either the elimination or deferral of the 10 percent individual income tax cut in july of 1983 they would also require reductions in the business tax incentives for investments productivity and jobs supporters of the coalition and jones budget will tell you their resolutions do not require doing anything with the individual mcome tax and business tax cuts they probably will say that specific revenue increases will be made by the ways and means committee true true but there is no way to raise the kind of money they are talking about without taking the measures i have just outlined why are their tax increases so high well because their spending is high because they insist on spending more and more money they must raise taxes if the coalition resolution revenue increases were cut back to the 95 billion level that is in our resolution it would mean a 40 billion increase in their deficit over 3 years so to reduce the deficit we will need to slow the growth of government spending the bipartisan recovery budget does that in a fair and a balanced way now let me point out at this juncture that we deal in aggregatesaggregatesin the budget committee we do not mandate anything other than those aggregates until we get to reconciliation and then we tell the committees how much money they have to raise or reduce their spending but we are merely showing the way as to how you can get to where we have to go let me say we freeze all nondefense discretionary spending programs at the 1982 level and then add back money for programs we believe additional spending is warranted and slow spending for programs we believe are growing too rapidly and not needed for example the bipartisan budget provides 139 million moremorefor compensatory education for disadvantaged children than does the jones budget we add 50 million more than the jones budget for handicapped education and 78 million more for education block grants we increase energy conservation spending by 166 million we spend 45 million more than the jones budget on vocational education we spend 217 million more on elementary and secondary education we spend 107 million more on ceta it provides 13 million or 59 percent more than jones for the energy regulatory activities it adds 23 million or 55 percent to jones for energy research it exceeds the presidents january request by 6 1 billion for medicaid 6 1 billion for medicald than was in the presidents request it provides for 3 7 billion or 68 percent more than the president requested for public assistance it adds 2 7 billion more than the president requested for guaranteed student loans now there have been a lot of stories being spread around this capitol buildingand that this is not unusualthat the bipartisan recovery budget cuts the funds appropriated in the 1982 emergency housing supplemental we heard a little about this earlier this simply is not true in fiscal years 1983 1984 and 1985 we have just as much for this program as do the other alternatives in the allowance function the letter from alice rivlin has been read but let me just point out that there was an error certainly by alice rivlin when we submitted that amount of money and she came back with a letter admitting her mistake furthermore our budget provides for 1 billion ginne mae tandem mortgages just as is contained in the house budget committee proposal this amount of money is contained in our housing function contrary to the erroneous reports being circulated also in the housing area authority our proposal contains exactly the same for farmers home administration as does the house budget committee proposal in our case funds are recorded differently because it assumes certificates of benefit ownership are to be sold to the federal financing bank which issues these loans in its own name once again erroneous information was issued which must be corrected we have received a letter from the cbo which admits an error was made in removing the 1 billion out of the resolution and this letter from alice rivlin has already been read so i am not going to take the time of the house to reread t we have however asked for and expect to receive a similar letter from cbo regarding the 1982 supplemental request under the entitlements entitlements are the fastest growing segment of the federal budget in this important area the bipartisan recovery budget achieves savings of approximately 34 billion more than twice the savings contained in the coalition package which calls for entitlement reform of only 16 billion the coalitions 16 billion in entitlements savings amounts to only 1 4 percent of the current law entitlement spending of 1 2 trillion the bipartisan resolution contains only 6 9 billion in entitlement savings in the first year certainly as you look at the amount involved we ought to have more savings than the resolution now before us contains 1 it contains more savings than either the other two propositions these savings are accomplished while still allowing full costofliving increases for social security railroad retirement benefits veterans pensions and compensation our proposal calls for cost of living increases to be capped at 4 percent for fiscal year 1983 and 1984 1985 i understand an amendment will be offered by the gentleman from virginia to give these federal employees and federal retirees the same cost of living as the individuals on social security railroad retirement benefits and others but our provision as far as capping these individuals i have mentioned the federal retirees and the federal employees is the same as the budget committee entitlement savings are critical and if we fall to slow their rapid increase and we are not doing much in any of these packages including the one now before us we are not going to be able to control government spending in the manner in which we should in the well of the house is one example of the tremendous growth in our entitlement programs this is hhs programs from 1950 to 1984 in 1950 we start up with only 12 5 billion we get to 1970 my colleagues can see that it is above 35 billion then it starts almost right straight up now we are up to 108 1 billion in 4 years a tremendous increase in this one department alone the bipartisan budget assumes some medicare savings here is someplace where a lot of misinformation has been put out by you know who in this chamber because every time you talk of any kind of savings they always try to bring in that the elderly people are going to get hurt nothing nothing in these savings is going to touch the recipient in any substantial way at all but savings we must have and the committee recognized that as does the coalition budget recognize some savings must be made in medicare medicare savings in our proposal over 3 years 3 years will be 23 2 billion compared to the coalition budget medicare savings of 9 4 billion without any reform at all in this one particular program medicare costs will total over 200 billion for the next 3 years to give the members some idea of the magnitude of this increase that is nearly as much as the entire cost of this program during its first 15 years of existence up to 1980 let me repeat that this 200 billion for this one program for the next 3 years 200 billion is nearly as much as the entire cost of the program durinf its first 15 years of existence from 1965 to 1980 now if anybody in this chamber or anybody in this country can live with that type increase and say nothing needs to be done i think they ought to rethink their position they do not know anything about the problem if they say nothing needs to be done but more needs to be done than is being done in the coalition package or in the jones package as i pointed out earlier they would only do something about 9 4 billion what do we propose the administration has proposed hospitalcost containment hospital costs have been increasingthis is what we are talking about the provider not the recipient as some have spread out across this country erroneously and i think it is unfair to the person paying his own billwe are talking about the taxpayers now i got a letter in my office this morning from a taxpayerhe is not on medicaretelling me how much his insurance costs his family he said i cannot afford it i cannot afford the cost for the insurance these medicare costs have gone out of sight and they have takea costs to others using hospitals with it hospital costs have been increasing at an annual rate of 14 2 percent since 1976 far outdistancing the consumer price index which rose by 9 8 percent during that period since 1967 hospital costs have increased more than 500 percent and medical care costs about 250 percent about noonday i spoke with the secretary of hhs do you have any idea how much hospital costs increased last year just last year nineteen percent a 19percent increase last year is there anything wrong with trying to get a handle on these skyrocketing costs i do not think so the people i talk with are complaining all the time about it by getting some kind of a handle on these costs we may reduce the costs to everyone the bipartisan resolution is a step toward getting these costs under control without let me emphasize thatwithout reducing benefits to the reciplents hospital cost containment initiatives assume no changes in the beneficiarys outofpocket costs but both the other alternative before us would permit excessive escalation of hospital costs to continue unabated since they only target 4 5 billion in savings over 3 years for new cost containment measures our resolution would also provide medicare savings in other areas of 9 8 billion not included in the jones or aspin budgets over 3 years how < k you get there let me mention just a few for starters by putting a cap on physicians fees in 1983 and allowing a 5 percent increase in 1984 we talk about capping everything else is it not fair to consider a cap here reducing reimbursements for radiologists and pathologists to the level applicable to all other physicians"], [0.4493688642978668, 0.4493688642978668, 0, "this will be the week a few days after the deadline which had been set for the budget to be reported that we finally will in fact begin to see the budget and to debate the budget for fiscal year the house is actually not doing too badly to be taking up the budget only a week after the official deadline and yet it is somehow ironic that for millions of americans whose deadline for employment for keeping their business for keeping their job has passed that this body does seem to be unable to work on time and when it does finally work it works with a haste which makes it difficult to decide precisely what is happening the chairman of the budget committee and the liberal democrats who run the congress or run the house have finally come up with a budget which they are getting printed this week which they will take to the rules committee this week which they will begin to debate this week moving with sudden haste after a long period of waiting talking and doing little one of the reasons for the haste is because the longer we have to look at their budget and the longer we have to analyze their proposals the less likely it is that that budget will be passed put simply the united states is at a crossroads we face a choice between continuing to decay as we have in the seventies continuing to lose industry and jobs overseas continuing to be in a situation in which american workers have obsolete factories and obsolete equipment and are literally unable to compete or changing to a new way of doing business in 1980 the american people were faced with that choice and voted for a new way of doing business they voted to cut government spending to cut taxes to change the way in which the country had been decaying in a very real sense we have lost a decade in our national history the peak of real take home pay for working americans was 1965 the peak of our military power compared to the russians was 1968 the peak of our technological advantage at least symbolically was 1969 when americans landed on the moon for the decade of the seventies we spend more than we earned we made up the difference with inflation we devalued our dollar so each year if you saved money you had lost but if you borrowed money you had all sorts of advantages and for 10 years american businesses built fewer factories bought fewer machines and we grew weaker and weaker for the same 10 years the share of our federal government that was taken up by the defense establishment grew smaller and smaller while the shire of our federal government taken up by transfer payments grew bigger and bigger many people have heard these transfer payments referred to as entitlements but i think that is fundamentally misleading in fact the transfer payment is taking money from one american to give it to another american and it has been the rise of transfer payments more than any other single thing which has led to the dramatic increase in american government let me give you an example of the size of change we have been dealing with in 1967 all transfer payments for individuals amounted to 42 billion by 1982 15 years later that had grown to 329 billion think of it almost a 1 000percent increase from 42 to 329 billion during the same period outlays for national defense in terms of contracts and obligations that is the things we buy to protect ourselves went up only from 20 to 55 billion for all the talk about the size of our national defense system the fact is that national defense takes a smaller share of our federal budget than at any time in the last 25 years in fact we have reversed positions whereds national defense when president kennedy took office was about 49 percent of the budget national defense today has dropped dramatically the exact figures are that in 1960 49 percent of the federal budget went for defense and 27 7 percent went to transfer payments by 1980 only 23 6 percent of the budget went for defense while 52 1 percent went for a variety of transfer payments in other forms of subsidy think of the differenceliterally reversing roles now we have seen in the falkland islands that it is very dangerous to be weak we have seen in poland in afghanistan in el salvador and in lebanon that it is very dangerous to invite war the question is how much does it take to be strong and how much do we need in our defense system to insure that americans can live in peace the liberal democratic budget which has been proposed by the budget committee will force tremendous changes in the defense department it will cut defense spending back to a level of president carter in effect we have been warned it would require the deactivation of at least one and maybe two army divisions it would require that we cut out at least one marine brigade that we take out of commission at least 36 navy ships that we take out of action two active and two reserve fighter wings that we might have to retire all the remaining b52d squadrons and you can go down with a list of item after item after item what would that mean it would mean a weaker america it would mean greater danger of war it would mean that other countries could look at us and decide maybe to challenge us maybe to take risks because they might think we would be too weak to do anything now in 1980 the american people voted for a stronger defense not a weaker defense and yet the liberal democratic budget clearly calls for cuts in defense spending on a scale which will return us to weakness second in 1980 the american people voted for a smaller federal government they said it is better to spend money in texas or to spend money in nebraska than to spend money in washington it is better to have strong local and state government to have money in your own pocket to have money for your church and neighborhood association yet in fact the liberal democractic budget will continue the same basic pattern of bigger federal government bigger spending more outlays it will lead to in the long run even more money being spend in washington even more things being done by the federal government now for a long time politicians thought they could send more and more to washington because they automatically were going to get more and more what is happening is that inflation was pushing workers into higher and higher tax brackets so that each year more and more americans automatically lost more money to the federal government congressman bob michel the republican leader commented recently that in his entire career here in over 20 years in washington he had never voted for a permanent tax increase but the way the tax system is structured it just automatically went up every year a little higher and a little higher now we have tried to change that we have begun to put the federal government on a diet but the problem is that the liberal democratic budget does not want us to be on a diet it does not want to shrink the cize of the federal government far from it it wants to see that government continue to increase to get larger and larger every year now this increase has not been modest to take just the programs that are relatively uncontrollable under present law that is where we have to change the law to bring them under control those programs totaled 92 billion in 1967 by 1982 they had grown to 544 billion a tremendous increase if they are allowed to continue down the road they will grow bigger and bigger and bigger and what does that mean it means more money in washington and less and less money back home there are only two ways to spend that much money either to raise taxes on the american people directly or to have inflation to raise taxes indirectly but in 1980 the american people voted against that and in 1980 the american people said no let us cut the size of government and let us cut taxes now what does that mean if we cut the size of government we can in fact cut taxes and we can nonetheless stop inflation but if we only cut taxes and allow government to grow bigger and bigger we have no choice except to go back and have more inflation and or have more taxation the liberal democratic budget will yield both it will create more inflation and it will raise taxes in fact over the next 3 years the liberal democratic budget would raise taxes by 145 billion now that is a lot of money and it is hard to figure out what a billion dollars means so let me translate it back into human terms into what real people spend hopefully in the next few years as employment picks back up as the re cession ends we will return to about 100millionworking americans that is an easy number to work with a total of 145 billion in tax increases means that every working american would pay 1 450 in additional money in taxes that means if you and your wife both work and you are typical americans you would pay over the next 3 years an additional 2 900 in taxes now i will let each family decide what they would spend 2 900 on but the bottom line of the liberal democratic budget is very simple it means more government spending in washington less of it on defense so we are weaker in foreign policy we have a weaker defense system we are less able to protect ourselves at the same time it means more taxes by 145 billion or 1 450 for every working americr3 2 900 for every working couple that means a car that will not be bought a room that will not be added to the house furniture that will not be bought vacations that will not he taken college classes that cannot be attended it means less money for working americans i h4 2259 well let me carry it a step further we got sicker and we lost ground we lost a decade in the 1970s in part because of policies that were just sheer nonsense because liberal democrats believed you could raise taxes over and over and you would not kill industries but you could ralso taxes and raise inflation and you would not weaken the country we see the same thing in their current plan for example they suggest that they will save 55 billion as interest rates come down with their budget that happens to be the exact amount that would be saved under president reagans recent budget proposals to the senate 55 billion because as interest rates come down the government which is the largest borrower of all would be spending less to pay interest now no one believes that a budget which is going to raise taxes by 145 billion is going to dramatically bring down interest rates and let me explain why interest rates are staying high because the federal government is borrowing a great deal and belause americans have not saved enough to bring down interest rates it is not just a simple equation of how much are we borrowing but it is also a question of how much are we saving in both germany and japan governments have run bigger deficits than we are running with lower interest rates because in both germany and japan the people save a great deal more money the fact is that at the present time americans have not been saving enough why because the laws have been biased against savings we said that if you save we will tax your interest but if you borrow we will let you take a tax deduction furthermore by raising taxes we do not leave you with enough money to save now let us take a simple step here a typical american family in my hometown of carrollton ga sits down and says lets open an individual retirement account lets put some money away we have now changed the laws in congress to make it worthwhile to save in an individual retirement account they say i know why dont we save 1 450 over the next 3 years that will go into that individual retirment account that will go into the savings pool of the nation that will be used to cover the federal debt and interest rates will come down that is in fact how germany and japan cover their deficits without high interest rates but now what has happened now the liberal democrats have come along and said ah you are not going to be able to save that 1 450 because we ar going to take it out oi your pocket in the form of h her loxes every businessman and tconomist is familiar with the idea of crowding out crowding out means that when the federal government borrows in washington or in new york it borrows money that would otherwise have been borrowed by somebody who wanted to buy a house or a car or a small business it crowds out those other transactions but equally you can crowd out through higher taxes because if you cannot get the money in your pocket because the government took it out before it got home you cannot save if you cannot save the money is not there to be borrowed if the money is not there to be borrowed you are going to have increased interest rates so it is laughable to have the liberal democratic budget suggest the same interest rate level as the more conservative budget because clearly the more conservative budget by not raising taxes 1 450 per working american is r t going to have the same level of interest rates and when you borrow as much as the federal government does every percentage point matters it is important to remember that the federal deficit has gotten so big so big that in fact we spend more on interest alone than the army and the marine corps combined cost the american taxpayer let me repeat that because it is so unbelievable we pay more in interest than we pay for the army and the marine corps combined because our debt is now that big and our interest rates are now that high the question really in the next 2 weeks in the congress is which way do we want to go in effect the liberal democrats and the budget committee are carrying us back to president carters budgets to 1979 and 1980 they are saying lets cure the economy by raising taxes lets cure unemployment by taking more money away from the american people lets cure interest rates by having even less savings even less investments this will prove to be a budget of unemployment a budget of bankruptcy a budget of high interest rates and a budget of high inflation in fact the last time we attempted to raise taxes in the middle of recession was in 1932 in 1932 the hoover administration and congress agreed to raise taxes by about 30 percent but receipts actually fell the more they raised taxes the fewer people there were to work to pay them let me give you a few other examples when we tried that in 1916 to 1920 we raised taxes the amrunt of money dropped dramatically in 1968 to 1969 we raised taxes there was a sharp drop in reported income in tax collections and economic activity by contrast when we cut taxes in the 1920s the amount we raised went up when we cut taxes in 1946 and 1948 the amount we raised went up when we cut taxes in 196465 the amount we raised went up when we cut taxes in 1978 the amount we raised in capital gains went up overseas when germany cut taxes in 1948 the amount they iiised went up when japan cut taxes in 1950 the amount of money they raised went up when puerto rico cut taxes from 1977 to 1979 they increased their jobs and they increased their tax receipts now why does this happen it happens because every time we raise taxes remember the liberal democrats are talking about a 1 450 per worker tax increase over all the taxes you have already paid they are talking about raising it 1 450 per worker that means more people cheat more people avoid doing the things they get taxed for more people decide it is not worthwhile to go to work more people decide it is not worthwhile to stay in business and what happens the number of jobs goes down the amount of tax money we get in goes down the deficit gets bigger we have more unemployment we are sicker as it country by contrast what happens when you cut taxes when you cut taxes all of a sudden people decide it is worthwhile to go out and do things let us take the capital gains cuts of 1978 many people who had money locked up in taxfree municipal bonds decided it was worthwhile to go back and start getting involved in activities you paid capital gains tax on because you cut taxes the result was and this is absolute historic fact this is not some theory the result was that the amount of money we got in tax revenues went up after we cut the capital gains tax the treasury got more money because there was a lower tax let me put it simply let us say we had a 50cent tax on swinging a baseball bat most americans would not swing baseball bats the ones who did would pay 50 cents every time they swung the bat but there would not be many people swinging it by contrast let us say we dropped that down to a nickel if 11 people were swinging a bat where yesterday only 1 person had done it at 50 cents all of a sudden you would be getting 55 cents off of what is only a nickel tax now that is the theory it shows up best near philadelphia where there are two bridges one charges a lot of money to cross the delaware river one charges a little bit to cross the delaware river guess which one gets the most money you are right the one that charges a little bit because most people looking at a choice between a bridge that is very expensive and a bridge that is very cheap choose the cheap bridge literally the government makes more money out of the cheap bridge than out of the expensive bridge now let us look in that sense at the liberal democratic budget that has been proposed that budget by raising taxes 145 billion 1 450 per working american guarantees that fewer americans will be at work more bankruptcies it guarantees that we will have a bigger deficit that there will be less savings and as a result we will pay higher interest rates now why would they pass a budget so clearly destructive the reason i think is twofold first despite the fact that we reached our peak of real takehome pay in 1965 despite the fact that we lost the entire decade of the 1970s as we ran out of jobs as we ran out of industry as we ran out of opportunities for working americans i honestly think liberal democrats simply have not learned those lessons that down deep they are so wedded to a strong central liberal welfare state they are so wedded to spending money in washington they believe so deeply that the american people are not smart enough to spend their own money and they believe so deeply in the need to raise taxes and spend that money through the bureaucracies here in the city that they just literally have not learned the lesson of failure of the last 17 years second i think that they are desperate because in fact when the american people voted to cut spending when the american people voted to cut taxes when the american people voted for a real change from a liberal welfare state to a conservative opportunity society in 1980 they challenged a lifetime of work on the part of liberal democrats the fact is that we are at a crossroads that we are trying to change the way america works that we are trying to leave enough money in the pockets of working americans that they can open a retirement account and save money that by saving that money they will bring down interest rates that we are trying to cut government spending here in washington so your government is not competing with you so instead of the government buying cars you can buy cars instead of the government spending the money here you can spend the money at home we are trying to change from a path which for a decade led us to decay and unemployment onto a path that we believe will make the 1980s a productive and successful period the choice is do we want to continue down the road toward a budget which is fundamentally false the liberal democratic budget has plans and assumptions in it that just clearly are not going to work this is one study of that budget and let me say candidly that faced with the responsibility after 28 years of being in power the liberal democrats have run the house since 1955 january and after all those years of being in power faced with the real crisis in social security they hide from it faced with the real problems of big spending they hide from it faced with the real crisis of taxation they hide from it what do they offer in that budget they offer higher taxes they offer a chance to cut defense spending the one area the american people said in 1980 we needed to increase they offer a chance to continue down the same path of the welfare state we have been on and they do so under the phony banner of a set of assumptions that are fundamcntally wrong they have created a crisis which is false and then in answer to that crisis they set up medicine that is even more false it is a little bit as though you go as a patient to your doctor having a cold and your doctor says no no you do not have a cold you need brain surgery and offers you an operation when all you needed was mild medicine the current numbers we are being given for the size of the deficit are as phony as being told you have a brain tumor when in fact you have a spring cold the fact is the american economy is begining to turn around after 10 years of losing jobs losing factories being less and less competitive we have finally taken the medicine cutting spending and cutting taxes that gives us a chance to be healthy i yield to my good friend from new york the architect of a policy which

the voting rights act of 1965 has been hailed as one of the most successful civil rights legislation passed by congress the purpose of this law is to assure the right of minority citizens to register and to vote provisions of the act protect these voting rights as well as offer protection to minorities in jurisdictions where discrimination has be blatant as a result of the voting rights act millions of black and hispanic american citizens have been given the right to vote statistics from the 1980 presidential election illustrate the success of this act for example the rate of black voter registration in southern states included in the act was estimated to be approximately 59 percent compared with 29 percent black voter registration before 1965 despite this and other success resulting from the act the voting rights act is still desperately needed the unitedstates commission on civil rights found that the goals of the act have remained unfulfilled in its september 1981 report

financing of the alaskan natural gas pipeline with passage of the alaskan gas transportation act angta of 1976 congress made a clear statement to the effect that completion of the alaska natural gas pipeline was in the national interest in the intervening years i have seen no new evidence suggesting a need to revise this statement the alaskan gas pipeline is still a key component in our efforts to meet our energy needs in a selfsufficient and lesscostly manner the proven natural gas reserves located in the prudhoe bay region of alaska are estimated to be 26 trillion cubic feet or 13 percent of our domestic natural gas reserves furthermore there are 100 trillion p bic feet in potential reserves in alaska although natural gas production in the lower 48 can be expected to increase under gas price deregulation studies prepared for the pipeline consortia and energy projections made by the department of energy demonstrate that there will be a clear continuing need for natural gas by american consumers throughout the end of this century also gas production in the lower 48 will not be sufficient to meet that need indeed a shortfall will exist in the mid1980s even with access to alaskan natural gas clearly the proven gas reserves in alaska are something we cannot ignore the alternative to accessing alaskan gas in a timely and efficient fashion is continuing dependence on the importation of foreign oil the alaskan gas which will be shipped through the proposed transportation system will initially be able to replace 400 000 barrels of oil per day ulltimately when the system is operating at full capacity the gas will replace 600 000 barrels per day the resulting savings in payments for foreign oil will be 7 billion in the first year alone assuming a conservative 1987 price for oil of 50 a barrel with these facts before us the question we must answer is not whether we must access the alaskan natural gas but rather when and how i believe the alaskan natural gas pipeline will be the most efficient economical and safe method of transporting the natural gas from alaska to the regions of the lower 48 where it is most needed it is true that the initial cost of alaskan gas to the consumer will be high in the first years most assessments place the cost in the range of 9 20 to 9 35 per million btus in the early years however the effect of debt amortization over the 20 year life of the project will mean considerably lower gas prices for the consumer average costs deflated to 1980 dollars are projected to be in a range of 4 65 to 5 10 per million btus during the project life certainly these cost figures will be highly competitive with the rising cost of oil and alternative energy forms at the end of this decade and through the next in fact the cost of natural gas shipped through the pipeline system works out to about one half of the projected average btu delivered cost of oil over the same period and this does not figure in the cost of the continued purchase of foreign oil on our balance of trade sheet to those who are concerned that ultimately financial participation by the federal government will be required let me be clear this pipeline will be a privately financed project if it is to go forward there is no question it is a massive project if the decision is made eventually in the private sector to finance it the gas pipeline will be the largest and most ambitious project to ever be financed privately the pipeline will cross 4 800 miles of arctic and nonarctic terrain in the united states and canada it will provide at least 16 000 american jobs and will have the capacity to deliver between 2 billion and 3 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day the total cost for completion of the project could run as high as 54 billion in 1987 dollars is it not reasonable that the investment community and the pipeline participants would be sensitive to the regulatory climate and the many factors which have a bearing on the viability of the project as a whole certainly the obstacles to private financing of such a project as this would be great but not impossible in an unregulated envirdrnent however present laws and regulations are so rigid and restrictive that any favorable decision by the private sector is automatically precluded regulations imposed by the federal government and congress have molded the market an set conditions on any private financing arrangements which alter some very common business practices for instance in the matter of prebilling public utilities ordinarily pass on the cost of constructing nuclear facilities while construction is in process and no power is being delivered the practice is common in business though it has never been a part of energy transportation financing procedures nevertheless acceptance of this waiver package still affords maximum protection to the consumer since there are strict limits placed on when and how prebilling can begin all subject to a federal energy regulatory commission ferc decision the package also does not decrease the risk to the pipeline participants but maintains a high incentive to complete the project and to complete it on time the transmission companies will have invested at least 8 billion the oil and gas companies at least 9 billion that is a total of 17 billion they stand to lose if the pipeline is never completed and gas never flows therefore i urge acceptance of this waiver package in arder to allow the private sector to make a decision based on the true merits costs and risks of the alaskan

immigration laws in over 30 years the bill is complex but its purposes are simple to reform outmoded and unworkable provisions of the present immigration law and to gain control of our national borders this is an historic occasion not only because of the significance of the bill itself but also because an identical bill is being introduced in the senate by senator alan k simpson of wyoming chairman of the senate subcommittee on immigration and refugee policy it is rare when a house and a senate subcommittee chairman agree to introduce an identical bill it is extraordinary when the chairmen are introducing such an identical bill on one of the most controversial subjects of our times it is even more extraordinary when the chairmen are from different parties and different regions of the country we have reached this point for two reasons first the issue of immigration is so important to our nation and the need to reform our laws is so pressing that all party and regional loyalties as well as differenaces must be transcended as elected representatives we must reflect the interests and concerns of those who elected us but we cannot also forget that on certain fundamental issuesnational defense foreign policy crime drug abuse and now immigrationthe importance of the subject requires a totally objective nonparochial approach the second reason we have come to this point in immigration reform is alan simpson he is an unusual man and an unusual senator he and his very capable staff have been a joy and a pleasure to work with during the past 13 months as we have studied this issue together before assuming the chairmanship last year as you all know senator simpson served as one of the members of the select commission on immigra tion and refugee policy chaired by my good friend father theodore m hesburgh president of notre dame my alma mater since becoming chairman of the senate subcommittee he has been extremely helpful to me and my staff and has been thoroughly cooperative as we have worked on this issue for the first time in 30 years our two subcommittees held joint hearings on the subject of immigration reform we have traveled together to study immigration problems most recently earlier this month to the state of florida we have traveled what i have termed the equivalent of the borscht circuit of immigration putting on our immigration today show at conferences such as one at williamsburg sponsored by the rockefeller and ford foundations and the conference at san diego sponsored by the san diego city club for these last few weeks we have had extensive detailed meetings on all aspects of the bill we are introducing today with a true dialog so that today we have a joint venture of which we are both proud what we are introducing today is a fair and equitable and workable and balanced bill neither of us is happy with each and every one of its provisions but we believe that as a whole it is the type of package that people who study this issue carefully will agree is the best approach to that most nettlesome of moral social economic and political of issuesimmigration senator simpson and i have traveled a long road to reach this point both of us have given exhaustive study to this issue right now i want to pay tribute to the six other members of my subcommitteesam hall of texas pat schroeder of colorado barney frank of massachusetts ham fish of new york dan lungren of california and bill mccollum of floridawho have participated in endless hours of hearings and meetings and acquired a firm understanding of this matter without them the product we have before us today would not have been possible i wish also to thank my professionally competent and personally devoted subcommittee staffharris miller skip endres peter regis gene pugliese and bonnie mcguirefor their fine help also i want to thank chairman peter w rodino jr of the full committee ranking minority member congressman robert mcclory and committee staff director garner cline for their consistent support let me review briefly what has transpired leading to the development of this legislation first the most recent three administrations have proposed major immigration reform presidents ford and carter and now president reagan have recognized the importance of immigration and all three proposed strikingly similar packages to deal with it all elements of earlier formulations are in the bill i am introducing the attorneys general who served under the three presidents i citedespecially our present attorney general william french smithdeserve spe cial commendation for their interest in immigration frankly as i told attorney general smith when he came before our subcommittee when they were wooing you to leave sunny california to come to washington i doubt that anybody bothered to advise you that the nettlesome immigration question would ue sitting there in the middle of your desk as the first of your many hot potatoes but to the attorney generals credit he has plunged into this issue with full dedication i hope he and the president will give their full and influential support to the bill senator simpson and i have drafted another element which helped produce our bill on immigration reform was the select commission on immigration and refugee policy which was established 4 years ago by congress and which just 1 year ago issued the most comprehensive report and set of recommendations on immigration since 1911 that commission was chaired by father hesburgh as i noted one of the most talented individuals of our age having chaired my own subcommittee in the study of this multifaceted issue for the past year i appreciate even more the talent of father hesburgh who was able to bring together so many diverse points of viewfrom eight members of congress four members of the previous administration and four public membersinto one comprehensive set of recommendations the work of that select commission has been invaluable to senator simpson and me in putting together our bill just as i believe that presidents ford carter and reagan will see a lot of what they recommended in our bill so do i believe that father hesburgh and the other commissioners will see a lot of their dedicated work reflected in our measure since becoming chairman of the house subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law last february i have spent more time on the immigration issue than on any other policy issue since my arrival in the house over 11 years ago my subcommittee held 12 days of extensive hearings on all aspects of immigration reform including as i noted earlier 4 days of joint hearings with senator simpsons subcommittee we have heard from witnesses from all walks of life we have heard the pros and cons articulated on every element of this bill even one who had never heard anything about immigration reform but took the time to read our hearings would quickly become a reigning expert on the issue senator simpson and i have not only learned from our hearings directed specifically to immigration reform but also from more generalized hearings on the operations of the immigration and naturalization service on the consular operations of the department of state on our refugee program and on other related immigration problems several of the problems dealt with in my bill were on private immigration bills highlighted in hearings i have conducted my subcommittee members and i have taken several major subcommittee investigative trips to places such as southern california florida mexico city southeast asia and europe reports of these trips have been published so others could obtain a more personal fceling for the issues before us finally we have had many private meetings with individurls concerned about immigration who have brought us information and insights which have proven invaluable in sum i do not think that anybody can say that we have not done our best to learn and understand i believe our bill reflects that the details of the bill senator simpson and i have prepared follow my remarks also to follow is a copy of a letter i addressed to the attorney general today dealing with the detention of haitians at the krome facility in miami suffice it now to say that i believe this bill to be fair balanced workable and equitable it should be enacted into law"],

contributions to the construction of the washington area subway system i think it is fair to say that gladys spellmans contribution in this respect has been simply remarkable her efforts in the early years as a county commissioner were critical in laying the groundwork for what was to become the system 19e are building and using today she not only had the foresight to see what was possible many years ago but in her subsequent roles as chairperson of the washington suburban transit commission as vice president of the local council of governments as a council member in prince georges county and finally as the fifth districts congressional representative gladys worked diligently to translate her ideas into reality there were many who observing the often fractious nature of interjurisdictional relations in this area said that producing a firstrate subway system in the nations capital just couldnt be done gladys is one of the reasons why in fact it has been done most

now in existence today another issue is the baltimorewashington parkway one of the reasons gladys is appreciated really on a daily basis by her constituents and by all of us in maryland was her work to overcome delays in government and other obstacles which had been putting off resurfacing and upgrading of the baltimorewashington parkway when it became apparent that longstanding disagreements between federal and state transportation agencies were precluding needed repairs from being performed on this highway gladys went to work as only gladys can she used her considerabb influence here in the congress to win a federal appropriation for the work because the highway is maintained by the park service she then worked closely with high way officials to make certain that the work was done quickly and done with a minimum of disruption to the commuters on the highway if this does not strike some as a major accomplishment just ask any of the thousands of hapless commuters who endured the potholes and other dangerous conditions on that highway while the various governmental agencies could not agree on how to go forward on the repairs this is a good illustration i thinkand that is all it is an illustrationof how gladys could tackle a problem and work with all the affected parties and come up with a solution that solves that problem on other local issues she simply worked tirelessly to preserve the impact aid funds for her district to compensate the fifth district for tax revenues lost due to the presence of federally owned land these funds were used to provide a quality education to the children of her district and to prevent placing an unfair tax burden on her local taxpayers she successfully kept intact the beltsville agricultural research center an extremely important part of her community gladys led the fight to keep a toxic waste dump from being located in her congressional district she played an instrumental role in bringing in federal dollars for a very much needed urban renewal project in college park the seat of our great state university and she worked tirelessly with our metro caucus in the house on regional issues in addition to the metro system in an effort to curb aircraft noise to resolve environmental problems facing the washington area and generally to promote cooperation among the governments and people of the washington area i think those of us who came to know and love gladys in the past years will obviously think of her accomplishments on local issues but i suspect we will remember her most as a master politician one with just extraordinary savvy who understood the political process as few i have ever known and one who could make it work for the people she represented she was the chief advocate in this institution and the chief spokesman for the cause and the interest of federal workers and i can tell you as one who also represents a lot of federal employees that gladys presence in this institution is missed by all of them and by all of us who seek to serve them she was probably the major proponent and executor of better intergovernmental relations in the house she had been president as i mentioned earlier of the national association of countries and nobody in this institution better understood the relationships between the federal state and local governments than gladys and how to fit them together and how to make them work i would like to speak for a moment about what i came to know as i sat here on the floor with gladys hour after hour during debate about the priorities in her life because they transcended the kinds of issues and the politics that i have been discussing foremost in those priorities i think would have to be what the distinguished gentlewoman from louisiana was talking about earlierher love and her loyalty to her family to her friends and to the staff who worked with her so brilliantly her children and her grandchildren were i can attest the most important things in her life i do not know how many times we were on the floor and stood in the back of the chamber when gladys comments turned to something that happened with her children or with her grandchildren she never lost sight of the members of her family despite the tremendous demands of being an active politician in this day and age and we all know she was an indefatigable politician another priority for gladys was her sensitivity to those individuals in our society who have afflictions maybe not many members here knew it but gladys was once blind fortunately she was able to overcome that handicap she understood perhaps because of that better than most the special problems of the handicapped assisting the handicapped and the downtrodden were in many respects chief priorities for gladys spellman as an elected official i could not talk about the priorities that gladys spellman has had without talking about her integrity and her absolute total honesty i gather that she learned from her father henry noonhe was a former head of the d g s stores here in the district of columbia he was known for conducting his business with the highest of ethics and integrity gladys was always guided in her ethics by her father gladys career as a public official was exemplary in that respect as in every other something that has been mentioned by others but i want to underscore was gladys spellmans belief in constituent service the distinguished gentlewoman from new jersey referred to it very eloquently gladys spellman established i am convinced one of the finest constituent services that the united states has ever seen she was always accessible to the people of prince georges county her chief duty as a member of congress she believed was to solve her constituents problems she never deviated from that commitment to her constituents and her everincreasing margins of victory i think were strong testimony to that fact let me say something about another quality of gladys which sometimes is not talked about with politicians but it is so true with her and that is her gutsthe gutsiness of this woman if ever there was a person who knew how to use a velvet glove with the impact of an iron fist it is gladys spellman she is a very gutsy womanon civil rights on issues of concern to women to federal employees to the people of her districtbut she also knew how to get things done in this institution and she accomplished a tremendous amount during her term in the house i want to piuse now to yield to another friend of gladys spellman"], [0.5444055795669556, 0.5444055795669556, 0, "for

keep the flow of oil stable during times of supply interruptions during the oil crisis of 1979 for example marathon maintained a 100percent allocation to customers whle other larger companies cut allocations in ohio by an average of 20 percent i am deeply disturbed about the loss of vigorous competition if these two oil companies are allowed to merge the chilling fact of this proposed merger is clearthe mobil corp would rather explore for oil on the floor of the new york stock exchange than searching for new oil in the ground even worse the merger of these two companies would actually decrease the competition in the energy marketplace combined a marathon mobil oil co would rank no 1 in terms of gasoline sales and no 1 in terms of crude oil delivered over unitedstates oil pipelines it would also rank second in terms of total refining capacity and refined petroleum product sales everybody who suffered through the oil crisis of this past decade must question whether such a merger serves the best interest of the country by taking over marathon mobil will severely curtail all competitive aspects of the marathon operation including the shipping production exploration refining and marketing these consequences lead me to believe that such an acquisition would violate section 7 of the clayton act i have written a letter to federal trade commission chairman james miller cosigned by the entire ohio congressional delegation requesting that the ftc conduct an immediate and thorough examination of all information necessary to determine whether mobils acquisition of marathon oil would be consistent with antitrust laws and public policy considerations i have also called upon the distinguished chairman of the house judiciary committee mr rodino and the chairman of the senate judiciary commitee mr thurmond to convene hearings as soon as possible to consider the antitrust implications of the acquisition i believe serious antitrust implications must be considered when the

promote free and vigorous competition most important i am gravely concerned about the impact such a merger would have on the job market in my district and throughout ohio just yesterday the hold

saving time and sets at 5 42 standard time or 6 42 daylight saving time for a length of day of 11 hours and 31 minutes thus there would be mare daylight available on this day than on october 31 where there is presently only available this year 10 hours and 33 minutes of daylight so unless you are going to change the october 31 date it is absurd to say that the march 7 date is unrealistic unfair or a change in the way that the sunlight is affecting us what really causes the danger here which has been discussed is the fact that mother nature exists and shortens her days as the sun moves toward the equator from the tropic of cancer the shortest day of the year the solstice is on december 21 and is where the sun rises at 7 12 and sets at 4 17 allowing 9 hours and 5 minutes of daylight there is nothing we can do about that fact the fact is that on that day children get up in the dark go to school in the dark and often come home in the dark we also must ilk our cows and take care of our farm animals in the dark remember again that if you wait until april 30 to switch over you miss the entire months of march and april during which you could use early morning light the sun rises on standard time at 4 44 on april 30 assuming a great many people of this country and i assume most people of this country arise between the hours of 6 30 and 7 oclock in the morning or averaging 6 45

sun is rising at 5 57 and on march 31 it is rising at 5 29 the effect of that again is that you are losing light early hours of operable daylight when people could be using it the reason that this occurs by the way is that when we are moving toward the solstice in december in late fall the suns declination is at a slower rate than when it is moving out of the solstice going into the spring where the sun rises its declination its angle to the earth rises faster this is mother natures way of giving nature more sunlight and it behooves us to take advantage of that sunlight ben franklin

access that does not differ because of income race or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better during this decade"], [6.35385513305664e-05, 0.5000635385513306, 0, "one of the things i think as we are debating this continuing

of the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from new jersey mr courter will do the necessary thing make up for the earlier mistake in the previous vote and support the gentleman from new jersey and give the president the flexibility he needs to negotiate away the soviet capability in chemical warfare i would urge the members to think this matter through carefully and objectively and salvage the proper position for our national defense by supporting the courter amendment i support the administrations program on modernization of our chemical warfare capability since 1969 the united states has not manufactured lethal or incapacitating chemical weapons whereas the soviets have engaged in prolonged unilateral buildup the soviet threat is heightened by the use of chemical and biological warfare in afghanistan and southeast asia all executive agencies concerned with national security as well as previous congresses have concluded that we can no longer delay modernization of our chemical warfare deterrent a modest one measured against soviet capabilit es our military must be able to deter threats to ourselves and our allies which requires alequate unitedstates stocks the decision to modernize our chenbal weapons capability was sundertaken only after long and painstaking examination of the armed forces obsolete and deteriorating assets much emphasis has been placed in debate on binary weapons it should be stressed that what the binary system is in essence is a safer way to store and use chemical weapons binary weapons are not much more lethal than the cw weapons we now have but much of out present stocks are becoming obsolete t ey simply do not fit into modern delivery systems the united states does not plan to increase its total number of chemical munitions but simply to modernize them actually with a slight decrease they will be much more capable according to the administration of its fiscal year 1983 budget presentation 70 percent is based on defensive requirements 10 percent is for the safe destruction of obsolescent weapons and only about 20 percent is devoted to the binary program an important element of modernization according to executive branch witnesses the united states has kept its allies fully informed of its program and of its decisions over the past several years to begin modernization no allied government expressed opposition or otherwise commented on the substance of the decision to seek funds for production for many years it has been agreed nato doctrine that an effective chemical warfare retaliatory capability is an essential part of the continuum of deterrence our allies like ourselves are committed to seeking through arms control a complete ban on the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons they and we are pressing for such an agreement in the committee on disarmanent in geneva recognizing that the problems of verification and effective compliance must be overcome chemical weapons are awesome of that can be no doubt they are no more frightening than nuclear weapons however it is my belief that it is only by having a credible nuclear arsenal that we have deterred the use by the soviets of either their nuclear weapons or nuclear blackmail i believe there is an accurate analogy here i believe that we must have a credib e deterrent in chemical weapons as well inasmuch as chemical weapons unlike nuclear weapons are being used by the soviets and their allies today there is an even more urgent need to maintain a chemical warfare deterrent this is not to say that we should not urgently pursue arms control and reduction in nuclear weapons we should it is unitedstates policy to do so but we can only negotiate controls and reductions from a position of strength we should improve our defenses against chemical warfare destroy our obsolescent weapons and modernize our stockpile the administrations bill provides for these things debate about chemical warfare has yet to identify a deterrent that does not include a chemical weapons component without posing the risks of undesirable escalation or unacceptable accommodation the united states is working to achieve through negotiations a verifiable ban on all chemical weapons until that time however soviet incentives to use chemical weapons against us or our allies must be eliminated this can be done by modernizing and maintaining an adequate chemical warfare deterrent the modernization of our chemical weapons does not represent adecision to place greater emphasis upon chemical warfare nor to match soviet capabilities the unitedstates objective is to have the safest smallest level of chemical mualtions which provides the deterrent we need to repeat the administrations goal is a complete and verifiable ban on the development production and stockpiling of chemical weapons the sticking point in our negotiations with the soviet union on these weapons is the latters unwillingness to accept reasonable provisions for verification of their destruction the soviets have also not been willing to agree to effective procedures for assuring continued compliance i urge my colleagues to support the administration on this important measure"], [9.962916374206543e-05, 0.49990037083625793, 1, "a potent grassroots movement is sweeping our nation unlike any i have witnessed in my years in congress

in strong support of the gentlemans amendment i have joined in sponsoring this amendment because i share his concern that the proposed metropolitan washington airports policy will have a substantial adverse effect on competition in the airline industry and on airline services and fares let me start with a brief discussion with the environmental issue i think the opponents of this amendment simply have to face up to the fact that the supplemental environmental impact statement prepared to accompany the policy and prepared by dot which is proposing this policy specifically admits that elimination of the atc authority that is the authority to fly when the air controllers say they have some space will produce and i quote no significant change in contour areas or population impacted upon implementation so the suggestion that this policy is going to be some sort of panacea for people in the national airport flight path i think has been knocked into a cocked hat by dots own admission i think the basic question we get to is whether we really believe in the deregulation policies that this congress and this administration have enunciated as our basis policy for the airways i would submit to the house that the proposed regulations are basically anticompetitive and in violation of the free competition policy and that they therefore fly in the face of what this congress has chosen to do by way of regulation of the airline industry i would also point out that the department of transportation has p roposed this policy without knowing the economic impact so that the department itself has to admit that it simply has not done the homework on what the competitive impacts of this policy would be now why do i say that the impacts are anticompetitive that is because the policy very plainly favors one type of air service over other competitive types of air service the fact of the matter is this policy says if you have a shuttletype service and you run extra sections in order to take care of the additional crowds that show up at the gates that extra section does not count against the number of slots you get under this policy so a shuttletype operatorand we know there is basically one using this airportis free to have all of the extra sections that the traffic will generate and this policy says go ahead and do it create all of the noise you want with your extra sections we are favoring that kind of operation but to someone who wants to compete with the shuttletype of operation by offering a different type of service a scheduled service and wants to use the socalled atc space that is availableand it generally can be used to run a scheduled type of service a competitive service that operates a different way with advance regulationsthis policy says we are going to throw every roadblock we can in your way because we are not going to allow you to have those atc slots even though your opposition your competitor can have all of the space they need for the extra traffic and we wll not count that against them i say that that is basically anticompetitive it is no place for the department of transportation to be overriding what congress has done and saying we are going to favor one type of service over a competitive type mr green i am very much aware of service of this new service tzhat is basically what we in con mr wilson and soon to

anderson and i would like to associate myself with his able description of the amendment being offered and to compliment him for his leadership patience and cooperation in bringing about the compromise legislative product we are presenting here today i would also like to commend our distinguished colleague from new jersey the chairman of the full committee on public works and transportation mr howard were it not for his diligence and initiative it is highly unlikely that we would have the opportunity to make what i believe are significant contributions to the federalaid highway system during the 1st session of the 97th congress on september 24 the committee on public works and transportation brought before this body h r 3210 a 1year highway bill intended to reconcile the authorizations for fiscal year 1982 with those contained in the reagan administration budget and also to make significant changes in the interstate highway program the interstate changes were intended to redefine interstate completion in terms more realistically achievable by shifting the emphasis on our interstate program from the new construction mode to one of maintaining our investment in a 42 500mile network i am sure i do not have to remind anyone in this chamber that because of our economic crisis it has been necessary to further reduce spending for fiscal year 1982 the amendment we have before us will achieve our highway objectives toward those highway budget reductions the obligation limitation for the federalaid highway system for fiscal year 1982 is set at 8 billion 200 million below the level set in the original house passed h r 3210 as well as in the budget reconciliation act while i know a number of you would have of interstate completion would be eligible under the expanded interstate 3r4r program the reduction in the interstate completion category corresponds directly with the expanded interstate 3r4r program this newly defined category will fund projects for interstate resurfacing restoring rehabilitation and reconstruction work items no longer eligible for funding under the interstate completion category will be eligible for funding under the interstate 4r1 category the federal share for both interstate construction and interstate 4r1 will be 90 percent the redefinition of interstate cornpletion and the new 4r1 program closely parallel the amendment offered by the distinguished gentleman from pennsylvania during the markup of h r 3210 before the subcommittee on surface transportation last may the ranking minority member of the subcommittee deserves our recognition and commendation for the lead role he exercised in promoting a redefinition of the interstate program this year his efforts are chiefly responsible for transforming a simple 1year authorization bill into a significant piece of legislation the combined funding level for the interstate programs has been increased for fiscal year 1982 from 3 6 billion to 4 025 billion in addition the interstate 411 category has been authorized for a second year at a level of 800 million during the floor debate on h r 3210 this past september several members expressed concern about the proposed elimination of the half percent minimum setaside for smaller states the amendment under consideration retains the provision guaranteeing that every state will receive at least onehalt of 1 percent of the interstate of the interstate construction funds as was pointed out by our colleagues from delaware vermont new hampshire north dakota south dakota maine nebraska and wyoming the elimination of the half per cent minimum would have denied these states more than half of the interstate money they had been receiving and for which they were preferred to be rising in support of a multiyear highway bill a position taken by our senate colleagues i believe a consensus has been reached supportive of at least immediate needs of our nations highway program by reducing costs to complete the interstate system to a more achievable objective and by expanding our interstate restoration efforts to help begin the task of insuring that our nations most costly transportation investment is adequately protected even the staunchest supporters of multiyear legislation agree that it is better to make the changes in the definition of interstate completion and begin the interstate 4r1 program than to allow projects to be obligated during fiscal year 1982 that would be ineligible under the new defi nition this amendment to h r 3210 satisfies those objectives this amendment represents a true compromise witoi regard to the interstate highway system components both this chamber and the senate redefine interstate completion to reduce the costtocomplete estimate by some 15 to 17 billion while both the senate and house versions were similar certain elements of the interstate program would have been eligible under one version but not the other in an effort to resolve these differences the two redefinitions have been merged to insure that any project eligible under one of the redefinitions would still be eligible under the redefinition contained in this amendment this merging has been completed and the result is a cost estimate reduced from more than 53 billion to one in the range of 38 billion the new interstate completion definition would permit up to six lanes per designated interstate highway in rural areas and urban areas up to 400 000 population and up to eight lanes per designated interstate highways in areas of 400 000 population and above those lane limitations would not include high occupancy vehicle lanes the thrust behind the new definition would be to make interstate construction funds available only to construct interstate segments to a minimum level of acceptable service consisting of full access control and a pavement assigned to accommodate traffic anticipated for the next 20 years work no longer fundable under the redefinition planning for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 and these reductions in interstate construction funds would not have been offset by increases and interstate 4r1 funds under our original bill in several instances these states have completed their interstate systems and have major interstate restoration needs the amendment under consideration cures that defect also included in our amendment is a provision which will provide full federal funding for rebuilding the woodrow wilson bridge that carries interstate 95 over the potomac river during the floor debate on h r 3210 our colleagues mrs halt of maryland and mr wolf and mr paris of virginia ably described the exigent circumstances that existed on this federallyowned bridge on the interstate highway system the provision in this amendment would permit federal interstate funds to be expended to rehabilitate the bridge at its current lane capacity by the federal government however to insure that appropriate agreements are reached between the three jurisdictions that most significantly benefit from the woodrow wilson bridge namely the commonwealth of virginia the district of columbia and the state of maryland no moneys may be obligated until the secretary of transportation is assured that the three jurisdictions have executed agreements to insure the bridges continued viability we would strongly urge the secretary to encourage the three jurisdictions to expeditiously reach an agreement for the transfer of ownership away from the federal government i would like to take this opportunity to commend governor dalton from the commonwealth of virginia and governor hughes from the state of maryland for calling this serious problem to the attention of the congress and for their outstanding leadership in the area of transportation in addition to the interstate changes the amendment to h r 3210 contains a few other significant provisions a section has been included which gives the secretary of transportation the needed authority to waive technical compliance with federal requirements in the acquistion of certain real property in connection with the highway project in santa rosa calif under this provision the state of california would be permitted to use a portion of its federalaid apportionment to reimburse the city of santa rosa for costs already incurred by the city in connection with the federalaid project which meets federal standards this provision rights a misunderstanding that has existed for several years and does not involve any additional money to be expended from the federalaid highway system i have had conversations with the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on surface transportation the gentleman from pennsylvania mr shusm and agree with him that the interstate redefinition changes and projects of national significance are too important not to resolve immediately and therefore cannot be delayed until we take up multiyear highway legislation during the next session however i want the gentleman from pennsylvania to know that i share his concern that funds may not currently be distributed in a way to direct dollars to where they are most needed or could be most effectively used in maintaining a national highway network i know the gentleman is examining new bases for distributig interstate 411 funds i will be most supportive of considering formula changes next year to achieve a more equitable distribution i am also aware of mr sinisters concerns about unitedstates route 522 in huntingdon county pa this situation sounds to me like the type of project that priority primary funds was intended to address i believe the designation of this project as a priority primary route should be given favorable consideration during our deliberations next session on multiyear highway legislation finally the amcndment to h r 3210 contains a provision of national significance n6t related to the interstatb highway system in the surface transportation act of 1978 we included a provision for the construction of a bypass highway that would reroute traffic around the redwood national park we thought at that time that we had provided both the necessary funds and authority to construct the project i would like to direct my colleagues attention to section 12 of the compromise bill this section deals with a matter which has been and continues to be of major iportance to the congress briefly stated section 12 does two things first subsection a of section 12 provides an additional authorization of 55 million for the redwood bypass highway project bringing the total amount authorized to 105 million and second subsection b of section 12 assures that the redwood bypass highway project will provide the economic stimulus and the infrastructure improvement which congress intended to help offset at least partially the loss of employment and economic activity associated with expansion of the redwood national park as i am sure my colleagues remember in enacting section 152 of the federalaid highway act of 1978 and section 101 a 5 of the redwood national park expansion act of 1978 congress provided for the construction of a bypass highway around the redwood national park in order to divert motor vehicle traffic around the park so as to best serve the needs of the traveling public while preserving the natural beauty of the park the congress regarded this project as unique a fact clearly reflected in the priority treatment accorded the project in the federalaid highway act of 1978 and the redwood national park expansion act of 1978 this priority reflects the need for the project long recognized by the congress in terms of mobility and safety for the traveling public access to the park preservation of its environmental values and both economic stimulus and infrastructure improvement to help offset partially the loss of employment and economic activity associated with expansion of the redwood national park section 12 of the compromise bill before us today addresses two problems which have arisen since the project was authorized in 1978 the first problem deals with the cost of the project the california department of transportation has estimated that the construction costs of the preferred alternative taking into account inflation would be 102 million in 1986 costs since congress authorized only 50 million in the federalaid highway act of 1978 an additional autborization is necessary in order to remedy this situation subsection a of section 12 of the compromise bill authorizes an additional 55 million~ in contract authority for the redwood bypass highway project bringing the total amount authorized to 105 million this amount should be sufficient to cover the federal share of the entire cost of the project"], [0.00020626187324523926, 0.49979373812675476, 0, "i move to strike the last word i takl this time to make a brief statement that under the administration of the

the funds and providing the services but as far as a formula distribution of funds there is nothing like that at all the funding is as i understand it 100 percent on the part of the federal government however that does not preclude contributions from local units of government or from private sources as a matter of fact there are many private sources of funds that are utilized in the legal services agencies that are located around the country but i can understand the interest in amendments that would provide for 30 percent of the distribution of the funds in rural areas or a better division of the funds because it is at the present time a hodgepodge hitormiss very inequitable distribution of federal funds this in a sense suggests to me that it would be far better if we distributed funds through a block grant program and then left to the local units of government the local agencies the decisionmakers at that level how the funds should be applied where there is the need for legal aid agencies and where there is not and to control the kinds of legal aid services that are provided in the communities or the areas that are to be served i merely rise at this time to suggest that i understand the complaints that are made about the distribution and the maldistribution of funds the inequitable way in which they are distributed i have in front of me the annual report of the legal services corporation for 1979 just a cursory review of this indicates that some small communities are getting millions of dollars and some larger communities are getting far less some areas are served some are not served i do not know how you can say that this is a great national program which must be perpetuated i do not know how you can say that because we have this experience of the last 7 years that somehow this program is so valuable that we must perpetuate this in exactly the same form through a federally subsidized bureaucratic system even though the legal services corporation is directed by publicspirited individuals and the president is going to have the opportunity to appoint them alland they are fine people i am not suggesting otherwisedo they know best about how to distribute funds or how to allocate funds in waukegan ill or to some small community in arizona or mississippi or wherever it does not seem to me that they do and i think that this program is being miscast in the way that it is being set forth in this form i just want to reiterate my support of legal aid for the poor at the appropriate time i expect to offer an alternative which will carry out the goals of
