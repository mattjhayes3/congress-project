financing of the alaska natural gas transportation system anots my home state of california is dependent on natural gas as an energy source fortynine percent of californias nontransportation needs are met with natural gas ninetythree percent of the househols use natural gas for water heating 91 percent use it for space heating and 95 percent use it for cooling clearly the availability of natural gas is critical to the economic wellbeing and energy security of my state therefore i was alarmned by a recent report issued by southern california gas co stating that natural gas supplies currently available to southern california will not be sufficient to serve the area fully by the 1980s given this project shortfall the need to develop access to new supplies of natural gas is obvious our best potential new source of domestic natural gas is obvious our best potential new source of domestic natural gas is prudhoe bay on alaskas north slope the largest single finding of oil and natural gas proven reserves at prudhoe bay are estimated at 26 trillion cubic feet and represent about 13 percent of united states total proven gas reserves additional potential gas reserves on alaskas north slope left to be discovercd are projected at 100 to 200 trillion cubic feet the alaska national gas transportation system will provide access to these proven reserves equivalent to at least 400 000 barrels of oil per day with potential energy supplies of perhaps 10 times that amount the 4 800 mile pipeline will transport natural gas through alaska and canada to nearly every state in the union and will have an initial capacity to provide over 4 percent of our nations daily natural gas needs the angts will provide a stable and reliable supply of energy to this country a supply thant ill not be subject to opec embargoes or escalating prices at a projected total cost of 40 billion the pipeline will be the most expensive private construction project ever conceived last may the angts financing plan was presented to four unitedstates commercial banks for consideration in august the four bank group advised that although the project rould be privately financed without governmental guarantees and or participation certain steps must be taken to modify the financial requirements established under the 1976 alaska natural gas transportation act this act had specifically provided for the waiver of federal laws if necessary to facilitate success of the project the commercial banks told thle pipeline sponsors that unless these financial modifications or waivers wvere approved reliable private sector financing could not be secured for the project in other words the pipeline will not be built unless these waivers of law as proposed to congress by president reagan on october 15 and contained in senate joint resolution 115 are approved the most controversial provision of the waiver package is the one which would permit prebilling senate joint resolution 115 would permit billing of unitedstates gas consumers for the construction costs of the pipeline before the pipeline is fully operational the federal energy regulatory commission ferc would establish a date certain for expected completion of the entire project probably 1987 for the purpose of thle waiver the system wvould be divided into three segments canada alaska and the conditioning plant at prudhoe bay each of which would have specific billing schedules if any one or two of these three segments of the pipeline were completed before the entire pipeline but after the date certah consumers at the discretion of ferc could be prebilled for the completed segments the argument has been raised that this prebilling proposal would lock consumers into multibillion dollar payments whether or not the pipeline is ever completed this is simply not the case the prebilling provision of the waiver proposal gives ferc the discretionary power to allow companies decembet 10 1 981 planning to move gas through the project to begin billing gas customers first only after a date selected by ferc as reasonable completion of the entire system probably 1987 second only after full completion and testing of one of two of three basic segments of the line third only for the debt service and related costs on the unitedstates sements of the project fourth only after billions of dollars of the sponsors own risk capital has been invested without return until project completion and fifth only for those costs prudently incurred and actually paid the absolute worst case consumer financial risk a highly unlikely contingency of utter project failure after completion of the two most expensive segments of the system would involve average consumer payments of less than 1 per month during the 20 years required to discharge the debt in full one oil embargo or a revolution would add far more to consumer energy bills in contrast given a worst case scenarlo unitedstates private sponsors of the project would lose all their equity investment in such a case big business would be the big losersnot the consumers furthermore in the event of any delay beyond the date certain assuming ferc has approved the prebilling as just and reasonable any payments by consumers would serve to reduce and lower their later payments when the system is finished consumers would under no circumstances be asked to pay for sections of the system that are not completed approval of the waiver package also fulfills a national commitment to canada in july 1980 president carter informed prime minister trudeau that he would ask congress to allow the participating canadian companies to collect their full service costs upon completion of the canadian segment of the line in july 1980 congress expressed its unqualified support for the project in a formal resolution s con res 104 canadas national energy board relied upon this presidential and congressional support when it acted to permit new gas exports and construction of the prebuild segments in canada reneging on this commitment by not building the alaskan section of the pipeline would be extemely detrimental to relations with canada what the whole issue boils down to is this no waiver package means no pipeline without acceptance of the waiver package it will be impossible to obtain private sector financing for what is universally regarded as an invaluable and even essential project lack of private financing support would either lead to the projects abandonment or force outright government financing the only way to insure private sponsorship and funding of this pipeline project so vital to our national energy interest is to approve the waiver package as contained in senate joint resolution 115 e"], [0.40603357553482056, 0.40603357553482056, 0, "in the continuing discussions of the budget there are three recurring themes which i think merit our critical reexamination they are first that we cannot make cuts in defense spending without seriously damaging our national security posture second that we cannot impose tax measures without impairing the presidents economic recovery program and third that we cannot reduce nondefense spending without hurting the poor one or more of these propositions are usually propounded by those with vested interests or holding highly partisan political viewpoints unquestioned acceptance of any of them impedes our progress toward the bipartisan consensus we must ultimately achieve given that we are to reduce the projected deficits both in fiscal year 1983 and the out years and i believe we must no such proposition can be sacrosanct our task i submit is to reduce the enormous deficits which threaten to starve the nations credit market and to do it with a commonsense compassionate and equitable approach to budgetary priorities we must use commonsense in identifying those components of the budget whose unrestrained growth is primarily responsible for the deficits and in acting to curb their growth in protecting and strengthening programs in education research and development job training and other areas that are critical to achieving and maintaining economic vigor and growth in maintaining and in finetuning a tax policy conducive to economic recovery and growth and in providing reasonably and adequately for our defense we must be compassionate in our treatment of our needy and disadvantaged insuring that they do not suffer undue hardship in any restructuring of the programs which constitute their safety net finally we must be equitable in distributing the burdens of our economic difficulties no individual group or regionshould share them disproportionately there is no mystery concerning the identity of the budget components fueling the deficit they are as table 1 shows payments to individuals that is the entitlement programs defense and the interest on the national debt all have been growing at rates considerably in excess of rates of increase in prices wages and nominal gnp clearly these rates are not sustainable large budget components cannot increase for long at rates exceeding economic growth without creating insurmountable deficits yet we are asked to increase defense spending at the highest peacetime rate in our history and we have programed into our laws through an inappropriate cola indexing scheme indefinite and unrestrained growth in entitlements moreover the deficit monster we are creating feeds on itself if we do not control deficit spending we are going to be facing the ominous specter of budgets whose most significant component is the interest on debt represented in earlier deficits table 1 is revealing in one other respect the domestic discretionary programsincluded in the other human resources and all other categoriesconstitute a relatively smaller portion of the budget and have already been cut significantly in fiscal year 1982 we can and should continue to scrutinize these discretionary programs for potential budgetary savings but we cannot in fairness and commonsense look again to them exclusively while omitting from our purview the much larger defense and entitlement components defense we all recognize the responsibility of the federal government to provide for a strong national defense but that should not blind us to two facts about the proposed defense budget first it is more than we can afford and second the money is not being wisely spent we do not need nor can we afford a 17percent increase in the pentagon budget a 5 percent annual real growth rate in defense spending will permit us to meet our international commitments improve compensation for the men and women who serve our nation step up our readiness meet the soviet challenge and still save 8 billion in the nex t fiscal year and tens of billions more in the years thereafter we have found that we cannot solve our social problems by throwing money at them similarly we should not expect to achieve a sound defense by merely buying more and more expensive sophisticated military hardware what i am suggesting is that there are components in a strong defense posture other than quantifiable military strength as represented by the number of men under arms and the number of items of military hardware available we americans are not a militaristic people we are uncomfortable managing a powerful peacetime military establishment and with using it as an instrument of policy when our sense of national purpose is clear to us we can muster our resources for a phenomenal military effort as evidenced in world war ii but without this clear sense of purpose we are ineffective as our vietnam experience amply demonstrates we need to project an image to ourselves to our allies and to the uncommitted of a nation which is a model of economic success military strength and opportunity and compassion for its citizens to achieve this we must establish and maintain a balanced set of national priorities in the present context of peacetime and economic recession we should ask for a more restrained growth in defense spending conducive to economic recovery and for continued funding of vital energy health education and welfare programs there are a number of compelling reasons apart from the question of affordability for restraining growth in defense spending the decline in major weapons systems procurement in the 1970s has diminished our defense industrial base our economy has experienced a shift toward high technology and serviceoriented industries and away from the basic hardware and heavy machines that have long been and still are the staples of the industrial complex required for defense production although there may be sufficient prime contractors bidding for major weapons systems contracts there is a shortage of potential subcontractors and a shortfall in their capacity to produce the necessary subcomponents many subcontractors have gotten out of defense production because of its uncertainties and low profit potential there is also a shortage of the skilled engineers technicians and machinists required for a massive defense buildup true the market forces unleashed by increased military spending will ultimately correct these deficiencies but it is unrealistic to expect that they will be overcome immediately we can also expect a better performance from our military planners if we provide for more limited but more predictable patterns of growth in defense spending we do not get the best mix of strategy forces and equipment when we alternately curtail spending and then offer blank checks to our military leaders such large swings in funding promote a climate of waste and inefficiency let us offer the more modest but sustainable buildup consistent with 5 percent real growth in the defense budget on the average this rate is only 2 percent short of that asked for by the president over the next 5 years yet it would save 8 3 billion in fiscal year 1983 and 98 1 billion over 5 years how are we to effect the fiscal year 1983 savings where should we offer less than the president has asked i hope not in the area of operation and maintenance it would be shortsighted to sacrifice readiness in the interest of acquiring new weapons systems many of which are of arguaoly questionable cost effectiveness rather we should make some hard choices among these new procurement programs and seek further improvements in efficiency reports by the house appropriations committee and the congressional republican study committee last year found 46 ways the armed services mishandle funds representing at least 15 billion in potential savings outgoing comptroller general stoats cited a number of measure which if implemented could save dod over 10 billion annually secretary weinberger and under secretary carlucci have made a commendable beginning with cost reducing management initiatives but much more can be done the strength of our defense rests not only on its armed forces but also on the continued availability of adequate energy economic stability and the skills and will and vigor of our people in our zeal for strengthening the armed forces and reducing discretionary spending let us be wary of budget cuts which undermine this be of support"], [0.40799480676651, 0.40799480676651, 0, "we price provision suught by distrigas all know that

and to which the subcommittee on monopolies and commercial law gave long and careful consideration there were times when i and others felt that our consideration was becoming altogether too long and too careful but the bill which we have ultimately reported is a good one and merits the support of every member it is difficult to discuss this legislation without some reference to h r 5235 formerly h r 2326 the bill introduced by chairman rodino and myself to clarify the application of the antitrust laws to export trade activities this was our initial response to the complaint that many american businessmen were unwilling or unable to compete with confidence in the international marketplace because of their uncertainty regarding their antitrust liability that bill reflects our belief that the proper response to exporters who believe the law is unclear is to clarify the law this it seems to me is far more important than the licensing procedures such as the provisions in the export trading legislation passed by the senate as the rodinomcclory bill has moved forward it became evident that nothing less than some sort of certification system was desired by the business community even if h r 5235 were to be enacted clarifying the nonapplication of our antitrust laws to purely foreign activities title ii of h r 1799 is the judiciary committees considered response it compares extremely favorably with the senate approach i might say in terms of simplified procedure expedit0ed processing and certain results it provides exporters with a binding advisory opinion on the legality of their proposed conduct rather than providing an outright antitrust exemption as the senate bill attempts to do this eliminates also the cumbersome requirement that exporters establish a special need as a condition precedent to exemption the 6nly issue to be decided in processing an application under our bill is whether the proposed conduct is likely to violate the antitrust laws of the united states the members of the monopolies and commercial law subcommittee were virtually unanimous therefore in deciding that this determination should be made by the department of justice rather than by the department of commerce there would seem to be little benefit conferred by an antitrust certificate from the department of commerce which the department of justice could attack and it would be wrong to bar the antitrust division from exercising its enforcement function in my opinion without its first having the opportunity to subject the proposed conduct to antitrust review an optional forwarding role for the commerce department is allowed nevertheless which should encourage the applicant to use that agencys informational and advisory services careful thought was also given to the question of damages which may be recovered by a person injured by an antitrust violation committed by a person acting pursuant to a certificate there is no question of course that treble damages lie for conduct outside of the certificate it is also possile however although unlikely that certified conduct may result in injury in domestic commerce although the administration and the senate have suggested that certified conduct should be totally immune from liability the judiciary committee of the house firmly believes that single damages are most necessary and appropriate it is sometimes forgotten that antitrust damages are not only a penalty but a protection and the person compensated most often will be another american business with a legitimate clair to be made whole for its antitrust injury single damages for domestic injury by the holder of an export trade certificate were perceived as a fair compromise between the traditional statutory treble damages and no damages if no damages were to be the rule the governmental agency granting certification would have to be more conservative in close cases granting benefits to fewer applicants furthermore fairness would also then require that greater procedural protections be provided for interested parties who feared future injury since such parties would subsequently be denied damages on the other hand with single damages as the rule certification could take place administratively without a hearing without third parties arguing their case and thus without protracted delays finally if no damages were to be the rule the only way a court could compensate the injured american business would be to hold the conduct in question to be ultra vires outside the certificate in which case treble damages would lie with a singledamages rule however the court would have a fairer solution availableone which compensates the injured party but does not punish the wrongdoer who believed that his conduct fell within the scope of the certificate some have argued that the senate bill is preferable because it protects exporters from lawsuits by providing zero damages rather than single damages where certified conduct causes the complained of injury but our committee has given this argument a long hard look talked to antitrust lawyers and found this argument without merit for the senate bill would only change the nature of pleading antitrust violations and probably result in treble damage awards on grounds that the conduct in question was ultra vires our bill would preserve and assure single damages for the injured plaintiff but would restrain the filing of lawsuits against exporters by means of the most liberal provision of attorneys fees for defendants within the sweep of my experience for if the certified conduct has not violated the antitrust laws the plaintiff must pay to the defendant exporter a reasonable attorneys fee even if the suit was brought in good faith and even if the suit was nonfrivolous that should make plaintiffs think twice about suing an exporter holding a certificate this bill has been carefully constructed to provide greater certainty to exporters by providing them the assurance of an antitrust review and certification procedure i believe it will enable american businessmen to compete with far greater confidence and freedom of action overseas this is what you want it is what i want

consume this debate opened with a statement from our committee chairman the gentleman from new jersey typical of his continued wise leadership in the area of immigration his was a message of urgency the time for action to regain control over our immigration policy is long overdue the burden in this debate rests squarely on those who at this late date object to effective enforcement policies one of the pleasures for me in this congress has been working with the gentleman from kentucky the chairman of the subcommittee few men give of themselves so much to realize necessary but difficult changes in our immigration laws i welcome the opportunity today to join my colleagues in speaking in support of h r 7357 the immigration reform and control act of 1982 this legislation represents the culmination of years of work the select commission on immigration and refugee policy held 12 regional hearings in different parts of the united states conducted 24 indepth consultations and authorized extensive social science and legal research a cabinetlevel task force carefully scrutinized the select commissions findings and recommendations the immigration subcommittees of both the house and senate heard from numerous witnesses from federal state and local governments business and labor organizations industry and agriculture religious and ethnic groups and civil liberties organizations the judiciary committee although unable to please everyone made a conscientious effort to accommodate very diverse concerns the genius of the simpsonmazzoli bill is reflected in its balance of competing interests the billby focusing on enforcement adjudications and legalizationaddresses the major issues related to the presence of undocumented aliens in the united states today the american people for many years have called upon the congress to confront our lack of control over our borders we have the opportunity in this congress to act with firmness to deter future illegal entry and at the same time reaffirm americas historic commitment to accept legal immigrants from other lands employer sanctions the centerpiece of immigration law enforcement is a key provision in this bill h r 7357 attempts to discourage the annual flow of hundreds of thousands of undocumented aliens by removing the major inaucement to illegal migrationthe magnet that draws people to our shoresthe opportunities for employment the concept of employer sanctions has received the support of a number of administrations favorable votes on two occasions in this body and the endorsementby a 14to2 voteof the select commission on immigration and refugee policy alternatives have been considered and found wanting employer sanctions is the only effective optionin the judgment of the many people who have focused on the problem of illegal immigration this legislation specifically guards against the possibility of making employers law enforcers sanctions are not imposed on employers who hire illegal aliens unknowingly the language of section 101 provides that it is unlawful to hire an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien with respect to such employment an employer that establishes that it has complied in good faith with the vertification requirements has established an affirmative defense i believe the statutory language as well as the legislative history will protect american businesses by limiting the application of employer sanctions to knowing violations the business roundtable by endorsing this bill has expressed its faith that employers will receive fair treatment contrary to what has been said the gao did not say employer sanctions were ineffective it said in other countries they will not be enforced h r 7357 moreover has been designed to protect ethnic minorities against invidious discrimination four separate provisions of this bill are designed to prevent discrimination employers of four or more persons who ignore a warning and fail to follow paperwork verification requirements will face a 500 civil penaltyfor each individual with respect to which such violation occurredregardless of whether the individual turns out to be a unitedstates citizen or lawful permanent resident alien by following the paperwork requirement the employer will know if the applicant is eligible he need not fear making a mistake the employer i say to my friend from california will discriminate against hispanics at his peril i am confident that we strengthened the protections against discrimination in the course of our full judiciary committee markup one important provision inserted by the committee directs the civil rights commission to monitor the enforcement of employer sanctions in addition the bill directs the attorney general the secretary of labor and the chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission to review and investigate complaints of discrimination another provision requires the president to consult with congress every 6 months concerning the implementation of employer sanctionsincluding possible discimination in employment the very extensive monitoring and reporting mechanisms are an expression of the importance the judiciary committee attaches to guarding against discrimination we are confident that existing civil rights legislation state and federal will provide an important measure of protection in many cases of discrimination based on national origin congressional oversight moreover will help insure that the new statute is properly enforced another major focus of this legislation is reform of the immigration adjudication process today exclusion deportation and asylum adjudications are beset with crippling delays h r 7357 upgrades the administrative adjudicatory structureby providing it greater independence and statureand thus minimizes the need for protracted judicial involvement the judiciary committee has preserved the critical role of the federal judiciary in adjudicating the important libertyrelated matters that arise in some immigration cases but has eliminated needless layering of review we have combined due process with necessary reforms this legislation finally recognizes that substantial numbers of illegal aliens are here to stay and responds realistically and humanely to their plight at the same time that we act with firmness to deter future illegal entry we must display compassion in our treatment of those aliens who have become a part of our society the conferral of a legal status on undocumented aliens with years of unitedstates residence will permit this population to come out of the shadows and contribute more to our country the select commission by a 16tozero vote favored a legalization program as part of its enforcement package precedents in unitedstates law for legalizing the status of undocumented aliens can be found in the registry datewhich serves as a statute of limitations on illegal entryand the discretionary remedy of suspension of deportation h r 7357 in my opinion sets appropriate cutoff dates for eligibility for legalization they are the same dates incorporated in s 2222 persons who entered the united states prior to january 1 1977 may qualify for permanent resident status and persons who entered prior to january 1 1980 may qualify for temporary residence statusa transition status leading to permanent residence after 3 years the approach of our judiciary committee and the other body represents an appropriate compromise between the views of those who would eliminate the legalization provisions entirely or only advance the registry date to 1973and those who would provide lawful permanent resident status to persons who entered prior to january 1 1982 a failure to provide a substantial legalization ignores the equities of persons who have lived in the united states for a number of years perpetuates the existence of a large underclass of illegal aliens and continues to subject citizens and lawful permanent resident aliens to enormous social costs the distinguished chairman of our committee pointed out in his eloquent remarks that many years already have been lost in

it totally ineffective and that the only way they could give away 1 billion in the short span of the summer remaining was to run up to the top of the washington monument and throw that money out of the window the bill was redrafted coincidentally just in time for the elections there has already been 1 9 to 2 3 billion approved by the administration in the recent tax bill to extend unemployment compensation benefits there is already 192 million in the 1982 continuing resolution provided for youth employment on top of 3 billion in other jobs programs in that same bill there is already 45

economic recovery is anticipated so there may not be a need for this bill by the time it gets under way most importantly the 1 billion increase in the deficit is bound to regenerate inflation and high interest rates loosely drafted jobs bills are less efficient than the marketplace they cost more to operate they do not work they add to the cost of government and to the deficit and that adds to the strain on interest rates and keeps production down the exact opposite of what we are trying to accomplish here i will give you a perfect example over 31 billion was provided for antirecession programs between 1974 and 1975 during the recession at that time but because of delays in implementation 23 billion was not spent until after 1976 when we were not even in a recession that money caused inflation to skyrocket add that to the 26 billion thrown away in the public sector ceta program that we saw no benefits from and you wonder why we keep repeating the same mistakes since 1960 we have compiled a total deficit in every year but one of over 550 billion bringing the national debt to 1 109 trillion as of the end of august of this year and we are about to add more than 100 billion per year to that figure in each of the next few years when will we learn from our mistakes mr chairman when will we stop when will we learn anything because of previous bills this money is not needed even if it is it will not be spent well under any circumstances this bill has been born out of politics and it may well be passed and even enacted out of politics and it is sure to be spent politically but g6od politics does not always mean good sense and that could not be more true than in this instance even the washington post this very day says this is a tired old melody let us not play it again sam this is a political balloon but it will not lift anything other than the deficit and the political spirits of those who support it i urge my colleagues to shoot it down before it takes flight"],

somebody for contempt the grounds of the alleged citation are for another question entirely why do i say that well let me tell the members that if they want to vote to hold ms gorsuch in contempt on the basis of this document i hope that will pause to reflect on the fact that we are going to fall flat on our face because a court is going to throw us out i say that because the lawyer who assisted us in drafting this resolution failed to include one of the most fundamental and indispensible words that any citation of contempt must have to go anywhere in a court proceeding and that word is willful it is a jurisdictional fact we have not said that ms gorsuch willfully failed to do anything we have just said she failed to do something and you cannot hold anybody in contempt unless you charge them with willful disobedience of an act within the jurisdiction of the person asserting the authority second let me tell the members how a judge or a justice of an appellate court is going to look at this record when we correct this resolution after we fail the first time the court will say counsel do you mean to tell me that the congress refused to look at 786 977 documents the citee produced and yet is attempting to hold the citee in contempt for falling to produce 23 more get out of here commonsense dictates that congress must first examine what is produced then assert that such documents have been examined and the unproduced are needed to complete its investigative function i am in opposition to this resolution which would cite the epa administrator as being in contempt of congress while recognizing that this institution has an important constitutional role in overseeing the implementation of the laws it has passed a delineation has to be made between constructive oversight over as opposed to counterproductive meddling in the implementation of such laws as a member of the energy and commerce committee i have some familiarity with this issue in that our committees oversight and investigations subcommittee has also requested documents pertaining to superfundalbeit a more reasonable numberand has been similarly denied what is important to remember is that this dential of documents is not so much an exercise of executive privilege as it is a claim of separation of powers neither the administrator nor the administration is claiming that certain documents should never be turned over instead what they are claiming and what should be of concern to every member of this houseis that should not be required to prejudice enforcement efforts while they are still in progress the argument may be made that you can not have effective oversight unless congress can see what kinds of enforcement activities are going on but the other side of that coin is if we can look into all that is on while it is going on we become a participant in the process and that is not what the founding fathers had in mind it was their intention that the executive branch enforce the law not the legislative branch as legislators our duty is to decide what the law should be and then if it does not produce the intended results to change it accordingly but in this case we do not know if the law has produced the desired results indeed it has only been in effect for a year and a half and it still has 3 years to run also it should be remembered that epa is willing to turn over a vast ma jority of the documents requestedall but 300 to 400 pages out of an astounding total of 787 000 the pages being withheld go beyond the realm of summarizing actions taken or not taken rather they involve legal analysis and possible legal strategies that might be pursued in the prosecution of the case as a lawyer i can share with my colleagues the thought that premature disclosure of such analyses and potential strategies would be most helpful to those suspected of noncompliancethe very people that i suspect the authors of this resolution would not want to see helped now i realize that none of my colleagues would ever think of leaking such information if it became known to them but then again capitol hill leaks are not unheard of so i do not think that it is any more unreasonable for the executive branch to try and protect itself against the premature disclosure of prejudicial information than it is for the legislative branch to try and obtain information essential to the fulfillment of its constitutional responsibilities that being the case i think this body should be seeking an accommodation that would balance the respective interests of the legislative and executive branches of government rather than promote a confrontation between them one of the reasons i suggest this is that epa has gone a long way toward providing the requested material another is that epa was not given very much time to do it indeed it is my understanding that the epa only had 8 days to comply with this subpena not a very long period considering how long it has taken this congress to pass appropriations bills considering how difficult it has been for this congress to meet budget deadlines and considering how many other environmental matters have been shuffled under the rug by this congress just looking at the record and comparing it with what is being requested here and one could conceivably wonder if this is not a way to distract public attention away from what this congress has not been doing of course i realize that no member of this august body would stoop so low as to put politics above principle in such a fashionor in any fashion for that matterbut surely there are other matters just as much in need of attention or more in need of attention than this right now clean air legislation has been stalled for almost 2 years now to cite one example and i am reminded that clean water legislation which was submitted to the public works and transportation committee early last summer has yet to be reported in any form what an irony for the public to behold a 22page clean water proposal cannot be marked up in 6 months but 787 000 pages of documents covering 160 hazardous waste sites should be produced in toto without regard to the sensitive nature of the contents within 8 days if this is not a case of the pot calling the kettle black i am not sure what is the real question isdo we have the courage to admit as much to ourselves and the nation if not is it any wonder congress continues to rate so low in the public opinion polls one additional point needs to be made just because congress has been lax in cutting spending and getting the nations fiscal house in order it does not follow that that the executive branch should be held any less accountable two wrongs do not make a right hopefully the next congress will begin to get its act together just as the epa administrator in recent testimony before the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee has indicated that improvements should and have been made in epas internal operation however it is difficult for either congress or epa to make those improvements if a tremendous amount of time and resources are being expended in a questionable legal scrap which reminds me quite a fuss has been raised by environmentalists over cutbacks in epas budget the last year or two and yet here we have some"], [0.43958473205566406,

getting to approve each of them individually as we always have in the past this year they are coming up in one big lump sum now the reason that the majority has carried the rule that way is because they are anxious to save some of these committees that otherwise would be voted down individually and by putting them in a package carry the whole ball game forward what we need to do is to look forward to tomorrow because all america is looking to congress to cut expenses there is not a hometown in america but what tells congressmen we have too much government we have too much spending that inflation is killing them tomorrow we have an opportunity to take a step forward we have an opportunity to cut expenses to provide an example of frugality for every federal agency in this country the showdown vote is this on what was spent for committee staff funding last year will we cut it 10 percent we are going to get all kinds of terms talking about what they authorized last year it does not matter the question is what did committees spend last year we need to cut the total spending by 10 percent let me give you some figures that are indicative of the doubletalk that we can anticipate tomorrow the first thing that happens any time you have a funding resolution which cuts which they anticipate they just ask for a little more that way you can take a minimum cut and do not hurt yourselves so when all committees came in even after their trims socalled trims they asked for 47 million when they came out of the accounts subcommittee of the house administration committee they have cut that down to 42 8 million now 42 8 million what does that mean what it means is in addition to this 42 8 they already have 24 7 for statutory which is another way of getting the money they are now spending over 67 million for committees now how does that 67 million compare look at is this way the investigative committees in 1971 totaled 9 9 million in other words 9 9 million 10 years ago we were spending 9 9 million and now they are in asking for 40 million for investigative committee alone that means they are asking for four times as much being on the republican side of the aisle we realize that the big burden to reduce will come on the democratic side of the aisle because we have a tradition in the housethe democrats have established a traditionof taking a large proportion for themselves now in the other body it is the tradition that it is 2 to 1 last year when the democrats controlled it was 2 to 1 democrat this year when the senate is republican it is 2 to 1 republicans the ratio of the house staffs today is 5 5 to 15 5 to 1 for every republican staffer there are 5 5 democrats here so what we are going to ask is that the democrats outnumber the republican 4 to 1 we ask that they reduce the size of this overloaded bloated staff just to look at a few basic examples the first one that always comes to my mind is the district of columbia committee because you really ask yourself do we need a separate district of columbia committee it ought to be a subcommittee of government operations committee the other body gets by with just seven people on their staff but it takes 41 over here to handle the district of columbia issues we all know that the district of columbia now is a separate entity a separate government congress does not run it anymore we just simply have some oversight functions let me compare for you some figures which i think are very interesting because it shows how far congress has grown with these investigative committees i want to compare 1974 and what the democrats are recommending for 1981 on the banking committee it was 1 082 165 in 1974 now it is 2 457 600 on the foreign affairs committee it was 590 945 now it is 1 888 600nearly four times as much in 7 years on government operations it was 991 998 now it is 2 461 900all of this just during 7 years the energy and commerce committee was 903 271 and now it is 4 043 700 i serve on the commerce committee and i would like to say that we do not need 4 million a few years ago we had a staff of 58 now they say they need 170 they do not need all those people merchant marine had 245 692 nc they have 1 700 400 that is seven times as much for the merchant marine the rules committee back in 1973 and 1974 combined both years combined was 5 530 now they want 530 000 just for the year of 1981 science and technology was 400 777 now they want 1 896 800 the ways and means committee was 124 568 now it is 2 450 800 what is that about 20 times as much as you go down the line on all these committees you ask yourself this question how can we call for less spending by people on food stamps people who are handicapped people interested in education people interested in arts and humanities how can we ask them to make sacrifices unless we provide an example right here in this house where we should make real financial sacrifices so the showdown vote is coming tomorrow this vote tomorrow will be this are we going to take the expenses that we had last year and are we going to cut those expenses by 10 percent because a 10percent cut is a real cut will we cut the expenditures for committee staff by 10 percent when the issue comes to the floor tomorrow tomorrow we will see whether this house is serious about cutting waste in the federal government the committee investigative budgets will be considered in one omnibus resolution by the full house of representatives tomorrow we will be told by lieral democrats that we are cutting the budgets of the committees however it is important that no one be deceived by cuts which are not real the committees of the unitedstates house of representatives spent 39 971 551 in investigative expenditures in 1980 this amount was totally separate and in addition to the 24 million the committees were given in statutory funds there will not be any true cuts in committee spending until the committee authorizations are held below the nearly 40 million in investigative expenditures in 1980 it is important that we look at some specific examples of bloat that were included in those 1980 investigative expenditures these facts should make it clear to all that substantial cuts can be made from 1980 f apenditures my committee energy and ccm merce had almost three times the staff in 1980 that it had in 1973146 compared with 56 twentythree of these employees were paid over 40 000 per year the house adminis tration committee recommended 4 043 722 for the energy and commerce committee for 1981 this is almost 400 000 more than the committee spent in 1980 the ways and means committee spent 69 790 for investigative funding in 1973 six years later the expenditures were 25 times higher at 1 863 051 last year expenditures by the committees increased again it is difficult for me to believe that cuts in expenditures cannot be made from the ways and means committee which paid 11 of its investigative employees salaries of better than 40 000 per year in 1980 the rules committee spent 457 434 of its investigative budget in 1980 in 1973 the rules committee spend only 1 744 of its investigative budget the rules committees staff is six times as large as it was 6 years ago the merchant marine and fisheries committee is in a similar situation it spent seven times as much in 1980 for its investigative staff than it did just 7 years ago last year the investigative expenditures of the merchant marine and fisheries committee were more than double the expenditures of the armed services committee which has jurisidiction over a tremendous share of the federal budget these are just a few of the unnecessary expenditures that were made by certain house committees in 1980 let no one misunderstand which side of the aisle this waste exists eightyfive percent of the investigative staff positions are filled by democrats yet the democratic leadership has decided this year not to allow the full house to approve or disapprove of the budgets of each committee individually we will be forced to consider all of the budgets together frugal committees will be lumped together with wasteful committees members

glaring change that has oceurred in your lives over the last 7 or 8 years i would maintain that it is the dramatic increase in the price they have to pay for gasoline the price they have to pay for home heating oil and the price they have to pay for natural gas and all their energy products a study by the commerce committee last year found that 38 percent of inflation in 1979 can be attributed

that business that is a good way to conduct our countrys national security they say and now we are looking at iran and iraq we are deciding whether we should send aircraft and awacs to saudi arabia and libya is trying to get an atomic bomb to drop on israel we are deciding that the future of the strategic petroleum reserve is dependent on whether private investors decide to put any money into it what is the republican policy on energy in this country we are going to completely decontrol all energy prices for the big gas companies and big oil companies in this country what does that mean with these market forces those market forces are going to depress the amount of conservation existing in our country in 1975 18 percent of our profits in the manufacturing sector of the american economy went to the oil industry that was 18 percent in 1975 in 1980 it was 40 percent forty percent of all profits in the manufacturing of the american economy went to oil companies what does that mean well it means that every other corporation in the nonenergy sector of the american economy from automobiles on down has that many fewer dollars to go after in terms of their ability to invest in their own plants to give us the kind of reindustrialization that we need what else does it mean it means that the oil companies have so much extra money that they can go out and buy kennecott they can go out and buy amax and they can go out and buy montgomery ward just in recent times they have spent 15 billion now we are talking about tax cuts and we are talking about budget cuts here is 3 5 billion that

correct the beneficial impacts of the committee bill now seem to be secondiary considerations there are cases where multibilliondollar provisions have been added without hearings and i believe without much thought because someone believed they would gain a few votes the president however stands in the same mud the administration clearly opposes a large number of provisions that now appear in the

the air traffic controllers strike started that would reduce the traffic at national airport to 50 percent that would go very well in my district we could say let us reduce traffic to what it is today that would reduce the number of flights 25 percent which would go pretty well in my district of course that is not responsible but i submit to the members that the implementation of this policy will have little if any effect on the members of congress and it will certainly not as some of the opponents of the policy have suggested keep members from flying out of national as they do flow let me

second to suggest that the secretary of the department of transportation would take some kind of action that would bankrupt the airline industry of this nation is absurd the policy is not even yet final it will be subject to continuing review fine tuning to meet some of the obligations that we have bandied around today let me simply suggest that the level of commercial flights will remain exactly the same with some slight adjustment for major air carriers being offset by an increase in badly needed oommuter flights the noise limitation being proposed will not as some people claim cause undue hardship on the airlines or force them to abandon needed equipment the equipment proposed by this policy is already being developed by the airlines it will be in operation by 1986 whether or not

weigh carefully the provisions of the legislation and to make contributions to items which that member felt were not in the interests of the country by lumping not only appropriations but many authorizations into one omnibus piece of legislation we have removed that careful oversight even as a member of the conference committee i was unable to monitor all of the miniconference and private negotiations through which decisions were made several items in which i had a distinct personal interest were decided and included in the final legislation while i worked on the legislation for the subcommittee on which i serve legislating in this manner does not serve the people well this is the peoples branch of the government and i believe that the people we serve expect and deserve better than we are giving in house joint resolution 631 i compliment the chairman and ranking member for their hard work patience and dedication i respect them very much sadly i must oppose approval of this legislation after long consideration with a full understanding of the implications of defeating this bill and sending our committee back to the drafting stage i did not sign the conference report i wish that i had been able to sign and support the conference report because i know it was the result of much dedication and hard work on the part of all concerned but i declined to sign because i have serious reservations about key aspects of this legislation as it impacts on the national security of the united states so i rise in opposition to this bill i think that it will pass but my purpose in speaking and voting against this continuing resolution is to increase the awareness of my colleagues of the state of our legislative process and the ramifications of this legislation i speak out not in anger but in sadness to express my opposition to this continuing resolution in this single bill the congress has zeroed funding for the production of the only two landbased ballistic missiles proposed for deployment by this country since the d6tente era dawned the mx icmb and the pershing ii irbm these two programs are at the heart of our nations defense and negotiation strategy the national security of the united states depends upon a secure deterrent and a viable forward defense in europe with this bill in a single stroke we are severely undercutting the presidents national security policy and his ability to negotiate with the soviets at geneva following the house vote on the mx president reagan said i had hoped that most of the members in the house had awakened to the threat facing the united states that hope was apparently unfounded by action of this continuing resolution we have negated any incentive that the soviets may have had to negotiate an arms control agreement in good faith why should the soviets be interested in agreeing to reduce their arms if the united states is practicing what amounts to a large measure of unilateral disarmament let us face facts there is no way to obtain an arms control agreement that would serve the security interests of the united states that would enhance stability or preserve the peace if the soviet union sees that we are not going to take the minimal steps necessary to offset their enormous military buildup of the past decade i do not believe that any of us would want to see the united states attempt to negotiate with the soviets from a position of weakness unless this action is reversed we no longer will have any reason to continue with strategic arms reduction talks in geneva our allies also look to the actions of this congress as evidence of our national determinationor failure of willto respond to the severe and unprecedenteadrowth of the soviet military threat to peace the governments of our nato alles for the most part recognize the urgent need to modernize our defenses in europe indeed just this month the nato ministers issued a communique expressing their support for the modernization of unitedstates landbased strategic forces as essential to the security of western europe while reaffirming their commitment to pershing ii and glcm deployment but how are they to explain to their citizenry why they should support a new generation landbased missile in western europe if we refuse to support a new landbased missile in this country and how are they to explain the pressing need to modernize nato defenses when this congress decides to shutdown pershing production lines that were just started up last year the allies have emphasized the importance of the intermediate range force negotiations in geneva and the promise of those talks for eliminating the unstable balance of forces in europe the unitedstates position which nato has steadfastly supported is that we will desist from deploying pershing ii if the soviets will dismantle their vast ss20 force now targeted on our nato allies but his bill has eliminated production funds for pershing ii as a consequence the credibility of our negotiating position is called sharply into question in fact without an ongoing pershing production line i fear that the inf talks are doomed to fail it seems to me that to continue the negotiations without funding for pershing ii would be little more than an exercise in selfdelusion sadly i have reluctantly concluded that this country cannot expect to achieve worthwhile arms control agreements with the soviet union unless the flaws in this continuing resolution are rectified unless production funds for the mx and pershing ii are restored i believe that president reagan should consider telling our negotiators to stay out of the negotiations until congress repairs the damage to our position at geneva i am also dismayed by the broadstroke cuts we have taken in our defense and military assistance budgets this continuing resolution cuts our ability to meet our security assistance requirements by 700 million this cannot help but have a negative impact on this countrys ability to secure its interests in many parts of the world in particular i am concerned about our ability to secure access to needed facilities in the vital persian gulf region where countries which were to receive needed military assistance will now be shortchanged i hope that the most egregious shortfalls can be compensated through supplemental funding in defense by this bill we have cut the presidents request by almost 20 billion i fear that we have ignored president kennedys admonition when he said let us put an end to this policy of deciding our fiscal requirements and then trim ming our defenses to meet them let our dangers decide our defense requirementsand then fit our fiscal policies to meet them president reagans efforts to redress our serious defense deficiencies across the spectrum deserve more support from this congress than is reflected in this continuing resolution let me turn to an area of the legislation with which i had more direct responsibility that of foreign operations i the conferees agreed to provide a total of 11 2 billion for foreign assistance programs compared to the senate amount of 11 6 billion and the house amount of 11 billion the administrations request was 11 2 billion and the fiscal 1982 appropriation was 11 5 billion the conference agreement is 8 6 million below the president budget the conference report

foreign military credit sales 750 million of which is forgiven the total amount provided and the economic assistance portion are the same as the presidents request the amount of forgiven military credits is 250 million over the presidents request the senate had provided a total aid package for israel of 2 61 billion of which 910 million is economic assistance and 1 7 billion is foreign

billion in foreign military credit sales 425 million of which is forgiven the only change from the presidents budget is the addition of 25 million in military credit sales which are also forgiven the

authority of 9 billion a reduction of 220 million below 1982 the presidents request were 3 83 billion for direct loans and 8 biliecember 20 1982 co lion for guarantees the amounts in the conference

report by the aid administrator within 6 months on the practicality of such a provision the types of which meet these guidelines and the overall effect on aids operations by including this language

continuing resolution concerning the legal services corporation particularly i am concerned that the provision that requires that all of last years grantees and contractors be funded at the same level as last year until board members who have been confirmed by the senate can make funding decisions may be misinterpreted i would like to make clear my understanding as a conferee on the resolution that this language limits the board only in deciding upon levels of funding but in no way limits the boards authority to issue regulations policies or in other ways to require grantees and contractors to comply m ith board regulations and policies i am also concerned that this provision may be unconstitutional in that it purports to limit a constitutional power of the president to make recess

components of the presidents economic recovery tax plan were not in controversy because both houses of the congress passed virtually identical individual and business tax cut provisions for individuals there is a 3year 25percenit acrosstheboard cut followed by indexing in 1985 for businesses there is major depreciation reform as embodied in the accelerated cost recovery system beyond these two central provisions there were a number of important differences which the conferees resolved the conference report deletes the house provision which reduced the holding period for longterm capitalgain treatment to 6 months the holding period will stay at the current law level of 12 months the conferees accepted the other bodys date for lowering the capital gains rate to 20 percent this means sales occurring after june 9 will be eligible for the new and lower maximum rate on the provision to allow all taxpayers to deduct their charitable deductions there was a difference as to the phasein schedule the house bill provided a 100 contribution cap in 1984 whereas the other bodys version has no cap in 1984 the resolution in the conference report provides a 300 contribution cap in 1984 the only major difference in the accelerated cost recovery system concerned the actual writeoff r~ate for rerd property in the 15year recovery class the house bill provided for the use of the 200percent declining balance method whereas the other body provided for the use of the 150percent declining balance method the resolution was to provide for the use of the 175percent declining balance method for all real property except lowincome housing lowincome housing will be depreciated over 15 years using the 200percent declining balance method the conference report contains in some form all but two of the house provisions concerning the crude oil windfall profit tax the two deletions are the freezing of the depletion allowance at 22 percent and the credit for woodburning stoves three provisions are identical to the house bill they are the exemption of stripper oil extracted by independent producers the reduction of the windfall tax on new oil from 30 to 15 percent and a windfall profit tax exemption for residential child care agencies the royalty owner provision was modified royalty owners will receive a 2 500 windfall profit tax credit in 1981 in 1982 1983 and 1984 they will receive a 2barrelperday exemption from the tax in 1985 and thereafter the exemption will be 3 barrels per day the conference report contains a scaledback version of the dividend reinvestment provision

utility the provilsion sunsets after estate and gift tax provisions generally are the same as in the house bill one exception relates to a dollar limitation on the special use valuation of farm property the house bill allowed an adjustment of up to 1 000 000 in 1983 and thereafter the conference report includes a 750 000 special use valuation adjustment in 1983 and thereafter the conference report adopts the other bodys provision related to commodity tax straddles this version is tighter than the house bill thus effecting much greater revenue savings an estimated 1 7 billion by 1986 the tax credit for workrelated dependent care was changed from a 20percent credit regardless of income to a sliding scale tax credit beginning at 30 percent for families with incomes of 10 000 or less and gradually phasing down to 20 percent for families with incomes of 28 000 or more the maximum amount of dependent care expenses on which the credit may be claimed was increased from 2 000 annually for one dependent to 2 400 and from 4 000 annually for two or more dependents to 4 800 dependent care provided by an employer as a fringe benefit will not be considered to be taxable income to the employee the credit which is currently allowed on inhome care of older incapacitated dependents will be permitted on outofhome care as well the credit will be allowed on dependent care provided in centers with more than six dependents only if such centers comply with the state and local law these provisions relating to child and adult care constitute a major improvemernt in the current law the targeted jobs tax credit was extended to cover individuals hired before 1983 and expanded to include afdc recipients win registrants and employees laid off from ce ta public service employment vietnam veterans will be included regardless of age and cooperative education students will be included only if they come from lowincome families the program is tightened by requiring that after a transition period certifications that individuals meet the criteria for the credit will have to be requested or received before the employee begins working certifications will be invalid if requested after the employee was hired or if based on false information provided by the employee the futa wage limitation on firstyear wages eligible for the credit is eliminated i believe the compromises reached by the conferees are fair and reasonable all but the most technical possible details are within the scope of the conference this legislation marks a historic new direction in tax policy it not only gives

time for special orders this nation has not completed all of its social agenda by any stretch of the imagination there are those who seem to think that we have but one of the steps that we can take one of the steps that i hope before too long we will take is to guarantee all americans the right to have a job but unless you and i in this body start talking about that now come the time when there is an administration that is sympathetic to that goal we simply are not going to achieve that goal what we have passed is the humphreyhawkins act which was a step forward it was a declaration that we wanted to do something but we have honored that declaration with very little action right now we have 10 5 million unemployed americans this nation has the choice right now of either paying people for doing something or paying people for doing nothing because we are not going to let people starve and faced with that choice i think clearly we ought to say that we are going to pay people for doing something to achieve a program to move in that direction where we would say that to every american means that labor and management and government have to work together president reagan has said 1 percent unemployment costs the federal budget 25 billion there are various estimates on that i have read estimates as low as 19 billion i have read estimates as high as 30 billion let us assume the president is right we are talking about a very very costly thing when we have this very high unemployment what would it cost to guarantee every american a job i think the reality is that we could have such a program at perhaps no cost to the federal budget or if any a relatively small cost i will insert in the record at this point a footnote from a chapter in a book i have written called the once and future democrats in which i go into the costs there is a variety of ways of roughly calculating the costs because of the requirement that beneficiaries should be out of work at least thirty days approximately half of the eight million unemployed would not be eligible of the four million remaining some would find private employment rather than take the publicservice jobs some would draw benefits under tradebenefit laws or a restructured unemploymentcompensation law perhaps two million or at the most three million would take part at the peak of the wpa program three million out of a total of nine million unemployed participated assuming two million at a cost per job of 5 500 plus 2 000 per job for supervisory and administrative costs the total direct outlay would be 15 billion a rough estimate for budget purposes is that each 1 00 in federal expenditure returns 0 25 that would bring the cost down to 11 250 000 000 there would be some savings on welfare food stamps and unemployment compensation that could conservatively be figured at a 10percent savings bringing the cost to slightly more than 10 billion that equals roughly 5 billion per one million publicservice employees if instead of two million of the four million eligible there were three million who would be placed the cost at most would be 15 billion because with that high a percentage of participation other government welfare costs would experience a substantial drop two other ways of calculating are to use the ceta costs or the wpa costs of the early 1930s and add the inflation factor both of these nethods come out at a slightly lower figure though approximately the same when the economy is moving well the costs will be reduced the president should be given great flexibility in determining the desirable publicserviceemployment numbers a program that would stand rigidly at three million jobs in good times and in bad obviously does not make sense what those footnotes say is that at a point where we had 8percent unemployment which was what it was when i wrote that book the gross cost would be 15 billion for a program to guarantee a job to every american at a minimum wage level for 32 hours a week my reason for saying 32 hours a week is because that is what was done under the wpa that permits someone to work 4 days to go out and find employment in the private sector wherever possible incidentally the whole program is geared to encouraging privatesector employment but when you cannot find privatesector employment instead of telling people we will hand you a check for sitting hor e and doing nothing to have something productive for them to do the program also suggests that we guarantee this only for those who are out of work more than 30 days if the gross costs are 15 billion at 8 million unemployed since there is a kind of rule of thumb we used in the budget committee and in the budget process that there is a onefourth immediate return the immediate net cost is about 11 billion the savings in umemployment compensation welfare and all of the other programs would mean that there would be an appreciable savings below that even if there were no savings you are talking about a fraction of the increase we now have on the defense budget for example even if we took it all out of the gasoline tax you are talking about say a 10percent gasoline tax increase or a modest increase on cigarettes or alcohol or a host of other things that could guarantee a job for every american what is the cost also not only in dollar terms but in other ways from our failure to do this fundamental thing we pay a cost in crime whenever unemployment goes up crime goes up we pay a cost in battered children and battered spouses every time those unemployment statistics go up when these tragic statistics go up we pay a cost in human misery and pride in our cities the greatest thing tnat we could do for new york city or chicago or any city with major problems a city like east st louis ill would be to guarantee a job for every american the greatest thing you could do for areas of rural poverty like i have in southern illinois would be to guarantee a job for everyone what are the kinds of things they could be doing let me just close by touching on a few of these things incidentally the example for this is something that some of us remember i am 53 i can remember something called the wpa the public image was people who leaned on shovels but those people who leaned on shovels built schools libraries we had plays produced histories written we become a richer nation by turning the liability of unemployment into a national asset i think that is what we ought to be doing today what should we be doing let me just cite a few things very quickly we could be planting 200 million trees this year we have a hidden great liability in this country of illiteracy 10 to 25 million functionally illiterate adult americans we could have a massive assault on this thing that could raise the productivity of this nation we could build sidewalks i do not have a community in my district that does not need to improve sidewalks we could improve the culture of this country one of the things the wpa did was to have orchestras and all kinds of things like that we could have that on every public housing project we could have someone put a mosaic public housing projects do not need to be ugly things there is a host of things that could be done we could have hiking trails in our national forests we could be having transportation for senior citizens we could use the postal service right now under this ridiculous setup we have when you go from one town in my community to another town 13 miles away you go 5 stops 25 miles and it takes 3 days or so for the mail to get there we could have a few people taking that mail back and forth improving the postal service and improving the postal revenue we could have people working in subways to keep them clean and at the same time reducing crime we could have people working to insulate homes so that we use less energy and senior citizens and people of very limited incomes could have lower utility rates and the nation would save on energy i was in a town of mound city in my district in pulaski county where about 29 percent of the population is on welfare today i saw a number of buildings that need to be torn down why do we not take some of those people who are now out of work and put them to work tearing down those buildings the railroad beds of this nation need to be fixed up why should the nation that represents onethird of the worlds economy the most powerful industrial nation on the face of the earth be gradually drifting toward the worst railroad system of any industrial nation on the face of the earth we could have bike paths many of those who are out of work speak foreign languages we are the only nation on the face of the earth where you can go through grade school high school college get a ph d and never have a year of a foreign language why do we not use people who can speak foreign languages to teach our fellow americans spanish japanese chinese polish german you name it i have in my district rural cemeterles long neglected what if we fixed up there rural cemeteries i could go on and list another hundred things that need to be done what i am abking is that this house and our friends across the lobby in the other body start discussing and thinking now about moving toward guaranteeing all americans the right to a job i think that is the next big step forward this nation is going to take and the sooner we take it the finer this nation will be and i hope that i can be sitting in this body in not too many years when that takes place"], [4.5180320739746094e-05, 0.5000451803207397, 0, "i yield to the gentleman from missouri i understand that this amendment has been prompted by concern that some employees of the agriculture department inspectors general have been placed in physical dan~ger in the performance of their duties if these individuals have indeed been subject to threats of death or serious injury i suggest that the proper response is first to determine whether they should have engaged in the activities which put them in such a position and then if those actions are appropriate to protect those individuals when they perform these types of duties the proper solution is not to give these employees rna sive new law enforcement powers this amendment so badly carries out the purpose of the 10 act that if it were adopted the entire act and all the inspectors general offices it creates in my judgment would be held up to ridicule and would be subject to a great deal of criticism as a strong defender of the inspectors general as they are presently constituted i urge the members to resist this attempt to pervert their mission"], [4.953145980834961e-05, 0.49995046854019165, 0, "as a member of the subcommittee on crime i have heard extensive testimony about the problem of drugs in this country we have heard startling testimony concerning the profits that drug traffickers reap at the expense of our nations health for instance drug traffickers consider forfeited ball a cost of doing business it is not inconceivable that a drug trafficker will post ball of over a million dollars with full knowledge that it will be lost when he fails to appear for trial the phenomenal profits of the drug trade enable him to treat our criminal justice system with that kind of contempt the very clear answer to this problem is to strip these offenders of the profits that they have made during the course of their illegal conduct not only will that prevent the abuse of the ball system but it will prevent the reinvestment of those profits in the drug business h r 7140 is a bill which was reported out of the subcommittee on crime with my very enthusiastic support i am in original cosponsor of the bill because i believe it offers an innovative and fair solution to the problems generated by the substantial profits of drug trafficking h r 7140 contains various provisions which are designed to take the profits out of drug trafficking these include first a presumption similar to the one that operates in income tax cases which puts a limited burden on the defendant to show that his assets were not the proceeds of drug trafficking second a provision that land and buildings used to store controlled substances are forfeitable third a fund for drug law enforcement consisting of the proceeds realized by the government from forfeitures fdurth a large increase in the fines for drug trafficking current fines are totally unrealistic fifth protections for innocent third parties who may have an interest in property subject to forfeiture obviously the penalties imposed should not be at the expense of persons who were not involved in or aware of illegal activity i believe that h r 7140 is a commendable first step by this congress toward providing a substantial disincentive to drugrelated activi ty i am hopeful that this body will also pass other important crime measures which will have an adverse impact on drug trafficking such as reforms of our bail procedures i hope my colleagues will joing the gentleman from new jersey and myself in voting to suspend the rules and pass h r 7140 e"],

being employed for purposes of determining triggers on unemployment compensation at the state level we also add 50 million to eliminate the proposed 90day may 1981 waiting period for some poor soul who is aged and disabled and is trying to become eligible for ssi benefits and we try to restore 100 million on the emergency energy assistance program for persons who are going to have to pay grossly increased energy prices to heat their homes but for whom a sub stantial reduction in assistance is being recommended by the reagan administration we try to restore 10 million to protect those senior citizens between the ages of 62 and 65 who would lose the minimum benefit and would otherwise qualify for si but for the fact that they have not yet reached the age of now how do we get to a balanced budget we get to a balanced budget by first of all implementing some of the savings which i have mentioned here and further by making two additional adjustments no 1 we assume that there will be the tax cut recommended in the committee proposal both for businesses and for individuals but we assume that we will do exactly what president kennedy did we simply assume that the productivity building business tax cuts will be passed first we assume that we will also vote on individual tax cuts but that we will delay their implementation until january 1983 the second thing we do is to suggest that we ought to for instance reduce the benefits which your truly needy ma and pa oil companies of the world are getting under the oil depletion allowance we are suggesting that we limit that subsidy to the same per barrel subsidy that those oil companies were receiving when the last adjustment was made in the oil depletion allowance before deregulated oil prices expanded by a factor of five the amount of the subsidy which those oil companies get on every barrel under the depletion program we also provide since we are cutting food stamps which have a per meal subsidy of about 43 cents and since we are going after the doubledipping third graders who are eligible not only for the school lunch program but also for food stamp programs we are suggesting that if we are going after those kids we ought to also go after the tax deductible business lunch why should we provide for those kinds of reduced programs i have just mentioned but then not lay a glove on the 9 20 subsidy that occurs on a 20 business lunch why should we not say to a businessman you can travel first class if you want and you can continue to have your business costs deducted but on air travel we will only allow you to deduct the coach class equivalent you are not going to be able to ask uncle s4am to foot the bill for firstclass service as well we also suggest that we eliminatb the tax exemption for corporations doing business in american possessions most especially puerto rico this gives us a balanced budget i do not want to take a lot of time explaining the reasons for offering it i do not believe that balanced budgets are appropriate in all economic conditions but based oni what we have seen over the last 2 years i do believe that it is appropriate to try to reach a balanced budget this year henry kaufman has made quite clear his concern and i know very few people more respiected he has made clear his concern that if we do not have a balanced budget if we do not delay those individual income taxes we are going to have t1he kind of signals going out to the money markets which are going to force the high interekt rates in this country that will kill off housing kill off the ability of kids

imported meat the concern i have with the proposed amendment by the gentleman from south dakota is that i do not really believe it accomplishes what we need to accomplish most imported meat is served in fast food chain restaurants the amendment by the gentleman from south dakota makes no such provision for that meat i think it is much more important that that meat be identified than it is the meat that may be placed in cans here in the united states it would seem to me that the proper thing to do is to hold hearings in the agriculture committee at least i have the indication that we will be able to do that on a meat labeling bill i think we should have a strong meat labeling bill that does as the gentleman indicates and really gives some protection to the consumer so that he knows whether or not he is buying imported meat particularly since it is a lower quality generally than domestic meat it seems to me that the gentlemans amendment is the amendment we should support and certainly i would work with the gentleman from south dakota and i think many other members of the committee would i do not happen to agree with the gentleman that it is an impossibility to get such
