stop and think about and understand what they are about to do regardless of all the reasons the expedient reasons they are going to hear about why we ought to be doing what we are going to do regardless of what our leaders are going to tell us and have told us they know this is a serious extraordinary most unusual procedure they know there are problems with it regardless of what they may tell us about why we need to take this action there are several reasons why i think many of you might decide you want to vote for this motion let us explore them tne first one and the most obvious the one you are going to have to answer to your constituents for is the fact that what you essentially saying when you vote to bypass the normal procedures of this body and send a bill straight to conference is that you think that bill is perfect it is so perfect that no committee in the house need look at it no member need offer an amendment no hearings need to be held no examination need be given and no vote need be taken as a matter of fact the bill is not even in print no member need even read it because you cannot so just send it to conference because you think the bill is that good maybe you want to answer for that to the american people i do not i do not think that is a good reason the second one is the fact that i hear in good conscience from my colleagues who say this is the only way we are going to get a tax bill we have been writing tax bills in this congress for 194 years and have never done this before how can you say this is the only rvay to write a tax bill when we never had 1 day nay not 1 hour of an attempted markup to write one how can we claim we failed and it cannot be done when we never tried my colleagues if we cannot write a billand i have confidence in my colleagues on the ways and means committee on both sides of the aisleif we cannot write one we can always come back with this extraordinary proce dure a week or two from now the third reason one that i think is one that i do not like to bring up but i think it is there on both sides of the aisle that is political expediency my colleagues on the democratic side are willing to cast aside their constitutional responsibilities to make this a republican bill and have no democratic footprints or fingerprints on it my colleagues r a the republican side of the aisle are willing to sacrifice their responsibillies for the political expediency of a popular president of our party i do not think either one of those are very good reasons as a matter of fact none of these reasons are very good and the american people expect us to do our job not play partisan politics not submit to something that is far for perfect and we know it none of these reasons my col leagues are good and we know it none of them are good the bill is not perfect partisan poll tics is not something we should be tol erating on something so serious as this i ask you to just listen for a minute and consider what you are about to do i believe very strongly we are violating the constitution article i section 7 it is very simple one line all bills raising revenues should originate in the house of representatives i repeat all bills raising revenues shall originate in the house of representatives there has never been one case in the history of the federal courts in this country that have ever held a revenue bill can originate in the senate we had a precedent cited by our chairman a moment ago a very minor thing and the courts have held in inconsequential things such as that precedent the courts will look the other way nobody my colleagues nobody believes that this bill that came from the other body is inconsequential that it is minor it has been labeled the greatest the largest tax revenueraising bill in the history of this country my colleagues saw how thick it was a moment ago although it is not even in print yet there were hundreds of pages and i have been told over 100 tax changes that significantly change the tax code that you have not read nor have i nor has anybody on this house floor nor will we be given the opportunity i might add for partisan politics for political expediency for a reason that does not hold water we are saying cast aside the constitution and let us move on never in the 194year history of this house have we done this never before have we allowed the other body to write a major tax bill and send it to us and we just docilely send it back to them and go to conference never before we should not now as there is no reason to do so and good reasons not to"],

know it is amazing to me to sit here and hear about this project that i have been listening to testimony on for years i do not believe anybody here that is in this congress has heard more testimony other than my good friend the dean of the house the gentleman from mississippi m we have had 2 000 people before our committee but i hear more things when this bill comes up on the floor that i never heard before we have over 200 projects in this appropriation bill and every single one of them probably has some opposition when this project is finished and you are going to finisif it you are not going to stop a project this practically finished i will guarantee that you are going to see the same type of opposition on other brojects they will target another project for deletion last year i pointed out that by accident i got hold of this publication i am holding up it tells me what is going to happen before it happens before i come to the floor i know what is going to happen its says here strategy how to kill the tenmtom i tried last year to find out who publishes this document there is no signature but i will tell you there is some very sophisticated material in this publication it tells you about a visit it is probably worth a hundred letters you got to your congressman and let him know that you are against the tenntom this first time in all these years i ever heard the cost of this project somebody said 3 billion i nearly fainted it never has been over 1 78 bilion that is just all there is to it you cannot make anything else of it but in here they say it is going to cost 3 billion three billion dollars that is a big difference but that is the only place i ever hear it we never hear it before the committee and i never heard it anywhere except in here when this bill comes up but i want you to listen now you listen a minute and see if this rings a bell with you it says here the most effective way to get in touch with your congressman dont go to washington because then you would be lobbying he would look at you you know and he would know you done bought a ticket to come up here and he would think you are lobbying somebody you get an appoint moent with him in his office back in his district and you go in there and you look at the congressional almanac before you go and pick out some votes that you like so you can brag on him you go in there and make him feel good you brag on him and tell him how much you appreciate that vote the way he voted on such and such a bill and then you pop it to him you say now listen i am against the tombigbee now this is not up here in your section of the country all you have got to do is just be for it i want your commitment you know that is way down there that is a boondoggle they have never seen it of course they do not know anything about it but they call it a boondoggle now this has been going on starting last year and this is the second year of it the same old thing these people that are opposing this project not one of them not one of them have come before our committee to give us the benefit of their knowledge they have not told us anything i invited my good friends congressman pritchard and congressman edgar to go down and see this project we have nothing to hide about this project i invited them to go down and i appreciated them going down and seeing it they looked at it and they were briefed by the corps of engineers the people who are building this project the corps are profespional engineers and they would be working somewhere else if they were not here working on the tennesseetombigbee they are professional engineers and we rely on them for technical information i am glad we do not rely on what we hear on this floor become we would be in trouble it would be a terrible water project when we got through with it if we relied on what we hear here the corps said the total cost of the projectis 1 78 billion no one raised a question about it nobody questioned that figure the gao in its recent study discussed coal shipments my good friend from washington congressman pritchard has been told that they cannot use this highsulfur coal from that area down there in foreign countries i will tell my colleagues right now if they will go down there they will see barges of coal six barges together south of demopolis just where they have been for the past 65 years traveling that part of the river and they say it is not navigable and they cannot turn the curves it is a crooked river but it is not so crooked that six barges cannot go down it and have been going down it tied togethereight could but they use six and it has been that way for 65 years there is no authorization and no one is even thinking of building a project south of demopolis let me finish by saying that from my home county coal is going down the tombigbee down the warrior river to demopolis and on down to mobile and being hauled from there into seagoing vessels to japan and all over the world so if the gentleman will he needs to tell the people in japan that have been using that coal for 10 years and they are buying millions of tons what does the gao say about the coal the gao in its recent study was asked and i picked this up because my colleagues have been quoting and finding things in here and they indicate that it says to stop the project there is not anybody that knows anything about that project that ever said to stop it nobody would recommend that the court would not recommend it the court specifically said it would be a mistake to stop the whole project the gao in its recent study was asked to determine whether the coal reserves were available to meet projected shipments over the 50year life of the tenntorn the gao finding and here i am quoting them found an estimated 58 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves are located in those states adjacent to the inland waterway systems with a potential for movement on the tenntom this amount is 48 times the coal estimated to move on tenstom during its 50year economic life the corps of engineers has consistently for 200 years been conservative in their estimates we have checked them out and the benefits have always been more than the corps has estimated someone mentioned that a million dollars is going for a study down south of demopolis of course this is in the report and all they have to do is look and see what is in here do not make it sound like we are trying to start another project we are not there are some locks down there they have been there for 65 years the oliver lock is going to have to be replaced one day this money is to study these old locks one of these days they are going to have to have 0 some repairs on them and some work done on them there is no new project that we are talking about south of demopolis we have all of these smoke screens and i cannot answer all of them i do not have that much time j3ut my colleagues have heard what mr brock said about the coal that we need to be moving on the tenntom we need to ship that coal overseas and more is going to be going overseas the corps said 70 percent of the freight on the tenntom will be coal my colleagues know the important role that coal is playing now some members have said that members of the cabinet are against the tenntom my colleagues heard what mr brock has said he is very much in favor of it the president is for it and the last six presidents were for it there are other projects in there that cost just as much as the tenntom there is not a state in this nation that does not receive money through the projects funded in this appropriation bill every one of the 50 states is receiving money so let us not throw up all of these smoke screens i have never seen such a phony attack as is made on this tennesseetombigbee project this project has been studied more than any project not just any project in the united states but any project in the world it has met every test the l n railroad started this opposition with 15 000 this is where the ball started rolling they do not have their name on this but they put 15 000 into it to start this opposition when the project started they have been to the unitedstates supreme court twice and the supreme court of the united states says you have not got a case they have been in the federal court this is the sixth decision last week which really affirms the strength of this project there actually have been six federal court decisions and twice the unitedstates supreme court said no said the lower courts have handled it right this was on the environmental question on economic feasibility on every kind of question that could be raised and they have raised it so i urge my colleague to vote against this pritchard amendment if my colleagues approve this pritchard amendment they are going to have an area out there that looks like the worst tornado that ever hit any part of the united states i asked one of the engineers yesterday what would happen if we did not get the funding for the project and just stopped it like one or two are advocating here he said well the first thing is that you would have to have people out there to pump the water to dewater the locks and dams there are still six locks and dams in different stages of completion he said if we did not they would just push them up out of the ground talk about a disaster

bipartisan and noncontroversial bill and i am pleased to join with my colleagues in supporting its passage i first want to commend the members who have worked on this bill i think we have dealt with this bill in a responsible manner we have given our seabed mining companies what they need an interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my remarks in short i believe the bill before us meets the foreign policy and national security interests of this country

rapid pace of the nuclear arms race if we are truly serious about strengthening our defense capability we will today put an end to this kind of wasteful unjustified expenditure the proposed mx missile program represents nothing more than a tremendous diversion of critical resources away from areas of genuine need both within and outside of the defense budget study after study has concluded that our most pressing military need is not the purchase of increasingly costly and sophisticated nuclear weaponry rather our needs are in the conventional forces areain the improvement of the morale and competence of our personnel in the provision and maintenance of our basic equipment in the adequacy of basic logistical support yet as the country gears up for a massive nuclear buildup it is these elements of our military preparednesselements essential to real national securitythat are by and large ignored perhaps the greatest absurdity of the mx is that it is proposed as a means of enhancing american deterrence when our nuclear forces already provide a tremendously powerful counterthrect to soviet aggression to put the issue of our nuclear deterrent in perspective it should be noted that even if the soviet union launched a first strike against the united statesa strike that was so extraordinarily successful that it totally eliminated our landbased nuclear force our airborne nuclear fleet and all the nuclear submarines that are in port at any one timethere would remain at sea 20 nuclear submarines each carrying 16 missiles each missile carrying 8 to 10 warheads each warhead having an explosive power seven times that of the bomb that fell on hiroshima these 20 subs alone would be sufficient to destroy every major economic industrial and population center in the soviet union three times over in terms of accuracy size and survivability the unitedstates nuclear force is more than sufficient to deter soviet aggression and in the absence of any operable agreement on strategic arms limitation the decision to develop even greater nuclear capability will only fuel the already growing threat of a major and destabilizing arms race but these are military arguments that have been addressed and addressed effectively by those who have proceeded me i think what really requires discussion at this point are the broader implications of the approach that we appear to be taking to national defense issuesan approach that is symbolized by the mx missile debate what is happening is thatout of a sense of fear unsupported by evidence or reasonwe are indiscriminantly

defense program being promoted by the administration over the next 5 years the united states will spend over 1 6 trillion on defense 1 6 trillion if we were to spend that sum at the rate of 1 million per day 365 days a year it would take over 4 000 years to exhaust the war chest put another way over the course of the next 5 years we will be spending on the average 830 million a day on defense alone the economic implications of the defense buildup are staggering last fall the pentagon asked such luminaries as the nobel laureate lawrence klein otto eckstein and michael evans along with forecasting firms such as chase econometrics and merrill lynch economics to examine the impacts of rising military spending their conclusion large increases in the military budget will lead to greater deficit spending and with tax reductions exceeding cuts in social spending the defense increases will push the federal budget even further into the redmeaning continuing high interest rates and continuing high rates of inflation but that is only part of the economic cost of wasteful and excessive military spending economists are also warning us that our defense spending binge by diverting scarce capital and technical expertise away from other sectors of our economy threatens directly our efforts to revitalize our private industrial base we are all keenly aware of the tremendous difficulties the united states has encounteredin recent years in the competition with the germans and japanese and the explanation for our difficulties is traceable directly to their relatively greater commitment of capital to the private sectors of their economies over the past decade american fixed capital investment as a percentage of our nations gross national product ranged between 17 percent and 19 percent during the same period german fixed capital investment was between 20 percent and 26 percent of gnp and japanese fixed capital investment was in the 31 percent to 36 percent range is it any wonder that modem and efficient japanese and german firms have been able to overtake the aging american industrial system for emphasis it should be noted that in 1977 for every 100 of new fixed capital formation the united states applied 46 to the military sector in sharp contrast in japan only 3 70 of every 100 of new fixed capital formation was applied to the military this concentration of japans capital on productive economic growth goes far to explain the current success of that countrys industry where productivity grew 6 2 percent in 1980 by contrast aging plants and equipment in the united states led to a decrease in the average output per person in manufacturing industries of 0 5 percent the important point in the context of the legislation before us is that this economic disparity will only widen if we fal to bring defense spending under control and if we fail to recognize the overall economic impact of wasteful defense expenditures as economist bruce russett has noted every dollar in military spending results in a new loss of over 27 cents in fixed investment in civilian goods and a drop in personal consumption of 42 cents interest sensitive sectors like housing and durable goods cars appliances and furniture are especially hard hit when excessive arms spending bids up the cost of borrowing this loss of investment and consumption to the military decreases longterm growth opportunities making job creation difficult and preventing any growth in real wages if in the process of arming america we allow our countrys economy to decay i submit that we will have only weakened our nations security clearly the question before us today is not whether we can afford both guns and butter we can and must afford both but what we cannot afford is waste and extravagancebe that in domestic or in military programs and we must recognize that our national security is as dependent upon our economic strength as it is upon the number of missiles in our nuclear arsenal this is the real meaning of the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york it offers us an opportunity to pare back the kind of wasteful military expenditures that have no real military utility and are so economically destructive i commend mr addabbo for his effort and urge the adoption of his amendment"], [0.00022298097610473633, 0.5002229809761047, 0, "the democratic caucus is once again making a mockery of its party label by proposing undemocratic house rules that would undermine majority house rule the new restrictions on amendments to appropriations bills would make a sows ear out of the congressional power of the purse by depriving members of all political persuasions of what is sometimes the only means for curbing specific government actions the twothirds signature requirement for discharging a constitutional amendment turns majority rule on its head by permitting a small minority to block consideration of changes in our governments most basic and vital document postponement of votes on the journal and elimination of votes on consideration of bills would make it possible to go through a large portion of legislative business with the constitutionally required majority quorum not even in town this is simply a continuation of the phantom legislating already permitted in committees by the onethird quorum and proxy voting rules the automatic removal of members from committees by caucus action ignores the lessons of history which gave rise to the rule requiring election of committees members by the house rather than their arbitrary appointment and removal at the whim of a party leader or caucus election to and removal from a committee by the house safeguards against such abuse the proposed undemocratic caucus rules

disastrous trucking provisions of the surface transportation actand i must say that i agree with them 100 percent let me say that i do support the concept of this bill i agree we do need to rebuild and rehabilitate our nations highway system but i do not believe that we can single out one of the most important industries in the country and tax them to death which is what this bill would do all of the truckers i have met with support the 5cent increase in the price they pay for their diesel fuel in fact many have stated that they would support moderate increases in the miscellaneous taxes on truckers but a 163percent increase in taxes on a typical tractor trailer truck is totally unacceptable heavy use taxes would be increased from 210 to 1 880 one of the truckers i met with today gave me figures that should shock everybody this companys present tax and user costs are 81 200 per year this bill would increase his costs by 212 percent to 253 097 this is a phenomenal increase in taxes and fees for a single year i want to join the truckers in asking who will pay for these extra costs the consumers may pay but during a time of deregulation competition has increased and prices have fallen in the trucking industry it would be difficult to raise prices or increase trucking fleets the more likely scenario is that many of the smaller independent firms will fold adding to our unemployment problemwhile the larger firms will show substantial losses in their attempt to absorb the increased costs i urge my colleagues to support the truckers and the thousands of jobs at stake by defeating this rule let us pass a bill that will rebuild our roads without running over the truckers in the process e"], [0.00031819939613342285, 0.4996818006038666, 1, "on november 22 1981 during the debate on

than the amouht intended to be provided in house joint resolution 357 i have asked the gentleman from massachusetts whether the employment levels now intended to be funded under those accounts are the same the very able gentleman from massachusetts has informed me that the numbers of fulltime equivalent employees that i noted on november 22 for the medical care and medical administration and miscellaneous operating expense accounts are the numbers for which appropriations are intended to be made by the pending resolution as amended he has also indicated to me that with respect to the medical care account those numbers do not include the socalled common services adjustment fees i would also note that the amount being appropriated for the medical and prosthetic research account under the pending measure is somewhat more than was intended to be appropriated by house joint resolution 357 for that account i inquired of the gentleman from massachusetts whether the research
