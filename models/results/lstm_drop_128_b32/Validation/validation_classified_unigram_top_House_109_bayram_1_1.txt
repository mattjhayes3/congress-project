trucks through muddy fields it was the type of activity that appealed to this funloving girl little did ashton know that these two scoundrels had no plans to go mudding with her their sinister intentions were not revealed until it was too late for her to escape they took ashton to a dark deserted construction site away from the security of sugar land texas away from those who loved her away from the safety of her home and they executed her gangland style no reason no argument no justification just what one murderer called a morbid curiosity to see what would happen to see what she looked like when we shot her in the back of the head these two teenage terrors feeling no remorse or human compassion left ashton to die there in the heap of garbage while they went over to ihop for

certainly pleased that this legislation that we introduced passed the senate unanimously i fully expect something similar here in the house this bill and i just want to point out to my colleagues we are not revoting h r 810 we are talking about the bill to ban the procedure called fetal farming and we are taking up the senate version of the bill which is a verbatim equivalent to the bill that mr deal and i introduced this bill sets a very very important ethical boundary for biomedical research in this country and obviously there is an ethical boundary that today we all agree on it is a modest but important update to the waxman 1993 fetal tissue research prohibitions these laws as developed in the 1990s attempt to protect women from being coerced into having an abortion for the purpose of providing fetal tissue for research what they were trying to do is say you can only use voluntarily aborted fetal tissue then as now the concern was that women would be exploited because of this in my bill the researchers are held accountable not any woman who may be engaged in this procedure my bill adds a simple provision that would hold researchers criminally liable for intentionally implanting a human embryo either in a womb or in an animal womb for the purpose of harvesting the tissue for research otherwise the waxman language is the same it stays the same the criminal penalties are the same the definition of the fetus is the same when congressman waxman originally developed these laws the thought of fetus farming hadnt even crossed our minds even now most of us and most scientists would say that fetus farming is unthinkable science magazine in their reporting on the bill stated this bill the one we are debating now not h r 810 that fetus farming was ethically taboo for any legitimate researcher however what i want to get into now and that is the reason i have the posters this is the reason i have introduced this legislation it may be considered taboo now but i dont know if it will still be considered taboo in 2 or 3 or 4 years and the way these things usually progress is they start doing it in animals and it shows a little bit of maybe potential and then people start saying we can cure diabetes and parkinsons disease if we just start doing this in humans and that is the direction they want to go now this was the first study that caught my attention and as i have stated many times on the floor of this chamber i am a physician i still see patients once a month i have treated diabetes and parkinsons my uncle died of complications of parkinsons my father died of complications of diabetes i have dealt with this as a professional i have dealt with this in my family what they did is this is a cow study and i would be happy to provide this to anybody they did cloning but then they took the cloned embryos put them in a cow and cardiac and skeletal tissue from 5 to 6weekold cloned natural fetuses were used in this study and they tried to show that it had some therapeutic potential this was a second one a cow study where they did the exact same thing cloning and they put it in a cow and they grew it into the fetal stage and that is because embryonic stem cells are really a hassle to work with it is really easier to use fetal tissue and that is one of the arguments i have been making ever since i introduced my original bill to ban human cloning if you dont think scientists want to start doing this here it is this is one of the researchers involved with this he says we hope to use this technology in the future to treat patients with diverse diseases and that is usually the way we go we say oh this is ethically taboo oh we dont want to do this and then somebody with a ph d on the end of their name comes along and says we are going to be able to cure this and cure that even though there is very little evidence scientifically to say that the cures will be there or at least like in the case of human embryonic stem cell research most credible researchers in moments of honesty will acknowledge it is 10 to 20 years if ever going to be applicable but that is what they will do they will say we are going to cure this we are going to cure that so i am very grateful the senate voted unanimously i fully expect this bill to pass overwhelmingly on suspension and we will draw a line in the sand to say we are not going to take this whole area of tissue therapies into the realm of where we are exploiting fetuses today there is a majority in both bodies that want to exploit embryos but we are saying collectively as a nation

money overseas and domestically and provides service to over 40 countries in latin america asia africa and europe including the philippines mexico and australia irnet significantly decreases the costs

productive part of our society this bill is arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation congress addresses each year chairman regula understands this responsibility he understands that this is the peoples bill and he has worked hard to distribute the limited resources he was given in a fair and conscientious way so my no vote today should in no way be seen as a lack of respect or appreciation for the efforts of ralph regula the chairman of the labor hhs appropriations subcommittee chairman regula and the staff of the subcommittee have worked within this tight budget allocation to address the needs and priorities of our states and communities as best they could under the circumstances for example the conference report includes increases in two critical areas to help infants and their families the first is the centers for disease control and preventions folic acid national education program this program has been instrumental in the prevention of birth defects by encouraging women of childbearing age to take the recommended amount of folic acid daily thereby decreasing the rate of neural tube defects the second increase is for the health resources and services administrations newborn screening program for early identification of infants affected by certain genetic metabolic hormonal and or functional conditions for which there are effective treatment or intervention in addition for the first time this bill also includes programmatic funding for the national media campaign to fight underage drinking which is being conducted by the ad council i thank the committee for helping our country make progress in these critical public health areas the presence of these and a small number of other positive programmatic funding levels however is simply not enough to warrant approving this conference report the constraints placed on this bill by the budget priorities and decisions of the republican leadership are not worthy of this house and the values of the american people i voted against the house bill when it came to the floor in june precisely because it fell soshort of meeting the needs of americas children families and the most vulnerable among us i had hoped that the bill would be improved in the conference it is unfortunate however that in this conference agreement the way they chose to improve overall programmatic funding from the original house bill levels was to take resources away from other priorities and community needs this report and its funding decisions do not stand in isolation they reflect the misguided priorities of a republican leadership that has continually put the interests of the wealthy and the privileged before the needs and priorities of working and middleclass americans this laborhhseducation conference report is a direct result of an economic agenda of tax cuts for the wealthiest americans and it weakens americas future by underfunding key education health and human services programs if approved this bill will impose cuts to essential programs important to americans in at least three major areas first this conference agreement significantly shortchanges our nations workers the bill cuts labor programs 430 million below the fy 2005 levels training and employment services for the 7 4 million americans who are unemployed are funded well below the fy05 levels this includes a 31 million cut to adult training grants a 36 million cut to youth training grants and a 141 million cut to unemployment insurance offices the unitedstates employment service office which matches job seekers with job openings is slashed by 10 5 percent and the report freezes funding for dislocated and older workers in addition the bill slices international labor affairs the program that helps eradicate abusive child labor practices and protect worker rights by 21 percent secondly this report is simply a reaffirmation of the administrations hollow commitment to education slashing the no child left behind funds by 784 million below the fy 2005 level it cuts the education technology block grant program that provides access to technology in schools by a shocking 45 percent from last years level it reduces the even start program supporting services for low literate and lowincome families by 56 percent and as a final point it shortchanges our children with disabilities by funding idea at 4 billion below the republican promise to put special education on a fast track to full funding finally the report is particularly devastating to the health of americans some of its most significant cuts are directed towards the critical programs that provide a health care safety net for the uninsured the conference agreement provides 34 million less than the house passed bill and 89 million less than the senate bill for grants to health centers for services to the uninsured the maternal and child health block grant is cut by 3 percent reducing its true per capita purchasing power by almost 20 percent below the fy 002 level the conference agreement terminates the healthy communities access program that makes grants to local hospitals health centers and providers so that they can provide better integrated systems of care for the underinsured and uninsured lastly as if cutting services wasnt enough the conference agreement virtually decimates the title vii health professions training programs cutting overall funding from 300 million in fy 2005 to 94 million in fy 2006 these drastic reductions to critical programs are not necessary ranking member david obey has consistently laid out a commonsense approach to this problem by simply reducing the tax break for those with incomes greater than 1 million we could add funding for no child left behind programs maintain college affordability by increasing the money for pell grants shore up our health safety net programs and rebuild our public health system to respond to pandemics and possible terrorist attacks but these

extension of oversight and accountability related to united states reconstruction funds aid efforts in iraq by extending the termination date of the office of special inspector general for iraq reconstruction let me just say to my colleagues that to some degree this is what i categorize in my liumble experience as a representative and a member of this body as one of those thinair issues this was an issue which was created out of thin air by a press corps which i guess was under a direction to come up with some issues immediately before the last election this goes to the expiration of the inspector general for the reconstruction money being spent in iraq and the initial formulation was that after 80 percent of that reconstruction money had been spent that the time for the inspector general before he handed it off handed off his duties back to the department of defense inspector general who oversees such funds also would extend 10 months after 80 percent of that money had been spent now as we were putting the defense bill together and you had a story that came out of one of the nations newspapers i think it was the new york times that said that somehow somebody had inserted a provision in this 4efense bill that they said that at the last minute and in the dark of night that would somehow cut off the inspector general and his oversight responsibilities and let me just say that is not the case and i have now learned why we have signature sheets on each provision of the defense bill as it is put together where you have a signoff by the democrats and republicans on each and every provision in august a month before we finished the defense bill hardly the last minute we inserted what i call a handoff provision and it simply said instead of saying 10 months after 80 percent is spent and since in november we had spent already about 75 percent we almost hit the threshold we figured that that meant that 10 months after that was around october 31 of next year so we put a date certain that is october 31 in the bill as the handoff date from the inspector general the special inspector general to the department of defense ig so we wanted to have a date certain at that time and this was done in a very ministerial fashion representatives from the democrat side and the republican side in the conference for the other body and for ourselves four signatures count them four were attendant to this particular provision so it wasnt done in the dark of night and it wasnt done at the last minute it was done in the total open after careful review by all parties and it simply gave us a date certain for the time that we thought was about the time that would be 10 months after 80 percent of the funds were spent now after a flurry in the press we got a member from the other body who said i knew nothing about this we highly suggest that that member read the bill as it was being put together she said my staff may have known but i didnt perhaps the staff of that particular member and she should communicate so that she knows what they are signing but this is a very ministerial thing there was no motivation to try to extend or try to cut off the ig it was simply assigning a date certain for the handoff from the special ig to the dod ig now you may ask well in that case why are you supporting this well i am supporting it for a couple reasons one i dont care if we extend the inspector general the special inspector general although i will object if we end up keeping that team in place after all the money has been spent and there is nothing for them to do although that may give rise to another new york times story but i think it is fine if they want to have another date certain and if they want to include additional reconstruction money which this provision does that is additional 2006 money that goes to reconstruction that is fine also so this is one of those thinair issues that needs to be put to rest i reserve the balance of my time"],

and exercise but even more importantly is the responsibility that they have to give a good example and instructioi to their children i think it is probably the worst form of child abuse to let these youngsters that at a very early age overeat and become obese you have talked about the issue of poor mental image selfimage and of course i also see you talked about hollywood and of course this issue of there is no such thing as mental illness i think probably they might predominate in some of those diseases which we categorize as mental illness but quite honestly when a child goes to school and there is this emphasis on thinness and you see these youngsters wearing these britney spears jeans and that sort of thing a child even a little bit overweight and certainly one that is significantly obese of course they are going to have a poor image of themselves they are going to withdraw and they are going to become shy it is very likely they are going to be picked on how in the world can they grow and develop with a healthy selfimage no wonder they end up needing to be counseled and treated by the gentleman from pennsylvania and other mental health care specialists yes unfortunately some even go on to harm themselves and possibly even commit suicide so i guess the most important thing that i would want to say as a physician member is that we need to prevent this we need to make sure that parents get the message that they have an obligation not just to take care of themselves but first and foremost to take care of these precious children that they bring into the world it is their responsibility to make sure that they are from the very beginning when they start eating at the table to make sure that they are healthy and stay healthy so you do not have to have them ending up in your office treating them for not only mental illness but also the many complications of obesity you mentioned them you mentioned diabetes high blood pressure so many things and talk about the cost to this health care system of ours we always talk about waste fraud and abuse in the medicare and the medicaid programs and wanting to eliminate that and we are very diligent and will continue to be so but this is almost a nobrainer it is like we heard former speaker newt gingrich say to a group of us earlier today and the gentleman from pennsylvania was a part of that as we had himcome to speak to members of the house we are not talking about lowhanging fruit here in regard to saving money and saving lives we are talking about fruit that is lying on the ground sitting there rotting waiting for us to pick it up so clearly that is what my message would be in regard to that"], [0.005528628826141357, 0.49447137117385864, 0, "i yield myself 5 minutes i rise in strong support of the legislation and would submit my opening statement for the record i would like to comment on some of the comments of my colleagues made earlier before i do that let me just take a moment to thank chairman barton and representative nathan deal and my own chairman chairman bill thomas for their support and effort in the development of this bill but instead of doing my opening statement let me comment on some of the things that have been said to this point first of all on the issue of privacy this bill sets the groundwork to improve privacy by putting in place a study of state privacy laws and federal privacy laws so we can see what is working what is not working how similar are the state laws where might their differences inhibit the security of a nationwide system in other words it gives us the knowledge we need to upgrade our hipaa system if indeed that is necessary it may tell us that is not necessary but it would be absolutely irresponsible to move ahead withoutthe information that will be developed as a result of this legislation hipaa already provides absolute protection of our health information what we want to know is when you do what this bill envisions that is you create a nationwide interoperable health information system to put that in place and secure personal health data are there changes you need to make in federal law are there commonalities in state laws that need to be brought closer are there any changes indeed that need to be made to absolutely secure individual personal health data as we move to this system that is the issue on privacy secondly this bill adopts a whole new coding system the icd10 system under todays system you cannot tell whether a hospital has made a great leap forward in quality because they are doing a better job or simply because they have changed an operative technique from an invasive operation to a noninvasive approach to that surgical procedure so we have to know more about what we are doing so we can talk honestly to ourselves about quality so we can upgrade quality and so we can pay accurately this bill does that this bill sets up an office of technology and we need that office to assure that the public and private sectors work together to create an environment in which great companies in america compete to provide the best possible technology all of which becomes interoperable so without a federal office involved without standards being set we will not have that interoperable system that we know is going to be so important to improve the quality of our health care system not only do we need to have standards we need to accelerate dissemination because the power of health information technology is not in a single provider it is in the systemwide impact of it so this bill helps disseminate that technology in part through its grant provision but realistically the government is not going to pay for this the system is going to do it because it creates such system efficiencies that it pays the system back however in addition to grants we encourage the system to be able to dissiminate technology by allowing consortium to develop by allowing a hospital in a small town to work with the big employers in that town the big insurers in that town to get together to get a good deal on technology or on several technologies so that technologies are appropriate to the providers but are interoperable so this not only deals with the development of standards with the dissemination of technology with building the knowledge base we need to ensure the privacy of personal health information it moves to a more modern coding system and it will deliver to us a dramatic revolutionary increase in the quality of health care available in america it will not only reduce medical errors and eliminate adverse drug interactions saving millions of dollars reduce administrative costs by billions but also allow us to do chronic disease management for our seniors care management for the severely ill and upgrade the quality of diagnosis and treatment and return ourselves to a patientcentered affordable health care system so this is an important bill that sets the foundation for the future and i am astounded at my colleagues on the other side of the aisle opposing it because it does not do things we are not yet prepared to do today the house of representatives has the opportunity to pass legislation that will lay the foundation for a new era in health care systemwide adoption of health information technology will dramatically improve the quality of care it will reduce medical errors reduce duplication and unnecessary care and bring cutting edge information to the service of doctors as they diagnose and treat their patients it will also eliminate many of the administrative inefficiencies that characterize the american health system and strengthen and protect the security and confidentiality of health information systems in short it will fundamentally advance the practice of medicine and improve the quality of care all americans will have access to unfortunately the adoption of health information technology has been frustratingly slow since the full potential of this technology can only be harnessed if it is widely disseminated amongst all types and sizes of providers it is imperative to pass h r 4157 to speed the adoption and diffusion of health information technology this legislation is modest in scope it lays the groundwork for fundamental change by removing the barriers to private sector adoption it provides for a national framework for the development and widespread dissemination of interoperable health information technology by creating an office to coordinate the development of a national health information system it promotes commonsense cooperation between doctors and hospitals and other providers by allowing entities to provide physicians and others with hardware software training or it support services it updates diagnosis coding systems for the digital age and provides an expedited process for ongoing updating of technology standards it begins a process for creating greater commonality amongst state and federal security and confidentiality laws and regulations in order to better protect and strengthen the exchange and health information additionally it provides grants for the adoption of health information technology to coordinate care among the uninsured and to implement technology in small physician practices finally it includes studies and reports on the expansion of telehealth services in medicare health information technology touches every aspect of the health care system it will enable us to provide disease management for all those with chronic illnesses care management for those with severe complex illnesses and provide access to preventive and appropriate care for the uninsured it will reduce medical errors adverse drug interactions and decisive support to improve the quality of diagnosing and treating patients the role technology can play in the systems of health care will be as revolutionary as the role technology has played in health care research and treatments h r 4157 removes barriers to greater adoption of information technology in the health system so the long overdue potential of technology can be realized in health care i reserve the balanceof my time 1400"], [0.0066130757331848145, 0.5066130757331848, 0, "i yield myself the balance of my time we have already seen evidence of actionat the federal level in march of 2004 in fact the fda and the epa issued a joint guidance to consumers about the issue of mercury in fish and that guidance was designed to try to strike a careful balance that would demonstrate both the benefits of eating fish as well as the potential dangers associated with exposure to mercury if the bill passes as presented and this is an issue with regard to warning on fish there are several things that would be authorized a state if it feels it has a peculiar situation could petition for a waiver so that they could apply a nonfederal standard to their warning there is absolutely nothing in the bill that would prohibit a state from issuing warnings it just cannot require that the manufacturer or distributor be the one that be required to place warnings on the product but the state could issue whatever warnings it saw fit to do so i think as mr rogers related earlier the tufts health and nutrition letter indicating that you have to be careful that you do not do more harm than good sometimes by issuing warnings that are blanket in nature i think that clearly indicates we could go in the wrong direction we believe the bill strikes a careful balance it does allow states that have peculiar situations to ask that they be allowed to put additional warnings on products in their state if they think that is justified we b~lieve that the current federal policy on mercury however in fish is an appropriate and adequate one and i would urge the defeat of this amendment"]]}
