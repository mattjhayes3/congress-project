in the bill that is before us the bill allows seismic exploration in wilderness candidate areas that is areas that have been recommended by the executive branch for wilderness or areas that have been designated by the executive branch or congress for further wilderness study it does not allow it in designated wilderness that was a compromise that was reached in the bill as introduced and which was reaffirmed by the interior committee by a vote of 29 to 11 this amendment would go further and breach that compromise by opening designated wilderness areas to explosive seismic testing second i would simply like to point out that no less valid a conservative than george will writing in the latest newsweek magazine has this to say and lie supports this bill there are 80 million acres of designated wilderness 56 million of them in alaska i might say parenthetically this bill does not affect alaska at all only 1 2 percent of the lower 48 states is wilderness only 4 percent could ever be so designated surely the nations vitality and security are not so marginal as to depend on that 4 percent we are not dealing with 4 percent today we are dealing only with about 2 percent someday we may

main purpose of this bill is to authorize federal agencies to contract with private debt collection agencies in order to collect delinquent federal debts my colleagues are already aware of the massive debts owed to the federal government and of the enormous amount of this debt that is delinquent mismanagement on the part of bureacrats has permitted these delinquent debts to accumulate the details of the problem are described in the recently issued report of the office of management and budget debt collection project on may 18 1981 the house passed h r 2811 a bill designed to help agencies manage their debts in a more businesslike fashion and to make agency debt collection activities more effective that bill was only one step in the effort to improve debt collection practices and to increase the revenue from delinquent debts because agencies have such a poor track record in managing their debts we must recognize that there may be times when agencies need assistance that is what the bill i have introduced today will do it will authorize and regulate the use of private debt collection agencies by the federal government i hope that use of private debt collectors in appropriate circumstances will increase the repayment of debts owed to the federal government i am convinced that use of these private collectors can be done in a way that is consistent with the right to privacy the rules that govern the contracting out of government functions and the laws that regulate debt collection practices this bill is necessary because it is not clear under present law that agencies have the authority to enter into contracts for debt collection services for many years the general accounting office took the position that federal agencies could not legally delegate the debt collection function to private contractors in order to overcome this restriction congress found it necessary to expressly authorize the use of private debt collectors for a specific category of debts in the education amendments of 1976 public law 94482 i was surprised when the general accounting office and the department of justice reversed this interpretation and amended the regulations for the federal claims collection act the amended regulations require agencies to consider contracting for debt collection services this rule change appeared in the federal register for april 17 1981 no adequate reason for the shift in legal position was cited by the general accounting office and the justice department in the explanation that accompanied the rule change i asked the congressional research service to take a look at the issue of the legality of contracting our for debt collection services crs found no clear legal explanation for the change in the opinion of the general accounting office and the justice department it seems to me that if an activity was once considered to violate federal law then it takes a legislative change in order to make that activity legal neither the comptroller general nor the attorney general has the authority to amend federal statutes because of the tremendous uncertainty engendered by the change to the federal claims collection act regulations we need to clarify the law no agency can responsibly rely on the newly revised rule i am concern ed that any action based on this questionable interpretation will lead to significant

spending over the next 5 years threatens the security of the entire world if approved by congress these proposals would destabilize our economy erode our defense alliances and accelerate the arms race the presidents defense budget is founded on the unrealistic assumption that an ever more powerful preemptive military force is the key to p secure defense this policy can only lead us toward war i believe that national security and world peace depend on economic strength nuclear disarmament and conventional arms limitations and cooperative international defense agreements the presidents program would undermine these objectives and thus threaten our real national security our nations armed forces must be fully equipped welltrained and thoroughly prepared and i would support a defense budget which would insure this but the presidents proposal greatly exceeds what is needed to maintain such a force he suggests funding for unreasonably expensive nuclear weapons programs such as the mx missile program for unreliable and unproven equipment such as the xm1 tank and for nuclear weapons that would increase the potential for a nuclear conflict such as the pershing and cruise ii missiles the presidents defense budget wastes badly needed federal revenue on a dangerous policy of military buildup the president hopes to more than double military expenditures from 173 9 billion in 1981 to 374 3 billion in 1986 a jump in defense allotments from 24 7 to 37 6 percent of the total federal budget in fiscal 1982 alone he plans a 15percent increase over 1981 to an estimated total obligational authority of 222 2 billion defense spending will be significantly higher still according to the congressional budget office which found the presidents inflation estimates for the 4 outyears to be low cbo determined that defense will cost 6 4 billion more in fiscal year 1982 that the president projects for 1986 defense spending would shoot up to at least 50 billion above the figure the president projects ceo estimates these unanticipated costs would have to be absorbed by the pentagon forcing cuts in programs the presidents proposals clearly exhibit poor economic planning increased dependence on the military budget will force inflation up rapidly and make it vitually impossible for our civilian economy to recover this impact will couple with the presidents proposed tax cuts to worsen our current economic instability i want to remind my colleagues that a similar policy of steeply increased military outlays together with unwillingness to raise tax rates during the vietnam war is primarily responsible for our current runaway inflation abroad the administration is urging out allies to adopt similar policies of expanded military might the presidents stated intention to embark on massive military stockpiling as well as the state departments growing pressure on allies to undertake simultaneous buildups already is beginning to strain unitedstates relations with several nations this policy is raising the risks involved in all international conflicts which might develop no matter how small the damage to our civilian economy which the presidents proposals would do poses a serious threat to national security by weakening the nations fiscal and economic role in the world under his plan we would be caught in a whirlpool of military spending that would drain our economy of its ability to provide social fiscal and military security if we are to be successful at bringing about an economic recovery we must reprogram some of these increases in defense spending toward human services an other civilian activities in the reagan military budget 75 percent of the planned defense increases above president carters proposals for 1982 are targeted for procurement of new weapons systems this would mean that a total of 68 5 billion will be committed to procurement contracts in fiscal year 1982 but much of that money will not actually be spent until 1984 or later when those contracts take effect this largescale lockup of funds will cause a sudden inflation jump by limiting available funds without producing consumable commodities a strong domestic economy cannot be achieved until the economy is made substantially less reliant on military expenditures military spending is a relatively poor stimulus for creating jobs and adds to inflation rather than helping to control it one billion dollars spent on mass transportation would create approximately 26 000 more jobs than the same amount spent on the mx missile system according to the council on economic priorities about the same advantage exists for money spent to create teaching jobs as compared to using it to generate military production this xegative effect of military outlays is worsened by the fact that many of the jobs generated by milltary spending are shortterm temporary positions that actually interfere with longterm resolution of our current employment problems the demands which largescale milltary spending put on competition for scarce resources such as highly skilled technicians and engineers and its upward impact on inflation will prevent the civilian sector from obtaining the resources it sorely needs for growth an artificial competitive advantage is created for militaryrelated industries in obtaining scarce resources by the dominant role pentagon expenditures play in our economy yet a disproportionately small quantity of commodities returns to our civilian economy military increases come at the cost of vital federal programs that serve basic human needs programs that feed people for example will be cut by almost 5 billion and funds for public service employment would be eliminated to save 4 8 billion the inequity of these budget priorities cannot be overlooked macroeconomic studies support the examnples i have given of how the presidents military budget proposals would undermine efforts to improve the economy the world bank and the unitedstates arms control agency for example compiled data which showed that steppedup military spending tends to weaken national economies the study compared the percent of gnp used for military purposes to the growth in manufacturing productivity in seven industrialized nations for the years 196077 those nations which used relatively large portions of their gnp for defense such as the united states generally had lowgrowth rates japan for example gave the lowest gnp percentage to defense ninetenths of 1 percent and had by far the highest annual growth rate 8 8 percent at the other end of the scale the united states put 7 6 percent of its gnp toward defense and had the second lowest growth rate at only 3 4 percent annually i believe the united states faces continued severe economic stagnation as a result of growing military spending historically the policy of the united states has been to develop cooperative defense strategies with ita allies to insure international and domestic security we currently are involved in some 29 formal agreements the nato alliance most prominent among them the nato alliance provides the democratic world with a significant margin of international security both in number of strategic weapons and in strategic planning capability nato countries outspent warsaw pact nations during the 1970s by 207 billion on military goods and possess 3 200 more strategic nuclear weapons a renewed commitment to natoprovided security by the united states and our european allies would create a cheaper and less dangerous world situation than would a unitedstates initiated worldwide arms buildup arms control measures and disarmanent agreements offer an important longterm approach to mutual security and international peace the salt 11 process brought us close to a reasonable check against further nuclear expansion this agreement should be ratified it is a necessary step toward disarmament although salt ii itself falls far short of real disarmament negotiations for reductions in european theater nuclear forces merit strong unitedstates support west german chancellor helmut schmidt recently proposed a freeze on the deployment of our europeanbased pershing 11 and cruise missiles pending negotiations for mutual reductions among nato and warsaw pact nations these missiles clearly increase the risk of a nuclear attack on europe both soviet and unitedstates officials already have give attention to a comprehensive test ban for nuclear weapons that would open a direct avenue to a nuclear weapons freeze negotiations on such a ban should be continued substantial reductions can be made in the presidents proposals for the military budget in five areas without weakening unitedstates defense funding for programs that increase our nuclear weapons stockpile those which simply generate repetitive weaponry weapons which the administration plans to produce even though testing on them is either incomplete or indicates significant problems the tremendously expensive mx missile system and generally the elimination of widespread waste in defense programs production of the trident submarine americas most expensive nuclear weapon in production at a projected 1982 cost of 1 6 billion is one of the unnecessary weapons in the presidents budget the tomahawk cruise maissile which threatens to undermine future arms control measures could be eliminated at a savings of 391 million for fiscal 1982 as well the european theater nuclear forces which i mentioned earlier are budgeted for 932 million for 1982 these missile systems would create a substantial offensive nuclear threat to the soviet union and further polarize the alreadytense european situation antiballistic missiles which would violate slt 1 could be eliminated and thus save 438 million without reducing unitedstates security there are several cases of repetitive weaponry in the current military budget these include the cx airlift planes which the administration plans to begin development of at~ a cost of 250 million for fiscal year 1982 even though the similar c5 transport is not yet fully operational due to production and operating problems f14 and f15 fighter planes which last year received a higher authorization from congress than the pentagon requested are scheduled to receive an additional 2 4 billion but these planes would provide no significant new cappbilities the extremely costly and controversial xm1 battle tank is prematurely budgeted for production at 2 billion in the reagan 1982 budget the reliability and durability of the xm1 was called into serious question both by a department of defense appointed panel of technical experts and by a gao study both investigations expressed doubt that the tank was ready for production the mx missile system is probably the greatest boondoggle of the military budget estimated for fiscal 1982 at 2 9 billion this controversial weapons system is likely to coast more than 100 billion before it is finished possibly as soon as 1986 military experts many citizens and several members of congress have questioned the feasibility and advisability of the proposed landbasing mode for the mx and no alternatives have yet been seriously explored yet the president is actively pursuing deployment of the mx of equally great concern is the direct threat the mx would create to soviet security forcing escalation of the arms race undermining arms limitation talks and substantially increasing world tensions if the president were truly interested in eliminating waste from the oovernmient no department deserves closer scrutiny than the defense department omb director david stockman recently told a congressional committee that pentagon waste was widespread but the administration has thus far avoidcd making cuts there several investigations documented waste in the pentagon in eight major areas one recent investigation of pentagon waste found that a minimum estimate of the cost of military waste is put at 15 billion a year the sources of waste are in many areas of the military and the problem clearly is pervasive needless purchases of goods already in stock performance of unnecessary operations and poor supervision contribute several billion dollars of waste of materials equipment and fuel one study found a complicated overlapping management system among the four branches of the armed services causes costly repetition of equipment maintenance base supervision and other services generating massive amounts of waste"], [0.001568436622619629, 0.9984315633773804, 1, "the purpose of this

offensive and defensive capabilities in all three areas of our defense programon land on sea and in thle air this amendment represents a bold but essential attempt to curtail what i see to be a dangerous american desire to continualy spend money on new and supposedly superior equipment at the expense of existing weapons systems a perfect case in point is the bi bomber no vem ber 18 1981 h 849 there are numerous reasons why we should oppose the building of the b1 this issue of cost must be seen as critical partiularly in light of two factorsconflicting estimates and inflation official estimates have varied significantly and risen dramatically in recent months in july the air force said that it would cost 19 7 billion in 1981 dollars which climbed to 20 5 billion by october a defense department estimate stated the cost to be 27 to 28 billion in 1981 dollars further both gao and the congressional budget office have offered significantly higher estimates gao stated estimates were short by 5 5 billion and cbo using its own assumptions came up with 26 2 billion with inflation assumptions these costs climb even higher cbo using administration inflation assumptions calculated 34 5 billion in costs and using its own assumptions came up with 39 8 billion given the history of military spending on strategic defense equipment which sees an everincreasing bill to produce the same piece of equipment over time we cannot be sure that the same will not happen to the bi given the current economic recession which does not foresee a declining inflation rate until late next yearat the earliestwhy should we lock ourselves into a stopgap program whose costbenef it over time is at best uhpredictable to spend 250 to 400 million for every bi bomber given our current economic situation would be foolhardy the capabilities of the bi must also be questioned we have heard conflicting reports from the higest levels of the administration in recent days about the relative effectiveness of the bi as well as its projected operational date defense secretary weinberger recently stated that to send the bi against soviet defenses in 1990 or after would be a suicide mission given the technological advances we would realize by then this conern was also echoed by former defense secretary brown and gen richard ellis former commander in chief of the strategic air command to fund a longrange weapons system such as the bi even under the most optimistic assumptions would give us a fleet of 100 obsolete bombers by 1990 which would perform for less than onethird of their planned life the bi cannot justify its enormous cost by assuring us that we will have a design mission capable of multiple defense roles it cannot be considered a viable candidate to be a premier strategic weapon for our defense arsenal if it will be unable to penetrate soviet defenses into the 1990s the issue of the unitedstates commitment to arms control must also be considered when discussing the fateof the bi today president reagan in his first major foreign policy address clearly underscored the american commitment to arms control through mnutual reductions with the soviets if we continue with the presidents proposal to build the bi we will most certainly be sending mixed signals to the soviets how can we advocate arms controland fault the soviets for their unchecked weapons buildup when we would be doing the same i george kennan the renowned soviet historian and former ambassador to moscow recently stated that our perceptions of the soviet unions defense capabilities were an endless series of distortions and oversimplifications and routine exaggeration as the intellectual leader in the 1940s who spearheaded the unitedstates policy visavis the soviets of containment we would be welladvised to heed his words he clearly sees the rhetoric of the defense department on soviet military might a contributing factor to the unchecked growth of our own defense programs to build the bi would be to believe the false hysteria which has been created to justify its production we do not need a new bomberwe can adequately equip our current defense systems with additional capabilities to carry us through the next decade until the stealth and cruisemissile programs become reality the work and the recommendations of the appropriations committee must also be considered this bill appropriates 196 7 billion for the department of defense a reduction of 4 2 billion from the budget and an increase of 25 billion from 1981 the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee has heard 8 months of testhnony which has filled nine volumes totalling 8 000 pages he clearly believes that to build the bi would be to build a military as well as a fiscal bomb the distinguished chairman of the full appropriations committee mr whitten agrees with him i fully concur with them that the bi is a thing of the past and that we should concentrate our resources on building a more advanced system which will carry us into the 1990s and also provide us a shortterm system which can fill the gap between now and when the stealth becomes available it has been suggested that the pb111 could fill this gap and would be comparable to 100 bis at a cost of 8 billion the 32 billion difference between the two is enough to fund the entire stealth program and at the same time accelerate the cruise missile program this is but one of many other options open to us if we forego the bi finally i must make a case against the bi in light of the human costs involved to date we have cut 35 billion in programs through reconciliation which directly affect the lives of millions of americans intemperate defense spending must be checked if we are to maintain even an a~dequate offset in the budget for vital human service programs this is the largest defense budget in our nations historyat a ttrsie when we have mainmouth cuts in iiondefenserelated programs and are

why the disclosure requirement the socalled defect disclosure requirement of the rule is both ambiguous and ineffective although the provision clearly states that an inspection of the car is not required many of the 52 listed defects which dealers must disclose are such that accurate disclosure could not be made unless an inspection is conducted if the dealer does not inspect the car he will

had jurisdiction over this bill this is a proposed in my judgment unfair trade barrier which comes less than a week after our unitedstates trade representatives and members of the house and senate came back from the gatt ministerial meeting in geneva at which time all of us pledged to promote a moratorium on new trade barriers all over the world it seems to me there is no reason why we should support this restriction particularly in light of the fact that it is nongermane and there have been no house hearings on it currently total uranium imports to the united states are less than 10 percent of the unitedstates consumption and those imports come from friendly allies about threequarters of them come from canada and australia under the current limitations which are scheduled for phaseout this year imports from 1977 through 1981 were less than half of the allowed maximum imports have risen from 5 percent in 1977 to 10 percent in 1981 less than 10 percent and that is no evidence of a surge in imports the national security argument is feeble too it is estimated that government and commercial inventories of uranium could supply the nation for 12 years the president as it is well known already has the authority under 19 unitedstatesc 1562 to limit imports whenever he finds them to be a threat to national security the administration opposes this provision very strongly the domestic uranium industrys problem is not imports but a low demand caused by a slowdown in the nuclear powerplant program we can likely expect to provide some sort of compensation under our international trade treaties and that compensation will probably be aimed at unitedstates agricultural exports or at hightechnology exports i would guess that this compensation would be in the neighborhood of 200 million further the cost to consumers of this amendment is staggering the administration estimates that by 1990 the additional consumer cost would be about 1 6 billion the

the cause not the reason why we have the difficulties that we do let me also say something in defense of american management it is wrong to come here to the house of representatives and criticize american management and american management decisions when they have only responded the best way that they can and know how to a legal environment to a regulatory environment to a tax environment that we have created for them american automobile companies and american workers did not decide or control the preferences of american consumers that led to the debacle caused by opec price increases with oil the thing that the gentleman from florida really means i think when he is talking about an industry in transition it is wrong to criticize american management and american labor who are doing a fantastic job of retooling an industry in response to billion dollar needs for changeovers required by consumer preference changes i see the gentleman from minnesota the gentleman from minnesota is on the floor i wonder if we might engage in a little colloquy that we had discussed earlier concerning the japanese decision to restrict their markets to our cigarettes the gentleman had come to me and wanted to perhaps put a little on the record we discussed this issue during the trade subcommittee hearings on page 657 of the committees testimony is a copy of the article that appeared in the washington post the gentleman wanted to make some remarks and i yield for that purpose"], [0.0045056939125061035, 0.5045056939125061, 1, "i join my colleagues on this sad occasion to pay tribute to the memory of olin e tiger teague tiger teague was a member of this body for 32 years where he served his district the state of texas and the veteran with great distinction and dedication it was in 1946 while a patient in a unitedstates army hospital in texas that he was first elected to congress tiger was a bona fide war hero he was the member of congress with the highest number of decorations and awards for valor and heroism which included several silver stars for gallantry in action against the enemy bronze stars for valor and purple hearts for wounds received in combat against the enemy he was commander of foot soldiers on the battlefields of europe during world war ii tiger teague had been in an army hospital for 2 years for disabilities which resulted in his being awarded his third purple heart ironically it was this third combatincurred wound which ultimately caused him to retire from the congress in 1978 i mention this disability for the purpose of emphasizing that tiger teague always identified with combat and dis abled veterans all of his years in congress undoubtedly the 2 years he spent in an army hospital helped him to gain an insight into the desires concerns and needs of veterans that was to help him to earn the title of mr veteran on capitol hill for over a quarter of a century tiger teague authorized more bills for veterans rights benefits and assistance than any member in the history of congress a few highlights are legislation which established the department of medicine and surgerya 172hospital system and other facilities which is one of our veterans greatest health assets the korean and vietnam conflict gi bills which have not only helped millions of veterans to go to college but have helped the general welfare by training hundreds of thousands of physicians dentists engineers technicians teachers and others who have made this nation the leader of the free world the war orphans education assistance act for the survivors of those who made the supreme sacrifice in defense of the nation and a loan guarantee program which has helped millions of veterans to purchase a home and is vital to the housing and mortgage banking industry tiger teague was a leader he was a statesman his interests and concerns went far beyond veterans hewas for a strong national defense he was for a strong fiscal policy he abhorred waste and inefficiency he was opposed to a bloated bureaucracy he loved america while he kept his intense interest in the welfare of veterans to the day he died he was also deeply involved in the space age soon after america was taken by surprise when russia launched its first sputnik in 1957 congress established the science and technology committee tiger teague was elected a member of this new committee later he waq to become its ii 242 chairman under his leadership the united states not only surpassed the russians but was successful in landing a man on the moon just this year we electrified the world with our incredible voyageur journeys which have advanced the science of astronomy beyond our wildest dreams of only a few years ago tiger teague was also honored by his colleagues when he was elected to chair the democratic caucus during the 92d and 93d congresses he was a man of great personal ability who was admired by veterans everywhere he loved this country and all it stands for he loved the congress our nation has lost a great man who labored hard and long for the causes to which he was devoted i join with all members to extend my deepest sympathy to mrs teague and their children"], [0.004819214344024658, 0.5048192143440247, 1, "i rise in strong support of the amendment offered by our distinguished colleague from massachusetts for the past several years the legislative veto and the fate of the federal trade commission have been inextricably intertwined at several points the agencys funding was literally held hostage until a veto was provided over ftc regulations now we are asked to make this provision a permanent part of the federal trade commission act in the last congress i served as chairman of the consumer protection subcommittee which had jurisdiction over the ftc i would like to share vith you my observations on the efficacy of the legislative veto with respect to the ftc in the spring of 1980 the fic had not had an authorization bill for 3 years because the house and senate could not agree on legislative review provisions indeed the house defeated two ftc conference reports in 1978 because they did not include an acceptable legislative veto provision it was clearly the will of the house that ftc rules be subject to congressional review accordingly as chairman of the house conferees on the ftc authorization bill i agreed reluctantly to the incluslon of a twohouse legislative veto with expediated procedures although i had grave misgivings i hoped that the veto would provide the procedural framework for a reasoned and fair review of the ftc trade regulations as our colleague from georgia a major leader in the thrust toward a legislative vetotold us the reforms included in the authorization bill are not designed to restrict proper conduct rhey are intended to make the ftc more compatable to congress and the public mid enhance its credibility the legislative veto has failed to meet its much heralded objectives indeed our worst fears were realized in the only matter taken up under the veto mechanism that matter involved the veto of the pitifully modest used car rule the original strong consumer protection measure had been diluted after years of usedcar industry lobbying the final proposal merely required that the dealer provide the consumer with an accurate statement of warranty coverage if any and whether there were any known defects however the industry lobbyists determined that not even these limited facts should be required to be given to used car buyers and through the procedures designed to prevent bureaucratic excesses lobbied to have the used car regulation vetoed the sorry spectacle of congress rushing to defend the used car dealer from the onerous standard of being truthful with consumers on whether there was a warranty on the car and what kind and whether the car had any known defects needs no further elaboration we are seriously deluding ourselves if we believe that the legislative veto provides a reasoned fair examination of the issues as the used car matter amply demonstrates it does not our limited experience with the legislative veto clearly does not provide a basis for making this temporary provision a permanent part of the ftc act indeed if anything our experience fully supports the amendment of the gentleman from massachusetts to strike this prevision i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment e"]]}
