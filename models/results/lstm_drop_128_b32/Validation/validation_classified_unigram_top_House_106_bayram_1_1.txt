senate passed concurrent resolutions to recognize these brave veterans for their service and contribution toward the successful outcome of world war ii in october of 1996 president clinton issued a presidential proclamation recalling the courage the sacrifice and the loyalty of the filipino veterans of world war ii and honoring them for their contribution to our freedom hearings have been held in both the house and the senate on the issue of benefits for filipino world war ii veterans and the president included a line item in both fy 1999 and fy 2000 presidential budgets for filipino world war h veterans then just 3 months ago the filipino veterans ssi extension act h r 26 was incorporated into h r 1802 which passed this house this bill will allow filipino world war ii veterans who are currently on ssi and living in the united states to return to the philippines if they wish to do so taking a portion of their ssi with them many are currently living alone and in poverty financially unable to bring their families to the united states nor to return to their homeland most importantly h r 1802 will allow those who wish to return to the philippines to be with their loved ones in their final days but it also saves the unitedstates government money money that could be used to balance the costs of the bill that the gentlemq n fkom new york 4mr gilyan and 1 jpave introduced the

world war ii veterans were promised when they were drafted into military service by president franklin d roosevelt with their vital participation so crucial to the successful outcome of this war one

health care our bill that we have introduced will provide access to va medical facilities for these veterans both in the united states and in the philippines we have designed the bill so that it will also provide greater access to va medical facilities in the philippines for unitedstates veterans who are living abroad in addition the bill will also increase the serviceconnected disability

that we have now is that health care has changed the way we treat people has changed instead of it being in the hospital and with operations and inpatient prescription drugs we are now in a situation

thatcoigress already has the authority to adopt multiyear budget plans and multiyear authorizations these have been important instruments in achieving advance planning and fiscal discipline but to go beyond this to biennial budgeting and appropriating would greatly weaken congress hand in shaping national priorities and holding the executive branch accountable in fact annual appropriating is necessary as a complement to multiyear budget plans to ensure flexibility responsiveness and coequal power with the executive under biennial budgeting congress would not be able to react as effectively to congressional oversight gao reports inspector generals reports research studies and other findings that bear on the effectiveness of federal programs agencies would have to begin working in late spring on a 2year budget the second year of which would not commence for some 28 months the president and omb would make budget decisions 22 to 23 months before the beginning of the second year of a budget cycle biennial appropriations could limit the ability of the federal government to use fiscal policy to stabilize the economy during economic downturns there would be pressure to frequently revise 2year budgets through supplemental after supplemental appropriations bills we know from experience that these supplemental appropriations are less deliberative and less systematic than regular appropriations bills and they are certainly less subject to fiscal discipline and control now some proponents argue that biennial budgeting would leave congress more time to conduct oversight of the executive branch that is an ironic claim for the unique oversight provided through the appropriations process when agency budgets and performance are gone over line by line program by program is one of the most important tools we have in holding the executive branch accountable offyear oversight under biennial appropriations would become less intense less systematic and most importantly it would lose the teeth provided by the actual power of decision proponents have talked today about the support from the three most recent presidents for biennial appropriations bill clinton george bush ronald reagan why should that surprise anyone of course presidents support biennial budgeting if that support indicates biennial budgeting is not a partisan issue it surely makes our point for us that it is an institutional issue biennial budgeting would result in a major devolution of power from congress to the executive branch we would do our appropriating in the first 9 months of a congress and become fiscal lame ducks thereafter with executive agencies less subject to effective scrutiny and direction that would be a loss not only for individual members and

working group was established by congress as part of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations act and based on legislation i introduced in the last session of congress it requested that nih establish the group to develop a comprehensive plan for nihfunded diabetes research dr ronald kahn is an outstanding physician and scientist he was selected the chairman of the group he has spent literally thousands of hours meeting and talking with countless individuals to establish a consensus on the direction of diabetes research the report has exceeded all expectations it clearly details the magnitude of the disease both on the individual and on our society on an individual level diabetes affects virtually every tissue of the body with severe damage since 1980 the ageadjusted death rate due to diabetes has increased by 30 percent while the death rate has fallen for other common diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke diabetes affects about 16 million americans with 800 000 new cases diagnosed each year the societal impact is likewise staggering one in four medicare dollars are spent to treat people with diabetes and over one in 10 health care dollars spent are spent for diabetes in economic terms the cost to society is over 105 billion each year the report identifies five areas of extraordinary research opportunities for making progress in understanding and treating and ultimately preventing and curing diabetes these five areas are the genetics of diabetes and its complications autoimmunity and the beta cell cell signaling and cell regulation obesity and clinical trials and research within each area specific research recommendations are made and in all areas rapid advancements are anticipated finally conquering diabetes the name of this report presents an
