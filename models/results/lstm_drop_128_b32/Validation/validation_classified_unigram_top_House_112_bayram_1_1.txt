seems to believe that there might be millions of americans who are getting rich by applying for food stamps let me assure the good senator from alabama that it is not fraud that is causing the rising demand for nutrition assistance in america but the years of failed economic policies that have lined the pockets of corporate billionaires and left average americans behind a program with one of the lowest fraud rates of any program in our entire government is not out of control but let me state as clearly as i can having to apply for food stamps to put enough food on the table to keep your children from going hungry is not like winning the lottery one in seven americans do receive food stamps but millions more are eligible but dont apply and im certain that each and every family would be willing to trade in their book of food stamps for a decent job with livable wages and benefits im taking part in the fourth annual food stamp challenge along with several other members on this side

corporations it is also immoral redistribution from the poor and middle class to the wealthy is the most indefensible aspect of the welfare state yet it is the most accepted form of welfare at a time when the federal government is running unprecedentedly large budget deficits why are we reauthorizing subsidies for large corporations i hope that my colleagues who criticize welfare for the poor on moral and constitutional grounds will vote against this program that provides welfare for the rich proponents of continued american support for exim claim that the bank creates jobs and promotes economic growth however this claim rests on a version of what the great economist henry hazlitt called the broken window fallacy when a hoodlum throws a rock through a store window it can be said he has contributed to the economy as the store owner will have to spend money having the window fixed the benefits to those who repaired the window are visible for all to see therefore it is easy to see the broken window as economically beneficial however the benefits of the broken window are revealed as an illusion when one takes into account what is not seen the businesses and workers who would have benefited had the store owner not spent money repairing a window but rather been free to spend his money as he chose similarly the beneficiaries of exim are visible to all what is not seen is the products that would have been built the businesses that would have been started and the jobs that would have been created had the funds used for exim been left in the hands of consumers leaving those funds in the private sector ensures that those resources will be put to the use most highly valued by individual consumers in contrast when the government diverts resources into the public sector via programs such as exim their use is determined by bureaucrats and politically powerful special interests resulting in a distorted market and a misallocation of resources by distorting the market and preventing resources from achieving their highest valued use exim actually costs americans jobs and reduces americas standard of living finally i would like to remind my colleagues that there is simply no constitutional justification for the expenditure of funds on programs such as exim in fact the framers of the constitution would be horrified to know that the federal government was taking hardearned money from the american people in order to benefit the politically powerful in conclusion exim distorts the market by allowing government bureaucrats to make economic decisions instead of individual consumers exim also violates basic principles of morality by forcing american taxpayers to subsidize the operations of wealthy companies that could easily afford to engage in international trade without government assistance exim also violates the limitations on congressional power to take the property of individual citizens and use it to benefit powerful special interests it is for these reasons that i strongly urge my colleagues to reject h r 2072"], [0.999534398317337, 0.00046560168266296387, 1, "so reclaiming my time i think that the straight answer is no in fact our ranking member and others have been unable to get that from the navy liaisons office again i think its an offense to the military to secondguess their training for chaplains no doubt those documents could eventually come our wayand should for oversight activitiesbut for us to somehow defund the training of chaplains to implement dont ask dont tell makes no sense again chaplains will be worried for instance catholic chaplains will be worried to advise their followers that homosexuality is a sin if that is not included in the training those for whom homosexuality is not a sin will also likewise be worried about advising the troops there will be a void a huge voidto not train the spiritual advisors to members of our military about the implementation of dont ask dont tell i mean why not try to not train any of the troops i mean again whether you supported it or not i think most of us believe that it was better that there was a training process than lets say a court has orderedwhich has now happened absent a training process and instantaneous change with regard to the chaplaincy to secondguess an internal military training documentagain which they have indicated that they will revise accordinglyis to show a huge lack of judgment of the men and women who run the military an enormous lack of confidence in the institution of the chaplaincy an offense to the chaplaincy of the military to somehow deign that congress is expressing that they should not be trained regarding a major military policy that they should somehow take the risk on their own that they should worry about advising members of their faith with regard to within their faith tradition whether homosexuality is a sin or not regarding members of their faith as to whether they can be married or not this is a diverse country religiously and likewise the institution of our military reflects that diversity and to somehow again secondguess a military training document that hasnt even been read by the prime sponsor of this amendment shows a tremendous lack of faith and is a very dangerous precedence for congress in terms of interfering with the training procedures of the military we could of course as a body or as individual members go through every single training manual and find things we like find things we dont like but again to micromanage the military to that extent particularly in light of a policy change which has ramifications for the chaplaincy the chaplaincy is by and large where the rubber meets the road with regard to how individual members are being advised about their sexual orientation about what behaviors are moral and what behaviors are immoral and to somehow say that congress will tell the chaplaincy not to train anybody on implementing this policy change leaves our soldiers in a spiritual lurch it leaves our christian soldiers in a spiritual lurch it leaves our jewish soldiers in a spiritual lurch our muslim soldiers in a spiritual lurch all of those who take advantage of the good offices of the chaplaincy in the military just as of course we have a chaplain in this fine institution the united states congress so again this is a change that perhaps many members of the chaplaincy were not in favor ofsome were it depends on their faith position their own political opinionsbut they need to be trained in accordance with military protocols and this amendment would gut

is avoiding and prohibiting an employer as a condition of employment from demanding a confidential facebook passwordtwitter tumblror any social media of the like it reads this way nothing in this act or the amendments made by this act shall be construed to permit an employer a prospective employer or the federal government to require the disclosure of a confidential password for a social networking web site or a personal account of an employee or job applicant without a court order or permit the federal government to establish a mechanism to control united states citizens access to and use of the internet through the creation of a national internet firewall similar to the great internet firewall of china as determined by the director of national intelligence so what this amendment does is two things it is the final amendment to this bill there are no more amendments to this bill i know some people voted against this amendment when it was brought up a couple of weeks ago and for those of you who regret voting against it youre going to get a chance to correct that vote this is something ive been working on with mr heinrich and mr mchenry it just says were not going to allow as a condition of employment the requirement of a facebook password or the like now there is a reason for this one there is all sorts of personal information that i may have or that somebody else may have with respect to facebook or twitter or linkedin whatever it might be and theyre entitled to have an expectation of privacy a sense that their freedom of speechtheir freedom to peaceably assemble in effectis not violated so thats the first reason the second reason is if an employer or the federal government poses as somebody by having their facebook passwords then they can impersonate they can become imposters it is a twoway exchange of information so that somebody who is completely unrelated to the employment now is communicating with an impostor thats another reason for this the third reason is for the employers themselves to avoid liability by learning information that may then cause them to take actions that would violate a protected group so there are at least three good reasons to do this we have precedent in our law and it is the employee polygraph protection act of 1988 we said were not going to allow as a condition of employment the use of lie detectors you can use background checks and you can use references there are plenty of vehicles by which to check out somebodys employment references but were not going to allow lie detectors and we should not allow that the facebook passwords be given up as a condition of employment so we have precedent in the law we dont allow polygraphs or lie detectors as a condition of employment lets use what we already havebackground checks references et cetera the second piece of this is that we will not allow the command and control of the internet or access to the internet by the united states government saying that which is similar that we want to avoid what has happened in china that we want to avoid what has happened in iran we dont want the internet taken down and our access individuals access to the internet broken so there are two pieces to this one is not allowing the demand of a confidential password and not allowing the government to have the command and control and the ability to take down the internet an action similar to what weve seen in other countries this is a very simple amendment its very straightforward weve had a lot of amendments that have garnered the support of virtually every member of this house this should be one of those this is the final amendment i would hope that we would uphold the constitution by passing this amendment as well as by making sure that the

the national blue alert act of 2011 this bill would create a federal information network that would make it easier to track down and prosecute those who seriously injure or kill state and federal law enforcement officers in 2011 a total of 72 law enforcement officers were killed by perpetrators 10 of which were in my home state of california for the first time in 14 years there were more officers killed by gunfire than officers killed in traffic accidents gun violence against law enforcement had declined in recent decades however there was a 70 percent increase from 2008 to 2011 the cause for this increase is unknown but with technology growing better each day and methods becoming more sophisticated these statistics should be going in the opposite direction some officers attribute the rise in deaths to budget cuts and officers not having the necessary resources to ensure their own safety others believe that the new trend of sending officers to the most violent areas of the city as a preventative measure has led to the spike regardless this is a problem that needs an immediate solution due to this dramatic increase in only a few short years the fbi conducted a study which showed many of the officers were killed while attempting to arrest or subdue a suspect who already had a history of violent crimes with this information they implemented a new federal program so that now when an officer pulls over a car and runs the license plate they will be informed if the suspect has a violent criminal record so they can be properly prepared while this new program is a step in the right direction law enforcement officers will always be put in high risk situations it is simply the nature of the job they put their lives on the line everyday to protect the citizens of this country and they deserve to know their government is doing everything it can to provide them with as much safety as possible the national blue alert act of 2011 would ease the minds of officers reassuring them of a quick and efficient response should anything happen to them while on duty the bill would also increase the likelihood of catching a perpetrator who injures or kills an officer every stop an officer makes can be potentially fatal yet these men and women go to work every day because they know their service will save the lives of countless others with this level of self sacrifice the very least we can do as elected officials is provide them with the reassurances within the national blue alert act today i ask my colleagues to rise up in support of the national blue alert act of 2011 a

use of the planes that we ride in of the other sources that consume the oil that we use in our country and what they are going to do the republicans is tie the hands of the epa to back out the 5 million barrels of oil that we import from opec on a daily basis opec is not afraid of the foreign affairs committee opec is not afraid of the armed services committee it is the energy committee that they are afraid of they are afraid that one day we will actually have a policy that backs out their imported oil that denies them the 150 billion or 200 billion a year that we send over to them that

stop the twilight zone well that is very much where we are this week on the house floor we are truly entering another dimensiona wondrous land of paranoid imagination republicans call it the operational control zone but it is really the drone zone submitted for your consideration are the following facts this week world leaders are gathering in rio to deal with the threat of global warming meanwhile the majority has us gathered here to address the threat sea lions pose to salmon right now firefighters are working day and night to try to contain wildfires in forests in colorado and new mexico and the majority has us working here to give away oldgrowth alaskan forest we have just 2 weeks before the transportation authorization bill expires and student loan rates double and what are we doing we are spending an entire day on a piece of legislation that has zero chance of being enacted into law it is a package of bad ideas that are largely irrelevant to the real issues facing our nation title i of this bill would flood part of a wild and scenic river title iii is an earmark to an alaskan native corporation that will facilitate clearcutting in the tongass national forest titles

fish title x would overturn the protections for endangered turtles from being run over by offroad vehicles title xi would extend the practice of belowcost grazing on public landsa bargainbasement discount for cattlemen all across this country not paying their fair share actually being a type of federal welfare for cattlemen and unbelievably title xiv would create a 100mile drone zone along our northern and southern borders within which the border patrol could suspend 36 environmental laws and seize control of all public land management let me spend a moment here talking about what i find to be the most offensive part of this legislation title xiv this is the national map what the republicans do here today is they take a 100mile area all along the northern border of the united states and the southern border of the united states and they create a new area and this new area is really a drone zone the reason that its a drone zone is that it allows for 36 health and safety and environmental laws to be overridden and it would expand the area where the department of homeland security could use drones for surveillance it allows the department of homeland security to shut down national parks at a moments notice so all of a sudden the department of homeland security can start using drones in this area now when you add up all of the space that is now included it is equal to the total area of california massachusetts new hampshire and connecticut combined which will now be in this new special area that has the department of homeland security determining where drones can be used and as we know that wont be just for ensuring environmental laws not being violated theyll be over this whole area now if you take a look at this map i understand why the gentleman from utah introduced this bill utah is far away from the republican drone zone theyre not within the hundred miles of the border of the mexican or canadian people but what if you live in maine nearly your entire state is in this drone zone want to go to acadia national park better check with the department of homeland security and the republicans first or minnesota maybe you want to take a trip up to the boundary waters better check with the department of homeland security and the republicans first or olympia national park in washington state better check with the department of homeland security or the republicans first want clean air in the drone zone better make sure the department of homeland security and the republicans havent exempted the clean air act want to drink some water after a long hike better make sure the department of homeland security and the republicans havent waived the safe drinking water act make no mistake this isnt a bill that actually addresses americas immigration issues neither the department of homeland security nor its customs and border protection division support this bill they dont want this authority but the republicans are insisting on giving them this authority100 miles along the mexican and canadian borders the gops drone zone bill does not increase resources for border agents but instead turns over our natural resources to the department of homeland security passing this bill does not increase the number of border patrol agent boots on the ground it just ignores the protections against trampling on sovereign and sacred ground like tribal grave sites it does not look for a path toward citizenship it tells families on vacation or a picnic that the department of homeland security can kick you off a path at any moment under this bill ranchers and their cattle can be herded away by border agents jeopardizing their entire ranching operation families and visitors to public parks can have their trips canceled and the
