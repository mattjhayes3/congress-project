capitol senator tim scott for a tremendous speech he gave on the floor of the senate last evening i thank him so much for sharing with the american people an issue that has for some reason converged with our overall discussions of gun violence now tonight at around 7 30 we are going to have a national speakout here on the west lawn of the capitol we will be speaking out on this whole issue of gun violence i am particularly interested in one part of our effort dealing with background checks now some have said that background checks legislation that we are proposing would not have had any impact on most of these issues if not all well i beg to differ when it comes to charleston and the emanuel 9 the facts are very clear that the gentleman who purchased the gun that he used to murder those nine souls doing their bible study at emanuel ame church june 17 of last year was not eligible by law to have purchased a gun because of a 72hour rule that we have in our background check laws if you apply to purchase a gun and the background check is undertaken and it is not completed in 3 days you can go back and get the gun irrespective of whether or not you are eligible to have it now thanks to the government accountability office 2 days ago they issued a study and the study covered a period of 10 years from 2006 to 2015 here is what they have revealed during that 10year period 89 000 requests to purchase a gun were denied because of domestic abuse however 6 700 were purchased by people who were ineligible because of that 3day rule now over 90 percent of the people who apply to purchase a weapon have their background checks completed within 2 days but there is that 10 percent that require additional scrutiny we dont know whether or not people intentionally give the wrong information if someone really wanted to curtail the law and knows what the law is that person could very well give the wrong address give the wrong middle initial do something to cause the background check to be extended beyond the 3day period the gentleman who purchased the gun in the case of the emanuel 9 it was an interesting confluence of mistakes it had nothing to do with the bureaucracy for some strange reason when he was arrested for his problem rather than taking him to the columbia jail they took him to the west columbia jail so when they looked for his record they looked for the record in columbia but for some strange reason the record was across the river in west columbia by the time they detected what the problem was the 3 days had expired and he was able to purchase a gun within days of that purchase he went online and he studied the history of emanuel ame church the church where denmark vesey organized an insurrection in 1822 in the basement of emanuel church he looked at that history he saw emanuel ame church as one of the most historical african american churches not just in the state of south carolina but in the country and he targeted that church he went there invited himself into the bible study with these blessed souls and sat with them for an hour then he got up took out the gun that he had bought which he was not eligible to purchase and began to murder them systematically one woman ms sanders is here in washington and will be here with us this evening lost her son her aunt and a cousin the reason she is still with us today is because she played dead under a table while covering up her little grandchildren she watched her son walk up to the shooter and say why are you doing this we mean you no harm but he said i have got to do it why because i want to start a race war well he did not start a race war this whole country saw what forgiveness was all about within 48 hours these family members these survivors were in a judicial courtroom they looked at the perpetrator and one after the other looked at him and said i forgive you well i am appreciative of my constituents for forgiving but i believe as their representative here in this body it is incumbent upon me to do whatever i canand hopefully we will be joined by others in this bodyto close this loophole lets make sure that gun purchases are not made until the background check is completed if it takes 4 days or 5 days what is that all about what we must do is make sure that demented criminals and domestic abusers are not allowed to purchase guns because we

15 years the inspection and verification procedures against illicit plutonium production or uranium enrichment are airtight the questions that have been raised about inspection proceduresthe socalled

the restrictions will be eased we would still know instantly about any attempt to make bomb materials because the inspectors and the electronic and photographic surveillance will still be there the options available to a future president for stopping iran then would be better than the options available now if the deal is rejected because we would have more access instant intelligence and more knowledge of the iranian program the argument that if we reject the deal we can force iran back to the negotiating table and obtain a better deal is a fantasy it is not a viable alternative the other

of georgia doing a good job this bill will stop it if we pass this rule we will be able to have that debate finally the bill that makes me the proudest is our concurrent budget resolution my friends have lots to say about why it is this budget doesnt balance lets be clear i believe that they are wrong but what is more important in this discussion is that my friends dont want the budget to balance we had a free and open debate on this floor we considered every budget that any member of this chamber wanted to offer every single one an interesting thing happened every republican budget that was introduced balanced within 10 years and didnt raise taxes on hardworking americans every single budget the democrats introduced never balancednot in 10 years not in 20 years not in 100 yearsand every single one raised taxes on hardworking americans by trillions of dollars trillions of dollars in new taxes and it still didnt reach balance my friends i understand we have a fundamental disagreement about how this country ought to be run and i am glad that we have that debate here in this chamber we are a deliberative body i respect the opinions of my friends i do believe there is a common ground that we can come to but this is that common ground today for years the budget wasnt even passed in the united states senate much less try to bring it together so that the house and the senate are working off a single page of music for the first time since 1991 this chamber has done its job in concert with the senate it is no small thing far from being something to be criticized it is something to be celebrated i dont know where the votes are going to be conferencing something with the senate is hard i promise you that my bosses back home in georgia have a much more conservative view of the world than many of the folks do in the united states senate but guess what i dont get everything i want every day but what i get is an opportunity to come together to build that bridge of common ground and agreement that is the agreement we have before us todaynot my ideas not democratic ideas not republican ideas but collaborative housesenate ideasa budget for the federal government for the first time in 15 years i urge all of my colleagues take a look at this rule you will be proud take a look at the work of the hardworking people in the rules committee upstairsnine republicans four democrats getting together late in the evening trying to make the rules workyou will be proud every single democratic amendment was made in order on the regulatory integrity protection act the resolution of disapproval brought exactly as the home rule act intended last used by democrats to disapprove today used by this chamber and finally that budget brought only after every single members

country for our freedom for the freedom of so many others we are at a time in our history when we have enemies reporting that they are entering the united states that is confirmed by the director of the fbi and others in this administration as is now reported there are active isis elements in every state in the union some say well those who want to suspend bringing in syrian refugees wouldnt that be like telling the jews during world war ii they couldnt come to america actually it would be more like saying we are going to suspend bringing germanswe are going to keep bringing in german jews because clearly they are being persecuted we are going to try to save them from the holocaust but we are going to suspend bringing in those who appear to have similar backgrounds to the nazis because we are not sure who is nazi and who isnt can you imagine dealing with what france has dealt with after we welcomed with open arms nazis before and during world war ii if that had been the policy of the roosevelt administration thank god it wasnt but unfortunately jews were turned away before and during world war ii the president wants to continue bringing in refugees continue the mass migration of illegal aliens into the united states we have this report from yesterday by brandon darby and ildefonso ortiz they report on eight syrians being caught at the texas border in laredo yesterday the story says two federal agents operating under the umbrella of unitedstates customs and border protection are claiming that eight syrian illegal aliens attempted to enter texas from mexico in the laredo sector the federal agents spoke with breitbart texas on the condition of anonymity however a local president of the national border patrol council confirmed that laredo border patrol agents have been officially contacting the organization with concerns over reports from other federal agents about syrians illegally entering the country in the laredo sector the reports have caused a stir among the sectors border patrol agents the sources claimed that eight syrians were apprehended on monday november 16 2015 according to the sources the syrians were in two separate family units and were apprehended at the juarez lincoln bridge in laredo texas also known officially as port of entry 1 the president has also stated in recent daysits been played over and over as the president condemns republicans and conservatives and liberals and moderate americans across the specter of politics americans who are concerned about one thing the safety of their homeland the president comes out and condemns and he said when i hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person whos fleeing from a wartorn country is admitted thats shameful thats not american thats not who we are we dont have religious tests to our compassion it doesnt violate the rules of the house to point out when an elected official is ignorant it is a violation to insinuate some ill motive i am insinuating no ill motive i am stating that the president is completely ignorant of what our laws are because the law is very clear if you look at 8 unitedstatesc 1158and i need to tip the hat to andrew mccarthy i have got his article in front of me from yesterday from nationalreview com he points out that under federal law the executive branch is expressly required to take religion into account in determining who is granted asylum under the provision governing asylumand again that is 8 unitedstatesc section 1158 an alien applying for admission and this is the law must establish that religion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting that applicant now there are other potential reasons that can be given for establishing the persecution but religion is a very important one and we have always looked at that issue as being important if you are being persecuted for your religious beliefs in the world that is always historically american to look at that fact and determine yes there is a religious test and these people are being persecuted because of their religious beliefs and only if we look at their religion and whether or not that religion is being persecuted can we determine whether they are entitled to asylum so to answer the question that is raised by the ignorant statement by our president the truth is yes it is american it is the law we need to know what religion you are to determine whether or not you are being persecuted for your religion in another place and this is over from 8 unitedstatesc this is in section 1101 and this is the section regarding refugee status but to qualify the applicant must be a refugee as defined by federal law and then that definition is what is at section 1101 a 42 a the term refugee means a any person who is outside any country of such persons nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a wellfounded fear of persecution on account of religion religion is important to take into account in determining whether someone is truly a refugee it is american it is not shameful it is what we have done historically and that is why i would have a baloch minority in my office today talking to me about persecution against the baloch people in iran because as he says americans have traditionally been compassionate when people are being persecuted unfairly and we have and to take such persecution into account we look at whether religion is a factor in their persecution that is american it is recognized even in iran as being american and being unshamefulnot only not shameful but being to the glory and credit of the united states of america that we do care mr mccarthys article goes on he says in the case of this war the islamic state is undeniably persecuting christians it is doing so moreover as a matter of doctrine even those christians the islamic state does not kill it otherwise persecutes as called for by its construction of sharia observe for example the ongoing rape jihad and sexual slavery from my discussions when i have been in nigeria with the poor africans whose children have been kidnapped they explained it was only the daughters that were being kidnapped and that the school was attacked i asked was it attacked because it was a girls school and they dont want girls having education they said they dont want girls having education but that is not the reason they attacked it they attacked it because it was a christian school so these radical islamists associated with the islamic state they attack schools particularly christian schools and after they attack a christian school the nigerians explained they bring the children out and if they are boys they just go ahead and kill them immediately because they are christian boys and they dont want that to spread if however they are girls the nigerian africans who were victims of boko haram explained they dont kill them no but you couldnt really say they werent persecuted because they are kidnapped and they are kept strapped to beds and they are repeatedly raped until such time as they are sold into sexual slavery and this administration according to some in nigeria has said we may help you but you have got to adopt a samesex marriage provision or we are not going to be such help to you and as one nigerian bishop said to his deep credit our religious convictions are not for salenot to president obama not to anybody god bless them the same effort was made to push kenya into adopting samesex marriage laws against their religious beliefs in that country i was so proud of the kenyan president and i have heard other african leaders say they were so proud they were also proud in africa of the kenyan president not being intimidated by president obamas demand that they change their marriage laws to go against the teachings of the man whose profile is right up here above the main door to our gallerya man named moseswho said he was speaking for god and according to gods law a man shall leave his father and mother and a woman leave her home and the two will become one flesh that was to be marriage when jesus was asked about marriage and divorce he quoted moses perfectlythe man we have depicted up here in our house chamber he quoted moses perfectly a man shall leave his father and mother and a woman leave her home and the two will become one flesh and then he added to moses perfect quote and what god has joined together nobody put asunder anyway our president was in african in the past trying to push them into changing their laws but unfortunately for people in areas where radical islamists have reigned if you are a christian you are being persecuted for your religious beliefs and if you are a christian boy in a school that boko haram attacks they will most likely just shoot you kill you and if you are a girl they take you into sex slavery in all likelihood mccarthy goes on to the contrary the islamic state seeks to rule muslims not kill or persecute them i think that is a very important point mr mccarthy makes the radical islamists are not seeking to kill or persecute muslims like they are christians they are seeking to rule them mr mccarthy goes on obama prefers not to dwell on the distinction between the jihadist treatment of muslims on the one hand and of christians jews and other religious on the other hand because helike much of washingtoninhabits a world in which jihadists are not islamic and therefore have no common ground with other muslims notwithstanding that jihadists emerge whenever and wherever a population of shariaadherent muslims reaches critical mass while there is no question that isis will kill and persecute muslims whom it regards as apostates for refusing to adhere to its construction of islam it is abject idiocy to suggest that muslims are facing the same ubiquity and intensity of persecution as christians and it is down right dishonest to claim that taking such religious distinctions into account is not american let alone shameful how can something american law requires be not american and how can a national expression of compassion expressly aimed at alleviating persecution be shameful that is andrew mccarthy yesterday the nationalreview com the state department turns its back on syrian christians and other nonmuslim refugees is an article by nina shea november 2 she says over the past 5 years of syrias civil war the united states has admitted a grand total of 53 syrian christian refugees a lone yazidi and fewer than 10 druze bahais and zoroastrians combined that so few of the syrian refugees coming here are nonmuslim minorities is due to american reliance on a united nations refugee resettlement program that disproportionately excludes them past absolute totals of syrian refugees to the united states under this program were small but as the obama administration now ramps up refugee quotas by tens of thousands it would be unconscionable to continue with a process that has consistently forsaken some of the most defenseless and egregiously persecuted of those fleeing syria the gross underrepresentation of the nonmuslim communities in the numbers of syrian refugees into the unitedstates is reflected year after year in the state departments public records they show for example that while syrias largest nonmuslim groupchristians of the various catholic orthodox and protestant traditionsconstituted 10 percent of syrias population before the war they are only 2 6 percent of the 2 003 syrian refugees that the united states has accepted since then syrias christian population which before the war numbered 2 million has since 2011 been decimated by what pope francis described as religious genocide i want to insert at this point that i have been advised that this administration is now saying that the persecution of christians is not being deemed a genocide perhaps it is because this administration feels like if you are taking the young girls and putting them into sex slavery and you are not outright killing themyou are just raping them and putting them into sex slaverythen maybe that is not a genocide you are letting the girls live so maybe they are so callous that they would consider it is not genocide if you just rape and put these young girls who are christians or from christian families into sexual slavery this article from nina sea says clearly far more than a dozen members of syrias religious minorities should qualify as refugees under the legal definition of a refugee as someone with a wellfounded fear of persecution based on religion instead minorities have difficulty getting to step one in the u n process the religious terror that drove them from syria blocks their registering the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees is largely limited to collecting refugee applications and making resettlement referrals from its own camps and centersthe burden of feeding creates strong incentives for this practice in an email to me knox thames the state departments new special adviser for religious minorities wrote that many minorities have not entered the u n system because they are urban refugees that is because they live far from the remote u n camps and aid centers they lack the information and access to register and as is widely known many nonmuslim refugees try hard to avoid these camps the reason christians try to avoid these u n camps is that they are muslim in fact in this article it is pointed out according to british media a terrorist detector asserted that militants enter u n camps to assassinate and kidnap christians an american christian aid group reported that the u n camps are dangerous places where isis militias and gangs traffic in women and threaten men who refuse to swear allegiance to the caliphate such intimidation is also reportedly evident in migrant camps in europe leading the german police union to recommend separate shelters for christians and muslim migrant groups the article goes on to point out according to a recent unhcr posting 19 000 syrians picked straight from refugee camps in turkey lebanon and jordan have received u n approval and are awaiting resettlement in the united states in october president obama ordered their expedited admission without further action however only token numbers of nonmuslim minorities will be among those rescued george carey former archbishop of canterbury called it right about the christian refugees and his words equally apply to syrias other nonmuslim communities they are being left at the bottom of the heap there is an article from todd starnes november 18yesterdayentitled obama is importing muslims deporting christians well if this is true so much for his testthat we dont care about religious tests but this article says when individuals say we should have a religious test and that only christiansproven christians should be admittedthat is offensive and contrary to american values the president saidjust one day after he called such behavior unamerican but as todd starnes says what is offensive and contrary to american values is refusing to properly investigate those wanting to come to our nationespecially those coming from regions that are hotbeds of islamic extremism those of us who fear that islamic radicals might be lurking among the refugees have been called every name in the book bigots islamophobes and unamerican but the president says such prudence only further enflames the islamic jihadists the president warns that it is counterproductive and needs to stop the truth is i will insert parenthetically what has been a huge recruiting tool for isil isis and the islamic state has been american weakness and unwillingness to confront radical islam head up and call it what it is we found back when we were engaged in iraq that one of the big recruitments that was used by radical islamists is they would go back to 1979 and the fact that jimmy carter did not after they attacked our embassy and took over 5051 people or soas hostages we did basically nothing to them and they point out that we pulled out of beirut after our marines were killed there and they go out and point out the 1993 attack on the world trade center under bill clinton we really did nothing after that in response and after the uss cole was hit we basically did nothing effective and they go on to point out each time that america has been hit and we did nothing effective to counter the attack upon us that is the biggest recruiting element that isis or any radical islamist group has had when they can show that they have attacked and we have been weak and nothing has been shown to be less effective in responding to attacks against us against americans against christians against minority groups against moderate muslims then what has happened during this administration call george w bush what you will but the fact is the world knew that while he was president if you messed with america he would strike back that is what led qadhafi to abandon his nuclear efforts it led him to open up his doors you tell me what weapons i can keep he was afraid we were going to invade them next according to this article it says but the cold hard reality is that protestants catholics and jews arent the ones beheading people the lutherans and nazarenes arent gunning down young folks in concert venues nevertheless the president remains steadfast the muslims will come we dont have religious tests to our compassions he told journalists from high atop his soapbox but that is not entirely accurate last year the obama administration led a fierce legal battle to have a german christian family thrown out of the united states the romeikes fled their homeland in search of a nation where they could homeschool their children a judge initially granted them asylum believing they were escaping from religious persecution however the obama administration waged a fierce campaign against the romeike family demanding they be returned to germany the family lost court battle after court battle but at the eleventh hour the white house relented and begrudgingly let them stay but just a few months ago a federal immigration judge ordered a dozen iraqi christians deported from a facility in san diego an immigration customs enforcement spokesperson declined to tell the san diego union tribune why the iraqi christians were being sent back to their native land so the next time president obama wants to lecture the nation about religion maybe he could explain why his administration is importing muslims and deporting christians i realize that i just have a few minutes left our hearts our prayers and thoughts have been with the people of france and lebanon and russia victims of radical islamist attacks and anywhere they have been occurring brussels as well there is great irony on wednesday of last week the european union announced what it had been building to for some time in essence it announced it was declaring economic war on israel antisemitism has grown all over the european union to levels i never would have dreamed as a little boy would ever come back to germany where we read and studied about the holocaust and the persecution of jews not just in germany but around europe and there were other countries that actually assisted the germans there were people like george soros who was jewish that helped finger other jews i never thought we would get to the level of antisemitism where europe as a whole as a group would basically declare economic war against israel incredible how antisemitism has grown there and then within 48 hours of them declaring war

member mccollum are able to commit to work with me on this i do plan to withdraw this amendment and i appreciate the time to be able to share a few words with everybody about why this amendment is so important i want to say a few words about my amendment and the challenges facing people in my district in new mexico my amendment requires the bureau of indian affairs to report identify and adjudicate to landowners egress and ingress easements where they do not exist for landowners on land parcels adjudicated under the pueblo lands act of 1924 while this sounds like a complex issue it is a very simple issue and one that was created back in 1924 with the pueblo lands act this amendment is the result of an issue that is specific to the state of new mexico and the 1924 pueblo lands act in 1924 congress passed the pueblo lands act which established the pueblo lands board this board was tasked with adjudicating land claims to pueblo lands and it took about 6 years until 1930 for the board to adjudicate these claims between the pueblos and nontribal landowners for the last 80 years families have been able to buy homes and build homes pass land on from one generation to the next everything had been going well until recently when the bureau of indian affairs alleged a trespass on some of the county roads the county of santa fe which is a local government in the state of new mexico that provide egress and ingress to the nontribal residents now these residents have been given patents by the united states of america that is what the pueblo lands act did giving the clearest title to land ownership in the united states of america but as a result of the bia letter the title insurance companies in the state of new mexico began to refuse issuing title insurance now as we all know that complicates your ability to buy a home sell a home or even refinance a home so that way you can reroof a home in some instances some of the families were trying to refinance that home because of bills that they have incurred for healthcare purposes but because they are not able to get title to their home they are not able to do so these are families who have their entire savings in their homes like many of us across america these are families who have been saving up to build a home in a community where they grew up where their parents grew up where their grandparents grew up and now they are fortunate to have a piece of land there i want to share with you a paragraph from a constituent by the name of jeff archuleta that he sent to me he writes when i grew up and my wife and i started a family of our own it was easy for me to decide where i wanted to raise our boys i was fortunate enough to obtain an acre of land from my father i dont know exactly how long this parcel of land had been in my family but i can say that it was listed in the san idelfonso report of 1929 addressing land titles between the pueblo and nonpueblo residents this document references land that was in nonpueblo private landowners possession prior to the pueblo lands act of 1924 reference is also made to a spanish grant approved by congress december 22 1858 at the time of this report the land belonged to demetrio and catalina roybal they later deeded the land to one of their children my great uncle pedro roybal who went on to sell it to my father i worry that we need to address this issue but that this dispute is tearing at the fabric of our communities for more than 2 years now i have tried to get anyone from the bureau of indian affairs to provide assistance to me to provide a way to get this solved i have asked the bia for the process and any criteria they used to issue an alleged trespass and to share their antiquated database with the public i have asked for maps and historical documents that the bia considered nothing was produced i asked for the chainofcommand that was followed and the bias interpretation and understanding of the pueblo lands act of 1924 and the actions of the pueblo lands board nothing was produced i even asked the bia for information related to mediation services because the fabric of these communities are being torn apart that is why i felt compelled

operations first i would like to thank the gentleman from florida for his dedication and important work on this bill the number of train derailments and accidents in our local communities is a growing concern among my constituents and americans all across the country in the first 2 months of 2015 there were 18 amtrak accidents as well as recent oil train derailments in west virginia and in north dakota most recently an amtrak train crash in philadelphia killed eight people and injured dozens more in new jersey alone there are 2 400 miles of freight lines and over 1 000 passenger rail miles and we must ensure that these existing lines are operating safely so what do we have here my amendment fully funds the federal railroad administrations safety and operations account without increasing spending in the underlying bill the fras safety and operations account provides funding for the fras safety program activities related to passenger and freight railroads so how do we do this by reallocating a mere 4 percent of funding from capital investment grants we can fund the safe operation of our nations trains at the presidents requested levels we do not build a new section onto our house if our roof is caving in so we should not be adding on to these systems if they are caving in or failing so why are we funding new projects before we ensure that our current rail lines have enough dollars enough funding for their safety my amendment would simply prioritize safety and maintenance of our existing infrastructure over the ribboncutting ceremonies associated with system expansion in light of the recent upsurge in deadly rail accidents now is the time to adequately fund the safety and operations of our trains additionally with our rising national debt it is very important that we remain fiscally responsible and prioritize how we spend our constituents hardearned tax dollars that is why in conclusion my amendment does not increase spending but only prioritizes a commonsense directive and so i urge my colleagues to support my amendment to fund train safety and i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.014233112335205078, 0.5142331123352051, 0, "i rise today in

on the train while going between philadelphia and new york i would look to see the first glimpse i could catch of the twin towers now what you could see were not the twin towers but long tall billowing clouds of smoke that were going straight up and then were stretching down the jersey shore the twin towers had been replaced by the brutal glow of raging fires and of black billowing smoke

the beach for those who remember that movie nothing was moving the city at 33rd street and eighth avenue seemed completely emptyno people no cars no buses there was nothing moving as if it were completely depopulated to get home i had to call a friend to come pick me up when i went down to the world trade center the next morning the scene was absolutely horrible there was fire smoke debris twisted metal human remainstotal devastation yet even then there were signs of hope firefighters police emergency medical technicians ironworkers and construction workers of all types rushed to ground

appreciate that statement by the gentlewoman from massachusetts i do not disagree with anything she said and i think i said that a while ago that there absolutely is a legitimate federal claim from the middle of the river to the south bank that has been the case ever since 1803 the gentlewoman is exactly right in laying that out the problem is that the bureau of land management has said now the south bank is as much as a mile to the south of where it is because they refuse to follow the survey method that the supreme court mandated they have done these spot surveys the chairman mentioned it is not a question about the middle of the river to the south bank it is a question of where the south bank is in some cases it is a tremendous difference back and that is where they confiscate the land it is because their new interpretation of the south bank is far far away from the river as i say as much as a mile that is the issue that is the reason the only way to solve this is to have a professional survey define the south bank using the criteria set by the supreme court and then that decides it will there continue to be federal land between the south bank and the middle of the river
