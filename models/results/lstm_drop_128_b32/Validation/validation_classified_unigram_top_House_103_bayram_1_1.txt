states as was pointed out very brilliantly earlier is that those western lands are in fact federal lands they ought to be sold they should be sold in a way that makes them accessible to private

strictly there for one purpose and that was they were dilatory they were there to try to weaken the bill to inflame one segment of the population as opposed to the other not all but a large number of them were there were three i think substantial amendments that the house needs to debate that were presented to the rules committee by the minority these amendments were made in order this is a fair

the crime bill i think it is a national disgrace that we do not have a crime bill before this body today that we are not dealing with assault weapons that we are not dealing withcriminals who take 10 or 15 years for their sentences to be executed that we cannot deal with habeas corpus we had a bill that passed this house last year that said that if you are on death row you have one appeal and it must be done by a qualified lawyer and it must be done within a year we could not get it through the senate the reason these people stay on death row for as long as they do is because there are a lot of jailhouse lawyers other inmates that go to the law library and figure out how to file petitions we put an end to all this and i think that should be before the house i think a comprehensive crime bill should be before the house america is bleeding on its streets and let me say and it was mentioned it is not just washington dc it is not just los angeles ca it is not just new york city where all of this is happening i can remember in my part of the country years ago we thought the drug problem was confined to the major metropolitan area of this country but we soon learned much to our horror

going to look back all of us one of these days and will never be able to explain to our children why we did not have what it took to pass strong crime legislation and to pass the brady bill in 1993 if we do not do it we get upset as well as should when 17 or 18 marines get killed in somalia but we do not get upset when 60 people are killed every day in this country by handguns the brady bill is a

conference even necessary why do we not just send the senatepassed bill on to the president a conference is necessary and this resolution should be supported for two reasons first there are major philosophical differences in two provisions added to the brady bill by the senate one which permits licensed gun dealers to sell guns anywhere in the country rather than just in their state of residence and second a change in the definition of antique firearms to include any gun manufactured before 1919 i oppose both of those provisions in the senate bill and i think there are legitimate reasons why they do not belong in the brady bill however there are two provisions that the senate added that have not been properly drafted and which will have to be cleaned up in conference at best one is a requirement that the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms send every proposed regulation that they issue to all federal firearms u1censees before they go into effect the way this is drafted is that it is not just regulations relating to firearms but regulations relating to alcohol and tobacco and the other matters that come under the jurisdiction of the batf i do not think it is necessary for a mailing to go out even on firearms regulations that is not done by the licensing agency in most other license provisions on both the federal and state levels so that will have to be cleaned up second the senate added a provision to the brady bill that conditions states receiving grant funds for the computized instantcheck system on having a plan to report mental health records the way the senate has drafted this amendment is that the states get no funds for computerizing their criminal justice records until they have such a plan relative to mental health records most mental health records are sealed by court order and to get them unsealed is not an easy thing to do it may even require court hearings and notice given to everyone whose mental health records have been sealed to hold the train at the station on the computerization of the criminal justice records for all that to be done i do not think is in the best interests of getting the instantcheck system up and running which is something that is desired by both opponents and proponents of the brady bill so a conference is necessary and this proposed rule facilitates that conference i would hope that the rule would be adopted right now"], [0.0009056627750396729, 0.4990943372249603, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in support of h r 4801 the small business administration reauthorization act h r 4801 is our basic 3year reauthorization for the small business administration h r 4801 sets the program levels for the sbas various direct and guaranteed loan programs included in the bill are authorization levels for the major small business financial assistance programs such as the 7 a general business loan program the certified development company program and the small business investment company programs a major function of the sbais assisting small businesses in their quest for capital and these reauthorization levels are set to meet the anticipated demand through 1997 the majority of sba loan programs are run on a guaranteed basis giving the taxpayer the most bang for the buck for example the 7 a loan program the sbas flagship program will be authorized to guarantee over 9 billion in loans with an outlay of less than 250 million programs like this provide the vital capital assistance necessary to make small business the effective job creator that drives our economy a benefit that far outweighs the cost to the taxpayer h r 4801 also reauthorizes the counseling and assistance programs at the sba these programs like the small business development centers and score provide valuable affordable advice to small business men and women giving them access to experience and knowledge which might otherwise be hard to find in addition to reauthorizing programs h r 4801 also makes numerous improvements in several sba programs the committee has voted to establish new accredited and premier lender programs that will give the certified development companies more flexibility and discretion in their lending and reduce the impediments to their efforts to promote growth and job creations the committee has also increased the limits on the international tradl lending program to enable small business to access foreign markets and help expand our economy by expanding our markets the sba reauthorization bill removes a provision prohibiting the sba from adjusting the size standards for the five industries in the competitiveness demonstration program these industriesconstruction dredging waste removal architecture and engineering and ship repairhave been frozen at outdated size standards for several years as a result of the prohibition in addition we are granting theadministrator of the sba greater flexibility to try some new methods for determining proper small business size standards h r 4801 also offers a solution to the longstanding problem of debentureprepayment penalties in the 503 loan program i am pleased that the appropriators have found at least some of the funds necessary to alleviate this inequitable situation i ampleased that h r 4801 takes important steps to strengthen our efforts to assist small

federal agencies will work in concert with the private sector advisory entity the national womens business council together they will identify and take steps toward solving problems that act as barriers to the success of womenowned businesses finally this legislation instructs the office of advocacy at the sba to conduct a comprehensive study of the impact of federal regulation paperwork and taxes on small business this has been a growing concern both in congress and the small business community and i am glad that we are taking steps to address it this is a good bill the committee worked

amendment and i say that with an understanding of the gravity and importance of this problem the first duty of government is to protect the safety of its citizens and probably right along with that is the duty to protect the borders of the united states and to see that illegal immigration does not take place like many of my colleagues in the chamber i have been on the border many times the canadian border and i have been to places like miami where illegal immigration occurs and i have been on the border with mexico the truth is that we are not making a sufficient effort with the immigration service to make sure that illegal immigration does not take place perhaps we need to bring the immigration service bill back up on this floor hopefully it will come later in the year and we can have this discussion i am prepared and i think a lot of members are prepared to appropriate additional moneys to make sure that our borders are secure i am convinced that we can do a far better job than we are doing i stood at the border at tiajuana not long ago and i watched illegal immigration take place i talked to the immigration officers who were there and they said yes we could do a much better job but we are not prepared today to do it because we do not have the commitment of the unitedstates congress through funding sources to make possible what needs to be done i think this amendment is

into a school let us check on people who want to do all manner of things that government agencies that are outside the immigration service are not prepared to do it does not make sense to turn every school and every school official in the country into an immigration officer that is not their job they are not prepared to do it they do not have the equipment to do it they do not have the personnel to do it they do not have the time to do it they do not have the ability to do it correctly so let us please not burden every piece of legislation that comes through here with an added responsibility to enforce the immigration laws of this country let us get the immigration laws enforced by the immigration service and by the border patrol i was told by our immigration officers that earlier last year when the mexican government and our government got more serious about illegal immigration for about a 2month period illegal immigration dropped precipitously it can be done but let us do it in the right place and let us have this discussion on an immigration bill that comes before this house and let us keep the responsibility where it belongs not in the schools and not in the training

hours to get this bill to the floor from the minority michelle mrdeza and christie cohen should be congratulated for their work this is a responsible bill it stays within the limits of the budget act within the 602 b allocation allowed by the appropriations committee and it is less than 1 percent above the fiscal year 1993 level specifically this bill contains a number of important provisions which help federal workers and their families two of which i want to highlight here today the first ever federal government telecommuting center is expected to open on september 7 in winchester va the telecommuting centers in which federal government employees who normally commute long distances to reach their jobs in the washington area would be able to instead work 1 or 2 days a week at a federal facility nearby their home workstations with computers and telephones will be set up to allow these workers to perform their jobs closer to their homes closer to their families it also cuts down on rush hour congestion and on pollution chairman hoyfr and i have worked very hard to bring this concept to reality and i am pleased that two telecommuting pilot projects will soon be open this bill also contains a provision i authorized which allows federal government employees to use accrued sick leave for the adoption of a child right now federal employees may use sick leave for the natural birth of child but not for adoption purposes this new provision would give adoptive parents the same option as other new parents two years ago my amendment created a 1year government pilot project for adoptive parents was highly successful with many families participating unfortunately i understand that the adoption language may be stricken on a point of order for legislation on an appropriations bill that is very frustrating to me adoption of a child is one of the greatest moments in the lives of many americans and if a parent misses the opportunity to spend time with his or her newly adopted

middle class lower who or whatever class we want to refer to paying for local educational agencies to determine the number of students enrolled who are not lawfully in the united states i am quoting from the rohrabacher amendment how do they propose to do that well they do not tell us that not in this amendment what do you reckon that your local school district is going to have to do well they
