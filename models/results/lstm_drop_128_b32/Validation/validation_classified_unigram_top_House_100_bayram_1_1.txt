amendments to h r 3097 h r 3097 is primarily a reauthorization of the national organ transplant act of 1984 the 1984 act passed the house by a vote of 398 to 6 this bill passed the house last year on the suspension calendar it just recently passed the senate with an amendment as it passed the house h r 3097 had three objectives first it would extend the 1984 act for 3 years second it would improve the grant program for communitybased organ procurement organizations and the organ procurement and transplantation network which is responsible for matching donated organs with needy patients third it would establish a national registry for voluntary donors of bone marrow bone marrow transplants are now recognized as the treatment of choice for certain diseases particularly among children the navys office of research has developed such a donor registry and is currently making arrangements to transfer it to the national institutes of health the senate amendment did not revise any of these provisions in h n 3097 it did add two other provisions one clarifies that the provision in the 1984 act which prohibits the buying and selling of organs is specifically applicable to fetal organs the other would authorize a grant program to enable states to provide immunosuppressive drugs to transplant patients who are not eligible for medicare medicaid or private insurance coverage this resolution would make technical and clarifying amendments in the bill as passed by the senate we have discused these changes with the senate and they have agreed to them several members made valuable

to make a brief statement today on central america because i think that there is a unique window of opportunity right now for this country to start again to construct a road tc peace in that region as part of this effort 2 weeks ago the gentleman from michigan mr crockett chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs and i introduced house concurrent resolution 146 to applaud the arias peace initiative this resolution is similar to that passed by the senate on march 12 1987 by a nearly unanimous vote of 971 hearings on our resolution will be held tomorrow and next week the timing of this resolution of support even more than its wording is significant because of the postponement 2 weeks ago of the central american summit and the general assumption that the arias initiative appears to be faltering empty words of support for that vital effort to end armed conflict in central america are not enough we must put some substance behind our rhetoric so that other nations in the world understand that we are sincere in supporting efforts toward peace we must reevaluate our policies in central america and ask ourselves whether they are furthering peace or war do we truly desire a negotiated settlement or does this country really prefer a military solution construction of this road to peace will never begin unless the united states is willing to stop military aid to the nicaraguan contras it is time to realize that our policies in central america have helped the sandinistas more than they have hurt them and have hurt this country more than they have helped in reaching our objectives at first we were told that aid to the contras was designed to stop arms shipments going from nicaraguan to the rebels in el salvador but when the nicaraguans reduced aid to the salavadoran rebels in early 1981 the administration responded that the revised objectives were to place pressure on the sandinistas for a negotiated settlement that remains the official goal as i understand it as time went on however it became apparent that the purpose in aiding the contras was really to overthrow the sandinista government in fact president reagan with uncharacteristic candor in an interview last august stated if nicaragua wont see the light then the only alternative is for the freedom fighters to have their way and take over which the presidents spokesman subsequently called an ulp timate goal but it has become more and more apparent with the passage of time that this war is unwinnable by the contras and most everybody agrees that this is true the presidents of all four central american democracies have so stated in my presence the question i would like answered is how sincere is the administration in its officially stated goal to assist in a negotiated settlement former ambassador to honduras john ferch a long time backer of the administrations policies in nicaragua stated last year i always thought we meant what we said we wanted pressures so we could negotiate im beginning to think i accepted something that wasnt true our goal is something different its a military goal where has our contra policy led us have we stopped arms shipments to the salvadoran rebels has the sandinista government been overthrown has it become more humane has our bargaining chip helped to achieve peace have the contras with our support won any military objective the answer is no in fact our policies have almost certainly had the reverse effect to gain perspective here it is important to recall that the united states stands alone in the world in militarily supporting the contras in fact none of our allies even agrees with our policy that fact alone should cause us to question its correctnessthis policy which has led us to violate international law and to ignore the international justice system why is it that we have not learned from our experience in vietnam that ambivalent american unilateral efforts at military solutions are doomed to failure one must question the morality of our contrinued support of the contras during my 4day trip last february to the region costa rican president oscar arias sanchez asked our congressional delegation this key question if the contras have no chance of winning then is it not immoral to give them aid to carry on their fight isnt it immoral to send men to nicaragua to kill and be killed in an unwinnable war that is the question that i kept asking myself as i talked with the 15yearold contra revolutionary in honduras he was certain this boy soldier that with american support his life was not in danger and they would throw the sandinistas out this young guerrilla fighter a mere boy and i emphasize mere genuinely believed that his rag tag group of at most 17 000 contras could defeat the 62 000 man sandinista army yet the contras do not have the apparent support of the nicaraguan countryside they have not won the hearts and the minds of the nicaraguan people nevertheless these men these good basically decent naive peasant fighting troops were convinced they could win the war because of one thing their powerful northern yankee neighbor was on their side one must further question the morality or more appropriately the immorality of recent cia actions newspapers in march reported that the cia was providing the contras with precise information on dams bridges electrical substations and ports and counseling them in sabotage methods so that the contras could destroy those vital facilities imagine that the very projects constructed in the 1960s and 1970s by a benevolent wellintentioned american army corps of engineers to help these impoverished people provide for their food and water and electricity needs these same projects are now 10 years later to be destroyed sacrificed to help politically destabilize that region of nicaragua all this under the direction of the same american government that built them in the first place do you think the nicaraguan peasants understand that maneuver can any defensible american goal be furthered by that course of action reason and justice are turned upside down judgement william shakespeare quotes mark antony as saying millenia ago oh judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason in january 1983 columbia mexico panama and venezuela met on the island of contadora in panama to begin to build a foundation toward peace as international support for the contadora initiative grew the united states consistently showed support for the process while warning that nicaragua would never agree as final drafts were distributed we learned that the nicaraguan government was in fact ready to sign and just as suddenly the unitedstates support for the contadoran initiative disappeared and american diplomats methodically began to undermine this balanced plan for peace the reagan administration in 1985 and 1986 in fact conducted a secret campaign in latin america to scuttle the contadora peace talks a number of carefully documented news stories and thoughtful articles including a secret national security council paper published by the washington post provide strong evidence of that point the administration had misled the public and congress into believing it supported contadoras efforts at peace while secretly blocking the peace initiative the administration was successful talks have been totally stalled since june of last year last february a new shortened set of proposed principles for a settlement of armed conflicts in central america was proposed to a central american summit conference by costa rican president arias leaders of central americas four democracies made positive steps toward agreeing on that formula for peace while they did not agree on the specific plan they did sign the preamble as a sign of support and agreed to meet in esquipulas guatemala 4 months later nicaragua which was not invited to the february meeting accepted an invitation to meet in june astoundingly the political leadership of the nicaraguan contras themselves supported the arias initiative the united states indicated an initial interest and still publicly expresses limited support but increasingly has given the impression that it is interfering and trying to stall the central american peace efforts two weeks ago for example which was 1 week before the scheduled summit and 1 day after united states ambassador phillip habibs visit to el salvador president duarte asked to postpone the planned summit just a few days later the administration summoned president arias to washington and sharply criticized his proposal president arias and his fellow central american presidents have all along been paving the way toward peace taking the lead after the united states effectively stalled the contadora talks now these leaders appear a little discouraged i think we should be applauding and encouraging their efforts toward a negotiated settlementnot blocking them we should let the central american nations determine their own destiny so long as our own security is not threatened we have no moral right to interfere with that process the administration has criticized the arias proposal as being too lenient on the sandinistas the administration fears that if united states aid to the contras stops the nicaraguan government will not implement democratic reforms notwithstanding the terms of the settlement yet let me point out that the civil war with the contras and americas support to the contras are the sole excuses that the nicaraguan government had used to justify suppressing basic democratic rights and no one should pretend in my view that the sandinista government is genuinely less dictatorial nor substantively more democratic than its predecessor though many americans will not agree with me on that point genuine abuses by bothsides are abundantly documented do you think that the nicaraguan peasant who is subjected to inhumane treatment by the sandinista government and remembers comparable atrocities by the somozan government while today witnessing similar contra abuses genuinely cares who wins the fight will he prefer an authoritarian government of the political right to one of the political left through the arias plan withdrawal of united states aid to the contras will put the nicaraguan government to the test we will find out if it is sincere about bringing about these democratic reforms if it does not abide by the agreement the united states gives up none of its present options including the military ones the contras will continue their struggle at least initially they survived for years without american assistance we will also then be joined by the rest of the free world in pressuring the nicaraguan government to abide by the agreements terms this is much to be preferred to our current position of opposing the rest of the world in militarily assisting the contras there are no ideal options in central america there are only gradations of unappealing choices the arias plan in my opinion is not perfect while it would require democratic reforms and arms reductions it does not contain the stronger provision of the contadora principles requiring the withdrawal of soviet union assistance from nicaragua nor contra participation in the negotiating process i wish it did but we must realize that the failure of the contadora process changed the negotiating landscape in central america the arias plan is the first step and only apparent hope for a negotiated settlement of the armed conflict if the sandinista government does not implement the arias provisions of arms reductions democratic reforms and an end to the armed conflict in nicaragua they will be exposed before the world as liars isolated by free world public opinion and pressure will increase for compliance the imperative now is to bring the central american nations to the negotiating table and the arias initiative is the stimulus to start that peace process will this country support a negotiated settlement to the armed conflicts in nicaragua and central america or will we continue to seek a military solution i am confident that the congress will insist on the peace process of negotiation among the central american parties themselves"], [0.44187498092651367, 0.5581250190734863, 1, "this resolution provides as the gentleman from michigan just

existing oil price crisis that has brought many small and mediumsized unitedstates oil producers into the nightmare of bankruptcy with the producers failure the myriad of contractors subcontractors equipment suppliers marketers and so forth come tumbling down as well unitedstates oil like farm products is defenseless if left to the wolves out there there is no such thing as a free market hand

call for federal action to defend our domestic oil producers against the world why because over 75 percent of the available oil in the worid today is owned or managed by other governments it is not owned nor managed by private commercial interests even more so than agriculture oil lives in a trading world fully dominated by political entities who control price and productionmuch to our own disadvantage some people say well who cares about opec and their pricing schemesthere is over 700 billion barrels of oil yet to be drilled from the earth the frightening truth is that since the first

roles for the federal government to fulfill besides simply national defense then we might proceed to synchronize our national efforts on taxation consumer use and production stability into a coherent policy designed to keep the unitedstates oil producers producing lets face it we cant produce oil for less than 20 a barrel maybe opec can do itbut we cant and the sooner we accept that fact of life

points about the national guard and reserve and i would like to further cover those points and point out that 55 percent of all the combat missions of the army now are in the army national guard they have more tank battalions more infantry battalions and more artillery battalions than the regular army the air guard which has done a tremendous job of protecting the continental limits of the united states of over 75 percent of the missions to protect aircraft coming into the air lanes of the united states i failed to mention that the top gun pilot or aviator in the country is an air reservist who recently won the william tell contest that is held out in the far west this air reservist was recognized as the top pilot in the world flying f16s and i thought my colleagues would like to know that information that we are totally dependent on our reserve forces and the national guard as far as incentives are concerned the reservists are doing well at this time they get enlistment and reenlistment bonuses the air guard now is increasing by 20 percent reenlistmerts over last year and part of that is the reenlistment bonus and part of that is the new peacetime gi bill which was passed in this congress 3 years ago these young men in the air guard air reserve have to sign up for 6 years and then they are eligible for the gi peacetime bill as i said it is bringing in and keeping the quality in the reserves the air guard has increased reenlistments by 20 percent over 1986 and 1987 marine reserve is having success in their reservists they used to have a big turnover of young men and women coming into the marine reserve they just could not keep them in the service or keep them in the reserve but that has changed now of those that come in there was maybe 50 percent of them who would complete their 3 or 6year enlistment and now well over 60 percent of the marine reservists complete their reserve obligation and those figures hold as well for the national guard and for the army reserve i think that in the near future we will have some amendments to the peacetime gi bill they are not costly these amendments have been voted out by the committee on veterans affairs and they witl come to the committee on armed services in the near future some members are interested that in the active forces you have to put up 100 a month for 12 months and this 1 200 goes to receiving 10 800 for the regular service personnel who sign up for the gi bill some of these young men and women have lost their lives who put up the 1 200 and under the law their estates are not able

on housing and community development which i have the honor of chairing messrs kennedy garcia hubard flake ms pelosi and m taaficant as cosponsors so today i would entitle the remarks that i wish to address to my colleagues as they leave for the july 4 district work periodand i hope will give careful study and reading to the record when it is printed tonight becausa i believe it is the first of several programs that i will be offeringthis one i would call a bill of rights for the american homeowner and leaseholder or renter america has had very serious and vast transformations in what the students of the subject matter call demographics that is compared to three four decades ago our families are much smaller the population of our country has increased quite a bit geometrically since the 1930s and the initiation then of the programs that the national leaders and congress got together to meet the crisis of that day unfortunately for us it seems as if we have to wait here until the crisis is on us and we are floundering and hopefully that will not happen but i am afraid as i have spoken previously in the remarks i have entitled my advice to the privileged orders well i finished that which was a course of discussion for at least 21 2 years mostly it was outlining as has not been done in discussion or debate the very braic fundamental challenges american society has confronted since its founding it is ironic as i have said previously in these advice to the special or privileged classes that here as we are about to celebrate the 200th anniversary next year in march 1989 this form of government that is the constitution which is the fundamental law of the land which sets forth the governmental structure we have not celebrated 200 years yet we celebrated the 200th anniversary of the declaration of independence the struggle of the revolutionary war in 1976 but since then and last year i am afraid so many of us thought that celebrating the writing of the constitution was equivalent with celebrating the bicentetmial of our government and that is not so the constitution was finally completed in september 1787 but then it took some time to sell it to the majority of the states or the colonies and by the time it was ready to be implemented it was not until march 3 only god and destiny can tell us whether we will be able and fortunate enough to say on march 3 1989 next year that we can still boastfully say that the system is operated as we have always conceived it to be we have grave dangers some of them glossed over but which inescapably we will have to confront that go to the heart of the matter that is whether our system based on a balancing of powers is really going to survive so today the real question is whether we in our time will have the faith in the american people as those leaders in congress did during the grave emergencies of the denression and war and up to now i am afraid we have become fat and complacent and in many ways arrogant this as i have said in my remarks addressing generally the extent size variety and complexity of these problems is what shakespeare wrote all about when he said when a people become complacent and proud and arrogant and the gods seal their eyes to their defects they soon are unk in their processes of destruction and in his words strutting laughing at by those watching these proud and arrogant complacent people strut it is true that prosperity and wellbeing do tend to make a people forget the struggles and ardor of those struggles that gained them liberty and selfgovernment the 20th century has been hostile to selfgovernment not friendly yet we survive but only because the people were faithfully led and it was faith and the discharge of that faith mutually by those people elected as their agents which under our system is the vital part if it is functioning and to the extent it does not function to that extent we are in serious trouble to that extent we have become victims of the consequences of these misgotten and foolish leaders demagogic and ignorant and blissfully unaware of the limitations of the powers the constitution sets forth but to which congresses have rather complacently sometimes supinely submitted without challenge and this means that that faith is not being kept by the agents of the people who as they are under the constitution are the source of all power so as i say this is the time to have a bill of rights for the american homeowner that means the spinal column of our country the vital essence of our society the newly married couple that decides to have their own little nest and have their family that is the bulwark of our strength but in the last 6 years it has become an empty dream we have brought these things out in endless hearings that we have had here in washington and also in historic hearings pioneering hearings out in the field in the country and in the densely urbanized areas of our country from the south bronx to philadel phia and south to our nations capital and then from detroit to california where we find a newer land a newer people so to speak and they confront a different set of problems but nevertheless just as vexing and complex in their extent as those facing the older sections of our country and the older housing stocks but around our ears more than housing is collapsing around us because a house does not stand isolated and alone it has to have a water supply drainage sewage and streets that is what is known as the infrastructure and that is collapsing around our ears i have reminded my colleagues on this subcommittee that we cannot talk just about housing this is all we have been doing but we have got to remember that we should not forget that other half of the descriptive phrase of our subcommittee and that is comminity development every day in the city of new york this vast steaming metropolis more water is wasted each day than is consumed this is the precious substance that is the essence of lifewater why is that well partly because they have such outmoded systems as wooden pipes or delivery systems so they are having a tremendous waste the resources of the city of new york alone are inadequate to confront that problem every other day in our country a bridge collapses when it happens out in some outoftheway place nobody cares that it happens in new york city when it is a very vital link in transportation yes we care but what are the resources of those entities that try to firm up this infrastructure that is crumbling around our ears we have had five communities all in new england that have had their water systems collapse overnight this is happening at a time when the federal administration in power withdraws the commitment the federal government has to such things as this were it not for our subcommittee and the majority members of both the house and the senate most of the time the presidents budget since the beginning in 1981 would have zeroed everything out as they have done in housing for instance this administration has reduced by 80 percent the allocation of credit for housing or assisted housing as we call it well we cannot have a nation that is still dynamic and still growing straitjacketed and not expect to have problems so today i have introduced what will be known as h r 4959 which in effect will reaffirm our commitment to a national housing promise i started to say that just about 01 percent of our american families today can afford to buy a new singlefamily dwelling unit the average national index of cost is so prohibitive that no more than 61 2 percent of the american people can afford to buy a brandnew spanking newly constructed home this is not good we have now as our subcommittee first pointed out on december 4 1982 a considerable segment of our american people rootless homeless and wandering our country as refugees do in other lands that is not allowable for us in america but what is the reason for this well i brought this out before in an endless number of specific remarks that i have made showing the root causes the development of these causes and their contributing factors as to why we got to this point why is it that as of 3 a years ago america is a debtor nation for the first time since 1914 it is basically for the same reason that for a substantial number of americans we are houseless and homeless there was a time when we had presidents who cared we had franklin roosevelt at the height of the depression when everybody was broke and the treasury was broke and yet he and the congresses had faith in the american people that is the backbone of the american people the home occupant the homeowner a little family trying to hold itself together the only thing that anchors down a family to its country and its soil is a home now what did they do did they say oh well no we cant do it because of the budget deficiency did they say no we cant do that no they started such programs as the holc the home owners loan corporation and they heard then the same voices we are hearing now from those who are in power today saying you cant do that because it will be abused it is a waste of money and you dont have the money what are you going to do lend borrowed money no they went on ahead and did it and when the program closed out the bulk of the american families that owned homes that were threatened with foreclosure saved their homes ard when the program closed out at just about the time the war was going to break out it brought in 400 million to the unitedstates treasury now 400 million in 1940 would be like several billion today this was what having faith in that substantial strength of america meant today we have seen what happened with the federal reserve board and its previous chairman when i introduced an impeachment resolution against him i had a lot of criticism and everybody thought i was publicity seeking well i was in dead earnest because the substance of america had been sold down the river for which we arc paying now and for which we still have to get the full bill of accounting but when i saw that this same powerful chairman who was going to dictate the fiscal and monetary policies and therefore the economic policy of the congress met in secret with the head of the first national city bank of new york walter wriston and h l bunker hunt the billionaire from texas who thought he was so smart that by using over 35 billion dollars worth of lank credit allocations he could go over and compete with those old european speculators and corner the silver market and he lost his pants and all that bank crediti knew something was going to iappen they had that secret meeting the banks met to see how they could rescue him they were willing to allocate as they continue to do vast segments of amerlean credit resources banking resources everybody has forgotten what banks are the congresses are not here to do the bidding of the bankers but one would not think so sitting in on the hearings of the banking committee and other places banks are chartered or are supposed to be for public need and convenience but they have become the most powerful entities in our society they determine our coinage i have brought that out before in this bill h r 4959 i am saying all this and the descriptive introductory clause of the bill is this to establish a national housing trust to assist firsttime home buyers now what do we mean by firsttime home buyers and how do we define them we set up this trust and how is it going to be administered well we are not going to have the federal reserve board as members of the trust of the secretary of hud under whose aegis we would have it administered through fha we will have the savings and loan institutions that are today as dead as a doornail at risk right now is the insurance fund not only for the s ls but for the banks too because fdic is headed that way what do we do sit here and wait until this crisis engulfs us to the point where everything is lost that is the real danger to this country not a fnreign invasion we inside the united states face this danger so all this does is say look fellows just bring that jam from up on that top shelf where only the h l bunker hunts and all those guys are able to get it and bring it down here where the common folk can reach it they will know what to do that is all so we allocate a national credit allocation of 6 billion to be apportioned over a period of 3 years through the trust fund it is going to be a trust fund and it cannot be used for any other purpose eligible will be those families whose median income does not exceed 115 percent of the median average in that area and who have not bcen homeowners in the immediate past 3 years we are targeting these brandnew wouldbe homeowners who could own their own homes if given a little help we cap interest rates at 6 percent and that is the nub of the matter the s ls in the state of texas are dead even the stronger ones are losing money they may not be bankrupt but nobody can stay in business if they keep losing money and we have had a record number of bank closings already since january 1 everybody might think that this is a texas phenomenon let me assure my colleagues that this is a national problem all throughoul the nation these institutions are in trouble now do we want to sit here and say at no time will i allow the taxpayers money to be used as a rescue that is not the issue the issue is are we going to sit here and wait until the insurance fund is bankrupt and we cannot pay the insirance on the covered and insured depositors or account holders we will be yelling to ball them out but by then we are in crisis and we would not be thinking right let us do this now and we will save the s ls this mechanism that i would use here will actually administer it and this new wouldbe home buyer will go to an s l that will have and will be enabled to keep a home mortgage portfolio as they were intended to be functioning when they were founded so all i am sayng is nothing i am not doing anything radical i am just bringing good oldfash oned oldtime religion which worked back into the system by just bringing it back and giving the people that priceless allocation of credit resources for one of the musts in human existence which is shelter everywhere throughout the globe n human existence a person has got to have three basic things and shelter is one of them i firmly believe and so do the colleagues that have signed on with me these are all responsible hardworking very knowledgeable members of the subcommittee on housing and banking the mechanism is to affirm our faith in those institutions that worked until they strayed from the basics s ls were founded specifically by the congress because a framework is needed of financial institutional reference to create the credit so that one can have a homebuilder build at an affordable cost that he can sell at an affordable rate and stabilize that mortgage by making it a 30year stretchout with a fixed stable rate of interest as i have said since the day i came to the congress and that was 27 years ago when nobody gave a hoot or a gehinny because who would think that it was legal to charge over 10percent interest in fact today most everyone i talk to in and out of congress knows that there are laws protecting against usury let me say there arent and i pointed that out when i got here the first month i got here i came from texas where the texas state senate had just defeated an attempt to get the small borrower in the clutches of the loan shark and i saw those tracks coming up here to the nations capital but i never dreamed that beast would take over and it has there are no protections and there have not been any since 1865 when abraham lincoln had just been killed and the congress passed the national currency act which set up the first framework roughly of the national banking system and abolished the usury law and nothing this is why a person cannot get 10 percent not 11 percent not 15 percent but 21 percent prime interest rates in 1980 and 1981 no nation as i have said ad nauseum hera in the history of known mankinds activity can endure with extortionist rates of interest otherwise known as usury no civilization the history of interest rates parallels the rise and the fall of vast empires this is why we are floundering and we are addressing it here by capping it and saying no more than 6 percent for 30 years and we will have the real resources of this nation we have the secondary mortgage institutions we will bring them into the trust fnma well what are these institutions they have the best of two worlds they are supposed to be semiprivate or quasiprivate but my gosh my colleagues ought to see the salaries the officers get and they are living off of what well it has to be off of the primary market if we have an uithealthy or a broke primary market how can the secondary market be any good this seems to escape all of our refined economists and financiers and all and what we have had is rampant unrestrained greed because all through mankinds history one of the reasons governments have been founded has been to control that so when we take the top away from the corner we should not be surprised and we should not be wringing our hands and shedding tears and gnashing our teeth what else was to be expected the congress helped with the passage of two fundamental acts in 1980 and 1982 i was against both i was the only one i might say so i do not know the only cedentials i have to show whether i was right or wrong is what is happening now the realities of a broken down savings and loan system a floundering financial institution it would not take much we are now dependent upon forces external to our shores as to what we can do or cannot do or what will happen to us because we have been living off of foreign borrowed money and i am convinced that no matter how magnanimous no matter how generous no banker is in the charity business whether he is dealing with the government or anybody else and concomitant with that has been the unanswered questions that i have been raising since the middle and the lat sixties with the first credit crunch of 1966 in june and that is how come president franklin roosevelt and also in the sequela war known as the korean war president truman to wage war borrowed money as they had to as a matter of fact here in world war ii as i said before on the federal level we were using 46 percent of our total gross national product on the federal level to prosecute and win the war but roosevelt and the administration never had to pay even 2 per cent on an average to service the debt truman neither but now as much as 14 percent on treasury tbills all of this travail that the congress went there on this abomination known as the grammrudmanholllngs to balance the budget in 1991 they said i call it grammbo legislation because it was so violative of the constitution that the supreme court knocked out half of it half of the original grammrudmanhollings as some of us predicted all right the first year that is the year before last on march 15 grammrudmanhollings was supposed to announce a savings that is a reduction of the national debt of 15 billion but what they did not announce is that that same day the interest charges to service that debt rose 30 bhuon oh how are we going to balance the budget if we are cutting this and saving that but we are paying more over here twice as much as was said would be saved anybody can tell you that any grammar school child can tell you that that kind of arithmetic is a declining arithmetic it is not an addition it is a subtraction so who is worried about how the system was changed and in what manner in servicing the debt as i am talking here just this day we will be dishing out way over 500 million on interest by definition interest is the most inflationary economic factor known to man because it is something for nothing this is exactly why ancient civilizations prohibited it by penalty of death as the lord jesus christ was preaching the law of that land was that interest and usury were punishable by death so all through history it has been regulated we talk about the japanese competition yes and what i am doing here is what i told the mortgage bankers 4 years ago i had just met with two members of the japanese diet bril liant fellows who were members of the housing component of the diet and two japanese industrialists in construction they were evaluating the american market and they showed me how they were ready to come in and they could set up a single family dwelling unit at 10 000 finance it at no more than 7 percent and i told the mortgage banker i said youre going to have the same thing happen among you fellows because of your accustomed uncontrolled greed as happened to our automobile manufacturers youre going to be invaded and displaced well up to now that has not happened only because there have been some factors there that have contributed to that not happening but i said you gentleman arent going to tell me that we in america dont have the wit and the will to do the same thing and even do it cheaper at 6 percent its just a fact that youre all on a big joyride even more so now within several money manias your real estate investment trusts your collateral money manias they were beginning to see at that point some of the insidious effects of the socalled money market uninsured which today is a time bomb ticking when i asked the new chairman of the federal reserve board mr greenspan last autumn in his first appearance before a committee i said sir what do you intend to do with that 221a percent of that financial segment thats insured that grew up in this mutual money market and he said nothing well to me and i ari no expert it seems like that is a time bomb ticking and sooaer or later it is going to have to be addressed now the congress did not do anything when that was developing because it regulated the banks they were under regulation to the extent they could be but these money market funds were sucking out the technical word disintermediating the other financial institutions that is sucking money out from them in order to go to these highyielding mutuals or rather money markets and this is what is happening now in texas the regulator that did not regulate when he should hav is now trying to piece the parts together stitch them together but what are they doing they are a fiction of the imagination they are dead as a door nail but they are offering high yields 9 9 percent naturally when they see fslic deposits or whatever you want to call them are insured up to 100 000 that is a big selling point and the others the regular plotting institutions cannot pay that high yield so they are going to see their funds subtracted and that is what is happening but the institution is as dead as a door nail what is going to happen when the day of reckoning hits and that insurance fund is not there to meet the protection that has been promised by the government that is what i want to know that is when i want to ask my colleagues who tell me today oh no never taxpayers money i want them to tell me in a few months whether they are

another reason that the midgetman system is more vulnerable and therefore is a better system and that is because it can survive in a defensive environment the amendment is really a test of the sincerity and consistency of those who believe that in the next decade we and our adversaries may indeed have deployed strategic defense systems the best response to strategic defenses to boost phase interceptors and postboost phase interceptors is to cut down the operating time for the boost and for the postboost phases this system a singlewarhead system carries the capability of reducing these phases to a far greater extent than the mx missile at 190 000 pounds with 10 warheads in the postboost phase alone this system can probably offload its reentry vehicles in 1 to 11 2 minutes the actual number is classified but there are estimates recently published by lawrence livermore laboratory to the effect that our systems can offload rvs somewhere around at 45 seconds again that is an estimated number i am not revealing anything classified this midgetman system with two warheads would offload its rvs in 45 seconds to 1 2 minutes as opposed to possibly 7 minutes for the postboost phase of an mx missile that makes the midgetman superior not o liy because of its mobility and the fact that it presents 250 missiles to target in the postboost phase but also because in the postboost phase its of fload and its rvs faster therefore the midgetman is much more survivable in the world that some project toward the end of the next decade when strategic defenses may be factored into the strategic equation this is another reason to vote for the mavroules amendment and support the midgetman unitedstates mobility and dispersion will not only make it more survivable versus the ss18 and

should be a test ban moratorium and the reason they have decided that is that they have given the president over 6 years and there has been no progress on this issue every other president from

impediment to the suecess of the hearing impaired and guarantee that they have equal access to the unitedstates telephone network at present there are many times often when it matters the most that a hearing impaired person simply camot use the telephone imagine not being able to call home from a friends house or use the phone in someone elses office or even to call 911 outside your own home in an

no longer a luxury item it is an essential part of our everyday lives our link to the rest of the world and vital to our business and social success as well ironically since the deregulation of the telephone equipment industry which promised to bring the wonders of modern telecommunications to all americans the percentage of telephones the hearing impaired can use has gone down significantly h r

or imported 1 year after enactment of this act be hearing aid compatible the legislation cxempts a few specialized applications such as mobile services and phones used for national security purposes further ii r 2213 is written to insure that it will not freeze todays technology and inhibit future innovation and development the bill only requires that phones be compatible it does not mandate any particular type of technology this legislation will keep pace with the dynamic fastchanging telecommunications and hearing aid technology fortunately it is very easy to make every telephone accessible to the hearing impaired person a simple virtually costless copper wire located in the telephone hand set creates an electromagnetic field which a telecoil in a hearing aid picks up allowing the users to hear loud and clear unfortunately for the nearly 2 million telecoll hearing aid users and the up to an additional 10 million people with latent hearing impairments a very large percentage of whom

amendment really is quite simple it calls for the opportunity for the house to save 110 million by eliminating the appalachian regional commission over the years since the appalachian regional commission was begun in 1965 it has been a successful commission there is no question about that the question at this point is whether or not the work has been done and is it time to move on and get the appaliachian area in conjunction with the rest of the country the arc was funded at 105 million in fiscal year 1987 the fiscal year 1988 appropriations are now 110 million that is a 5 million increase in terms of fiscal policy and fundamental fairness i do not believe we can afford the special interest of the appalachianregional commission the appalach ian regional commission can apply to the economic development administration or the farmers home administration just like the other regions of the country have to do we are faced today with the opportunity under this amendment to really eliminate more programs with this one vote than we eliminated in the entire budget operation yesterday when we eliminated milk programs it has been said in this house on the floor yesterday in the debate on the budget that the president somehow is responsible for the huge budget deficits let us look at the facts one hundred forty billion dollars more than the presidents budgets that have been offered over the last 5 years has been added by this house so there is no question about where the deficit responsibility lies it lies with the unitedstates congress not with the white house here is our opportunity to do something about that we are faced with a budget that contains 19 5 billion in fiscal year 1988 alone for tax increases on the american people and it is 64 billion over thenext 3 years that is unacceptable it isunacceptable to the american people and it is certainly unacceptable to me and my constituents for the 20 years or so since president johnson signed the appalachian regional commission into law over 10 billion in federal state and local funding has been spent to improve the infrastructure and the quality of life of theappalachian region it has been a success there is no question about that i do not contest that but let me emphasize what i do contest what it says and this point was made in the legislation itself temporary program that is the term that was used as the region obtains the needed physical and transportation facilities and develops its human resources the congress expects that the region will generate a diversified industry and that the region will then be able to support itself through the workings of a strengthened free enterprise economy well i believe that they have done that i believe it is time now to sunset the legislation congress does not nor should it grant a federal government program immortality which seems to be the way we do around here on this side of the aisle we are criticized by saying that we have never seen a defense program we did not like well i think on the other side of the aisle we can say very clearly that they have never seen a program they could not spend money on and certainly never say one they wanted to terminate whether it was successful or unsuccessful i think that is really the issue the appalachian region still faces significant challenges no question but so does every other region of the country how about the farmers in the midwest how about in texas with the problems they are having today and not to mention other areas of the country that are solely dependent upon eda and the farmers home administration and not dependent on this special commission let us take a look at the commission itself fact by law the governors must hold two yearly meetings there are 13 two yearly meetings yet in 1984 they were unable to muster a necessary quorum of 7 so it cannot be that important to them according to the appalachian regional commission they have met only once a year for the last 3 years then came the talk from the president about eliminating the appalachian regional commission and then what happened well the best attendance in 6 years when we had 11 out of the 13 governors attend the last meeting so maybe the message is getting through we have gone far in addressing the needs which provided the impetus for the commission more than 2 000 miles of roads have been built more than 700 vocational schools have been built and more than 13 000 development grants have been made no question the question is should they continue to receive this unfair attention by the unitedstates treasury and by the taxpayers i think the answer to that is no for that reason i would urge adoption of this amendment and urge that my colleagues take this opportunity to eliminate

only propose to the american people a constitutional change which ultimately becomes constitutional law once in place of course we must live with it we must abide by it as members of congress but we cannot pass it out and that is the uniqueness of a constitutional law it is the peoples law they alone by threefourths of the states so ratifying can change the constitution of the united states we can only by a twothirds vote of this body and of the other body propose for ratification that change so in other words when we have a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget we here in the congress cannot change it overnight we cannot say that it is no longer appropriate we cannot live with it and we will waive the provision only the american people can make that decision and as we

looked at in depth i support these and other programs aimed at providing food assistance to needy individuals and families in fact these are but two of the several programs operated in the unitedstates department of agriculture to provide food assistance the usda programs alone account for over 20 billion in 1987 spending the committee bill does not increase expenditures in 1987 that was one of the goals of this legislation and i commend the subcommittee chairman for achieving that target however there are significant costs to the budget in 1988 and the outyears with insufficient offsets to accommodate these spending increases the committee was informed that the 1988 budget resolution will accommodate this additional spending at this point the 100th congress has not adopted the 1988 budget resolution and yet we are proposing to spend money we do not know if we will have for example the shelter deduction ceiling might be as low as 162 if the most recent weight given fuels and other utilities were used throughout the period under consideration included in the food assistance title are several changes to the food stamp program and reauthorization and improvement of the temporary emergency food assistance program this title first allows states to conduct outreach activities aimed at persons without permanent homes to encourage them to participate in the food stamp program the federal government will pay onehalf of all outreach costs second increases the shelter deduction for food stamp participants with high shelter costs from 149 per month to 168 per month

the temporary housing lacks facilities for preparation and cooking of hot meals or refrigeration fourth coordinates the annual adjustment of food stamp income levels with annual adjustments of food stamp benefit levels and deductions all will take place on october 1 fifth denies the earned income deduction to food stamp participants who deliberately fail to report earnings sixth allows the secretary upon certification of need by a state governor to provide up to 14 million pounds of surplus cheese for distribution within the state governors must certify that there are eligible participants not being served by tefap or that the unemployment rate within the state has risen and that the distribution of surplus cheese will not substantially displace the commercial sales of cheese seventh reauthorizes tefap through 1990 at the following levels 1988 52 million 1989 53 9 million 1990 56 2 million according to the congressional budget office there is no cost to the budget in 1987 as a result of the food assistance for the homeless provisions however in 1988 the cbo estimates the cost will be 111 millionthe total cost through 1990 is 387 million the cost of these provisions in 1988 and the outyears remains a concern to me as i stated during the subcommittee and committee consideration the congress has not yet adopted a 1988 budget resolution and i believe we must be budget conscious we must be assured that we can pay for future increases in the budget as we make these changes not only for aid to the homeless but for all expenditures of taxpayer dollars h r 558 of which the food assistance to the homeless title is just one part presents even greater budget problems cbo estimates the cost to be 500 million in 1987 with no offsets to pay for these additional expenditures at least in the agriculture committee we did exercise fiscal responsibility for 1987 and show no additional expenditures to the budget however for 1988 and the outyears we too have problems i am concerned about the homeless individuals and families however as we did in house joint resolution 102 we must be able to pay for the benefits we provide of the many issues before the 100th congress this is one which i find to be difficult to resolve as i have said before during the several hearings the subcommittee has held concerning this issue of food assistance to the needy i firmly believe that in our nation of abundance it is a tragedy for one child or one elderly person or anyone to go hungry we are a generous countryboth through government programs and through the private sector usda programs alone provide over 20 billion in food assistance private sector contributions to various nonprofit organizations regularly increase from year to year and approached 80 billion last year and yet there is no dispute that there are significant numbers of homeless people in both urban and rural areas of the united states the causes of homelessness are many and are complex they include the deinstitutionalization of mental health patients redevelopment of cities and the loss of lowrent housing highunemployment rates and a breakdown in traditional family structure the federal state and local programs available to low income individual and families often do not meet the needs of the homeless despite the bilions spent each year while housing is the key issue in dealing with homelessness other services are needed as well these include food assistance health and mental health clinics and for those who are able assistance in getting and keepng jobs the two major programs under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee that provide food assistance are the food stamp program and the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap neither of which are designed for the homeless but both provide assistance to this group of individuals through the food stamp program participants are provided food coupons which in most cases supplement the food budget of low income people however for the homeless difficulties arise in making full use of food coupons since they lack homes and cooking and food storage facilities last year the congress amended the food stamp act to allow the homeless to use food coupons in shelters and soup kitchens this provision was patterned after a proposal that i was working on along with chairman panetta concerning demonstration projects designed to allow the homeless to purchase low cost nutritious meals at soup kitchens while the amendment adopted last year does not address all concerns we covered in our proposal i am anxious to see how this further extension of the food stamp program to the homeless will work the pilot project we proposed presented a unique opportunity to begin solving a difficult problem in a straightforward manner lacking facilities for storage and preparation of food homeless individuals are unable to make optimal use of food stamp benefits to which they may be entitled by permitting such eligible individuals to use food stamps to purchase lowcost prepared meals the proposal would increase the effectiveness of the program for some of its most needy beneficiaries those operating the soup kitchens could have used food stamps for the purchase of food in large quantities thereby maximizing the efficiency of food stamp benefits for the homeless in addition the use of food stamps would have been limited to the purchase of food rather than preparation services and other associated costs also maximizing food stamp program funds by alleviating hunger and adhere to the goal of the food stamp act the second program under our committees jurisdiction is the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap provides surplus commodities to states for distribution to organizations serving lowincome people some of whom are homeless in 1988 it is anticipated that the commodities made available will include 420 million pounds of cheese 180 million pounds of rice 144 million pounds of flour 96 million pounds of honey 96 million pounds of nonfat dry milk 72 million pounds of butter and 48 million pounds of cornmeal with regard to tefap i am pleased that the congress acted to overturn the proposed deferral of 28 6 million of tefap administrative funds i introduced house joint resolution 124 which disapproved that deferral so that the full amount of money states had planned to use to distribute surplus foods will be available during this year the agriculture committee may be able to contribute to easing the problems of the homeless but solving this

defeat the bill has been impressive hundreds of calls have poured into my office and i assume to many others as well interest groups which support the bill have been active as national organizations but they have not developed a grassroots campaign of their own the number of calls into my own offices and the concern of my constituents have forced me to scrutinize the bill even more closely i have tried to determine whether the legislation would result in the changes feared ii 1067 by its opponents but i have found no such language in this bill many citizens fear that federal courts will misinterpret the law one should always be nervous about people in black robes but if we let nervousness turn into paranoia we could never pass another bill this legislation does not change our current civil rights laws other than to restore the application of those laws to cover an entire institution rather than a program of an institution if federal funds are received this was the way civil rights laws were administered prior to the supreme courts grove city decision over 4 years ago none of the fears being expressed now were realized before grove city churchrelated schools were not forced to hire homosexuals and farmers and small grocers were not covered and abortions were not forced upon churchrun teaching hospitals the bill has been designed to narrow the coverage of the civil rights laws to ensure that the laws would work as they did before the court decision the congress has been debating this issue for 4 years it has not proceeded this far without plenty of discussion and debate we all knew this legislation was coming and there have been some opportunities for imputs of course i prefer the regular order in the house i would be happier if the house had moved the bill under its regular procedures i cannot defend the procedures under which it passed the house but in a matter of this importance i cannot let procedure stand as a more compelling argument than substance the need to overrule the grove city decision is too great first of all many of the interests expressing opposition to the legislation would not even be covered by it it is well to remember that an organization is covered only if it receives federal funds there is language in the bill which excludes such ultimate beneficiaries as farmers welfare social security medicare and food stamp recipients from coverage under the bill there is a religious tenet provision which would enable churchcontrolled organizations to refuse to perform abortions or to refuse to hire homosexual teachers the intent here is to interpret this language as broadly as possible as a result many of the major religious organizations have supported s 557 to date no religious group applying for a religious tenet exemption has been denied an exemption to be sure i would prefer the language affiliated with to the language of the bill controlled by in the religious tenets section but the history of the current law is that the religious tenet language has been interpreted well there is a restatement of current law that companies or organizations receiving federal funds would not have to hire a person with a contagious disease such as aids alcoholism or drug addition if there would be a direct threat to the health or safety to others rthere is in addition a small provider provision which exempts small businesses from expensive alternations of their businesses for excess by the handicapped if they can provide services to the handicapped in some other way homosexuals are not covered under any of these laws now and there is nothing in this bill that extends any rights to them there have been attempts for many years to amend civil rights laws to include sexual preference but congress has shown no interest at all but for more important than any defense against attacks on this bill is the need to make our rights laws work to accent the positive the urgent need to guarantee the rights of american citizens far outweighs the objections to s 557 and where are civil rights more important than in our institutions of higher education young americans preparing themselves for leadership roles in our society should above all be working in a discriminationfree environment for me thats what this bill is all about and thats why i support s 557 civil rights laws should be administered to end discrimination due to race gender age or disability in the manner intended by the congress before the grove city decision i do not believe that this bill goes beyond that and therefore i shall vote to override the

congresses it is proof that despite the difficult economic challenges we have faced in international trade over the past few years the underlying basis of a dynamic economy is free trade two of the largest most diverse and economically progressive countries in the world have taken another step forward by opening their borders to each other and by achieving disciplines in a wide range of new traderelated arenas the unitedstates trade representative has provided us an impressive array of statistics that demonstrate why this agreement is so important in 1987 for example total bilateral trade in goods and services between the united states and canada exceeded 166 billion making these two countries the largest trading partners in the world the united states exports over twice as much in merchandise to canada a land of 26 million people than it does to japan with its population of 120 million the united states sells 24 percent of its total merchandise exports to canada canada supplies 17 percent of goods imported by the united states the united states purchases 76 percent of canadas exported goods and the united states supplies 68 percent of canadian imports united statescanada trade in energy was 9 billion in 1987 including crude oil petroleum products natural gas electricity coal and uranium total bilateral fore gn direct investment exceeds 68 billion over 1 400 united states business affiliates of canadian companies employ over 527 000 workers in the united states these statistics demonstrate the vast potential for economic expansion and growth under this historic agreement in addition to the expected gains from the elimination of all tariffs over a 10year period provisions of the agreement in nontariff areas such as energy government procurement services investments and intellectual property rights will provide the bedrock for longterm mutual benefits expanded twoway trade and investment can create millions of new jobs increase opportunities for both canadians and americans and greatly enhance the prosperity of both nations we can look at the example of other existing free trade areas to get an indication of the potential benefits of this agreement covering much larger economies the creation of the european economic community affords the most appropriate example from 1959 to 1969 the period when all ec tariffs were eliminated trade within the ec rose 347 percent about three times higher than outside the ec after great britain entered the ec in 1973 its exports to other member states grew by 28 percent per year for a 10year period imports from ec partners rose by 24 percent both spain and portugal have shown even greater trade expansion since their recent entry into the ec also twoway trade between australia and new zealand has nearly doubled since 1983 when they reached an accord liberalizing trade between them former secretary of the treasury james baker who was instrumental in finalizing the negotiations between our two countries has called the agreement truly a winwin enterprise by opening markets and establishing rules of fair play across a wide range of economic activity we can achieve better prices for consumers and businesses and create major commercial and investment opportunities he went on to say that the agreement reaffirms that the united states and canada are not only geographic neighbors but most special economic neighbors as well the successful conclusion of this agreement with its wideranging provisions supports his words in addition to the reduction of tariffs already mentioned the united statescanada agreement provides numerous improvements in the nontariff area for example the agreement establishes detailed rules of origin designed to properly identify those products of canadian and united states manufacture although necessary to ensure that the benefits of the pact are not extended to noncontributing countries the new definitions of origin signal a more effective method of determining such rules amorg all trading partners similarly the new disputesettlement procedures worked out between canada and the united states hopefully will result in more effective and more timely resolutions to trade disputes that can be translated to the multilateral process it remains for the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations now underway in geneva to take full advantage of the example the united states and canada have set in this and many other areas although the gatt is still arguing over what can be properly addressed by that international body this bilateral agreement has boldly addressed sectors of growing trade importance such as services traderelated investment and intellectual property rights furthermore the agreement provides secure fair access to canadian energy supplies even in times of shortage removes virtually all existing discrimination by canada against united states financial institutions as well as significantly liberalizing canadas foreign investment regime improves the rules under which bilateral auto trade is conducted limits agriculture and other subsidies removes meat import quotas improves mutual procedures for setting technical standards and enhances the applications when speaking before the canadian parliament last year president reagan referred to the open border between our two countries

hemisphere in the event of a conventional war in europe or in the persian gulf cuba would constitute a threat to our ability to aid our allies and defend our strategic interests in those vital regions the secretary also said we risked nuclear confrontation with the soviet union over the removal of their missiles from cuba today we must spend billions of dollars to strengthen our counterintelligence apparatus and our naval and air defenses against soviet use of an island 90 miles off our shore and we learned the value of such an outpost to the soviet union which spends and i think this is

of weapon system that might be deployed in a rail garrison basing mode what is wrong with the rail garrison concept the answer is nothing as i have said in general debate we have tried for a long time to come up with a successful survivable basing mode for unitedstates icbms we considered the multiple protective system to hide a number of icbms in a large number of holes in the ground mps failed for political reasons we considered the racetrack basing mode racetrack also failed the list goes on and on we have presently put our mx missiles in minuteman iii silos which are fixed identified targets for political reasons this is the best that we could come up with we continuously hear that opponents of mx oppose it because it is vulnerable in a fixed silo so why not harden it the fact is you cannot adequately harden missile silos because improvements in missile accuracy will overcome silo hardness every time you cannot adequately harden a silo against a direct hit or a near hit of a nuclear weapon just as we have increased our missile accuracy so too have the soviets so we know we must have a more survivable system to reiterate the defense department has been attempting to develop such a survivable system they came up with an idea of housing it in and launching it from an airplane this idea fell by the wayside they came up with the idea of burying missiles thousands of feet under ground so that when the shooting was over it could dig itself out and be launched we have considered numerous schemes some good some bad at present the administration has come up with a basing mode similar to that the soviets are using on their ss24s the soviets have built and are in the process of deploying a rail mobile ss24 missile system they do not worry about public opinion in the soviet union so their mobile systems are not even stationed in garrisons but as the soviets realize and our own intelligence experts tell us there is no way you can target all rail mobile systems you cannot be sure where they all are all the time this is what we are proposing to do with rail garrison except we will station them in garrisons until such time as there is a threat rail garrisoned missiles will not be roaming the rail network during peacetime rail garrison is similar to how we dis perse our aircraft in times of an alert and similar to how we plan to disperse our small mobile missile when deployed in the event of a soviet nuclear attack we will have some warning time and it does not make any difference if we can only disperse them 5 miles 50 miles or 500 miles you have built in an uncertainty factor and a survivability factor so that a potential enemy could never be sure that a first strike will be successful this is what congress asked and the scowcroft commission recommended the defense department to dobuild a more survivable system the money is in here because the members of the committee thought it the responsible thing to do we are going forward to develop the concept although the mx will fit on it the small mobile will also fit on it as will any followon missile but we are only developing a concept and the committee has approved 250 million for this which incidentally is a reduction of about 250 million from what the administration requested we would like to develop the concept in no way is rail garrison a threat to the small mobile missile in fact the small mobile missile could ultimately be deployed on this rail concept please do not deny the department of defense the capability of developing this concept this is a research and development program to develop the rail garrison concept so that in time of crisis or even war we could disperse a percentage of our icbms as we would disperse the small mobile missile our bombers and the other strategic systems rail garrison makes sense it is what we have been working toward it is less expensive than the alternatives that have been proposed and certainly much cheaper than the basing and operational plan for midgetman it is about 15 billion compared to 45 billion according to the air force the small mobile missile will call for 10 400 additional personnel than we presently have just to man and protect the system so the congress and the administration agreed that we would take a dual track in modernizing our icbm force i hope we keep the rail garrison money in the

established 1 percent of gross national product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national

technology which occurred twice with particular disdain i am pleased to see the substantive steps taken by the japanese to get to the heart of the toshiba problem and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a copy of a recent article by richard perle president reagans former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy regarding the toshiba machine incident h j res 327 joint resolution requiring the president or his designee to enter into negotiations with japan for the purpose of having japan bear a greater share of the free worlds defense burden by

japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well

of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963

abroad six years of cajoling pleading bargaining and negotiating will be made to appear a capricious ephemeral impulse rather than the serious policy initiative the president intended what congress simply doesnt understand is that no president can defend our interests in this or any other matter if his policies can be snapped around like a rubber band the march so evident in congress and in such executive agencies as the department of commerce to weaken export controls is lumbering forward behind the banner of competitiveness this years slogan masquerading as a policy the fellows who want to keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic red tapea complaint that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige whose department dispenses red tape by the mile echoes happily at industry lunches and in congressional testimony now if mac would put the time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the western alliance the president who has taken the lead in arguing for effective export controls will appear pale and depleted if he falls to take charge of the kongsbergtoshlba affair and abandoning policies aimed at protecting our technology will diminish both consistency and credibilityand our security as well ronald reagans signature on a bill that vitiates the effectiveness of export controls

i just wanted to follow up i was very proud when i went to philadelphia over this weekend i was very proud of the fact that the gentlewoman from louisiana who just spoke was the president of our session in philadelphia i was particularly pleased as a woman to know that she in 1987 was the president of that session i recognize that the 55 members who were there in philadelphia had no blacks had no orientals had no women but what is so special about this document is that through the amendment process it is a living changing fluid document i know that as a woman my female ancestors did not get the right to vote until the 19th amendment in 1920 i know that my black colleagues brothers and sistersbrothers got the right to vote earlier than that but it was long in coming it was hardfought but it is through this document that the changes are able to be made i know i for one would like to see another amendment i would like to see the equal rights amendment added to our constitution but all of that makes very special this particular year the 100th congress in the 200th anniversary of our constitution now mention was made earlier by my colleague the gentleman from oregon that last year a measure of this nature came up and it was defeated it was defeated that was the 99th congress we now have the 100th congress we now have had a number of ceremonies where we realize the true significance of the constitution this year i believe also as legislators we have open minds we listen we learn we recognize we cherish and we act accordingly we are never so rigidly structured into something that happened 1 2 3 years ago things are constantly changing i also have heard a figure used a figure that i think is absolutely preposterous with regard to the cost of this particular onetime only measure the figure that i have is our own budget office the congressional budget office which indicates that there would be a 300 million cost we have a letter from them indicating that that is what they project it may not be 100 percent accurate but dealing with guesstimates it is probably the best guesstimate they could come up with the figure my colleague heard included the postal workers who are exempt from this bill since they are not the fedcral government as such the figure my colleague heard was one of what it cost the federal government to operate each day plus special pay what it costs them to operate per day is going to go on whether they are there or not the work that they might accomplish on that day with the boost in morale could well be accomplished in 2 days prior to that or several days prior to that because this is the special event someone also mentioned that congress will not be in session because of this legal holiday i submit congress will not be in session whether we pass this bill or not i submit on that day the president will be going to philadelphia there will not be a session of congress so what are we doing is exempting ourselves and forgetting we the people the people who are out there who keep government in operation i also reiterate the fact that this country is so special and the reason our ancestors came here was because of the hopes the opportunities and the dreams that were offered by the we the people concept and all that it represents in that constitution i am the daughter of immigrant parents they came here because they knew that this country would offer them opportunities through education through the opportunities i am able to be here in this chamber i serve with my colleagues with members who were not even born in the united states but have had the great opportunity that comes from this country to serve in the unitedstates congress we talk about commemoration it has been my enormous honor to be able to have the time allocation on this side for the commemorations and i deem that an honor and i appreciate the commemorations that we handle but i do not put the bicentennial of the constitution in the same category as national asparagus day that is the very kind of thing that is being suggested by virtue of the amendment that is going to be offered so i say to my colleagues december 26 last year was declared a legal holiday by the president of the united states and i do not know what that day commemorates july 3 of this year was declared a legal holiday by the president of the united states and i do not know what july 3 reflects or represents remember every year july 4 is a special holiday and i do know what that represents but that was the beginning and what the fruition was was a

matter here last thursday when i explained in the presentation of the rule why we deferred allowing drug amendments to be inserted in this bill except we did allow the distinguished chairman of the armed services committee to offer an amendment increasing the amount of money available to the department of defense to carry on the war against drugs that amendment is in the rule and as i understand it the distinguished chairman of the committee expects to exercise the authority in the rule granted him in that respect second the gentlemen have apparently enjoyed charging the rules committee with violating its own rules they are erroneously assuming that the rules committee promulgated a firm rule that we would entertain no amendment filed after a certain time that is not correct we simply in a dear colleague letter said it was the expectation of the rules committee that we would not allow amendments that were offered to the rules committee after a certain date but after we began to consider the rule and the date had passed we found a large number of amendments that had been offered subsequent to the date we specified in the dear colleague letter we considered those amendments considered them meritorious and allowed about 20 amendments after the filing date that we said was the date of expectation with respect to our allowing additional amendments about half of those amendments were sponsored by members of the minority and about half by the members of the majority so we felt that that was the right decision to make we allowed 20 amendments in addition to those that we previously offered that came into us after the date that we specified in the dear colleague letter where we set out our expectations now the third thing the gentlemen have said we were presumptuous in saying there was a danger there was an intent on the part of the defense department to transfer these six cutters now let me call your attention to the letter that the distinguished chairman of the committee on armed services read to the house just a few minutes ago hon les aspin chairman committee on armed services house of representatives washington dc dfar lis one of the keystones of the continuing success of the unitedstates policy in the persian gulf has been the cooperative attitude between the executive and legislative branches in the formulation of that policy in that spirit i discussed over the last two weeks with you and other congressional leaders planned policy changes in those discussions and elsewhere significant questions were raised about the need for coast guard forces in the persian gulf and about the potential harm to other coast guard missions from a diversion of ships to the gulf in light of these questions and concerns i have decided not to request a deployment of coast guard ships to the persian gulf at this time over the next several months we will further review our force structure in the area in the event that it is determined at some time in the future that coast guard forces are necessary to our policy and goals in the persian gulf i can assure you that i will again consult with congress before a decision is made now there must have been some justification for the distinguished chairman of the coast guard subcommittee for calling a meeting of his colleagues to discuss the matter he certainly had some indication from these discussions that it was planned on the part of the defense department to change their policy and send those coast guard cutters over there i dare say that the reaction of the members of the house to that proposed change in policy led to the decision of the department of defense not to make that transfer so we were acting apparently upon a suspicion that appeared to be wellfounded now then in view of the fact that the defense department has very graciously in a spirit of cooperation with our congress announced that they will not carry out that change in policy they might do it at some time in the future but if they do congress will be notified in ample time for congress to take such action as it chooses to take with respect to this critical matter so i think all of us have acted with propriety and in the national interest i hope i have explained to the distinguished gentleman from california some of the matters about which i regret to say he has some confusion in his mind now that is all i have to say i am prepared now when the others have made comments that they wish to makeand i think i have the remainder of the timei am prepared to submit a unanimous consent

favor the use of sales proceeds to establish trust funds for the benefit of indian education child welfare community development i want no one to misunderstand me i support such objectives but i am faced with a serious dilemma h r 4519 involves property disposal procedures that fly in the face of the long established policies and procedures which the federal property and administrative services act establishes for the utilization and disposal of federal property i chair the government operations subcommittee of government activities and transportation which has jurisdiction over that act clearly the 110 acres of indian school land in phoenix will be no longer required for the needs of the department of the interior and the discharge of its program responsibilities according to the federal property act this land would be regarded as excess then if there is no further federal need the land would be determined surplus and ready for nonfederal disposal but except for an 11 5acre parcel assignable to the va further federal agency needs would be ignored the bill of course operates without regard to the federal property act but that act would require maximum utilization of excess property by executive agencies we do not know what needs another federal agency might have for part of this land in order to serve an authorized program in this respect h r 4519 is a complete departure from standard federal property management policy and practice ftthormore h r 4519 sanctions a negotiated disposal to a private person of what in reality will be surplus property that is surplus to all federal agencies needs the federal property act does not permit negotiated disposal by any mode to an entity other than a public agency unless it is impractical to advertise publicly for competitive bids and the estimated fair market value can be obtained by negotiation h r 4519 specifically recognizes that the phoenix school land can and may be offered for competitive bids further we must deal with the practical fact that the limited public offering under h r 4519 supposed to establish the market value is not a truly open and valid competitive procedure the bill would give the collier family the right to obtainthe phoenix land anyway simply by matching the highest july 11 7 1988 bid it is hard to conceive of a potential outside bidder that would be strongly interested for he would have to spend the resources necessary to plan for evaluate prepare and submit an allcash bid undoubtedly with a large bid deposit and made irrevocable for 4 months knowing that whatever he might bid collier working from important advantages financial and otherwise could come in and snatch the property away every congress the government activities and transportation subcommittee reviews and comments in detail on upward of 50 proposed negotiated disposals of surplus real property these come to us in the form of explanatory statements submitted to the committee by the administrator of general services this duty is imposed on the committee by the federal property act our committee has exercised this responsibility over several decades it has gained much experience with surplus land disposals i can flatly state that the disposal procedures this bill adopts do not adequately protect the public interest moreover they amount to a potentially huge federal subsidy to a private developer at the federal taxpayers expense it is an all too common fallacy to believe that when the government spends valuable and highly marketable surplus real estate it is not spending tax dollars fair value given for fair value received is the standard that should apply to all spending therefore i must vote against the bill as now framed and urge its rejection"],

chairman of our subcommittee mr gonzalez deserves special praise for his leadership on the conference report before us today along with our chairman i would like to single out other important members and my colleagues on the banking committee mrs roukema the ranking republican on the subcommittee and mr vento they have all provided strong leadership contributions in designing and improving the basic homeless assistance programs enacted in the first session of the 100th congress for todays conference report the banking committees portion of the conference report provides only modest increased funding in fiscal year 1989 and 1990 for the three existing programs for the homeless fema emergency food and shelter program emergency shelter grant program and the transitional housing demonstration program as well as additional funding for the section 8 moderate rehabilitation for single room occupancy program a total of 410 1 million is authorized for fiscal year 1989 and 426 2 million for fiscal year 1990 for these homeless assistance programs under the banking committees jurisdiction the conference report contains several policy changes which are designed to improve the efficiency in delivering much needed homeless aid to state local and private nonprofit organizations such as encouragement for more technical assistance and improved coordination of information by state agencies greater flexibility has been provided by increasing from 15 percent to 20 percent the amounts of funds under the emergency shelter grant which may be used to provide essential services despite these positive changes still greater flexibility and local determination in my judgment is needed before the homeless assistance programs will truly reach their most effective potential homelessness is a diverse and essentially localized problem and the solutions therefore must be designed to provide such local discretion we would have preferred to see the acceptance of the ridge roukema block grant approach which was narrowly defeated by the house on august 3 which would have created maximum local flexibility for local communities in administering the mckinney act programs through a block grant system notwithstanding these reservations i believe that the conference report under consideration is on the right track and should receive our support this conference report also makes some modifications not directly related to homelessness which were necessary to provide technical and other clarifications to the housing and community development act of 1987 while these provisions at first appeared to be controversial with the administration i am now satisfied that the budgetary concerns expressed relating to changes in the section 8 program used in conjunction with huds loan management program have been significantly improved and their cost impact moderated sufficient to at least soften some of the administrations opposition this legislation is strongly supported by the united way the salvation army the national council of jewish federations the american red cross the national conference of catholic charities the national council of churches and by such organizations as the national mental health association the association for retarded citizens united cerebral palsy and the easter seal society these organizations represent only a few of the people who are in the front lines in our battle to end homelessness and i believe that they will make excellent use of the funds provided in the mcklnney act while title v of this act is not under the jurisdiction of the banking committee how section 501 is interpreted is a matter of great importance to our committee whether or not title v is interpreted as including single family properties in the fhas inventory has major implications for the solvency of the fha insurance funds section 501 of the mckinney act requires federal agencies to survey their buildings and real property to determine which are underutllized and might be available for the temporary shelter of the homeless nothing in section 501 or its legislative history in any way indicates that it was intended to apply to fha single family properties as i understand it the conference agreement contains language intended to ensure more rapid and effective use of unutilized and underutilized federal buildings however the conference agreement does not expand the universe of covered properties to include those in the fhas inventory of single family homes for this i commend the conferees as a recent unitedstates district court case has already shown an erroneous interpretation of title v can result in a freeze in fhas 3 billion annual sales program would place the insurance fund in jeopardy or force its dependence on appropriations while we must do all we can directly to assist the homeless we must be careful not to change unintentionally the basic nature of the fhas vital insurance programs which have provided
