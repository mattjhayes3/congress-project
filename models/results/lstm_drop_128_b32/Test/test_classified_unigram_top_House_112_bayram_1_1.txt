justify continuing to pour american lives and resources into the bottomless pit of afghanistan and he closed this column with these words we wanted to kill or capture osama bin laden and we did even so say the hawks we have to stay in afghanistan because of the dangerous instability across the border in nucleararmed pakistan but does anyone believe the war in afghanistan has made pakistan more stable these are not my words again these are the words of eugene robinson whos nationally known and respected and he is a liberal hes not a conservative but the point hes making is exactly right how many more young men and women have to give their life for a corrupt leader i would like to ask my colleagues on both sides to join jim mcgovern of massachusettsi am a cosponsor of this bill its h r 1735 the afghan exit and accountability act it gives a parameter to the president as to how we need to start bringing our troops out of afghanistan before 2014 or 2015 i look at this young mans face his name is tyler jordan his father was killed in iraq i look at him and he represents all the children in america who are crying because their moms and dads are coming back dead many are coming back without arms and legs so tyler represents children in america who have their family loved ones over in afghanistan its time to bring them home and then the other poster has the flagdraped coffinthey call it a transfer casecoming into dover air force base how many more families in this country have to look at the flagdraped coffin of their loved one thats why i hope both sides will join mr mcgovern and myself in h r 1735 because mr gates has already said we will be in afghanistan until 2014 and 2015 thats what eugene robinson is saying how many more have to die in the next 3 or 4 years

eliminating discrimination against preexisting conditions or the other discriminatory practices like lifetime or annual caps or the requirement that young people up to the age of 26 be able to get insurance coverage on their parents policies all of these things essentially depend on the mandate because without the mandate what happens is that insurance companies go back again to discriminatory practices this is nothing more but an effort essentially to eliminate the health care reform whether its defunded whether its eliminating the mandate or the other amendments that were going to see

amendment which says in america law enforcement will respect the individual dignity of each person and operate on the basis of what would indicate criminal behavior not race not national origin not religion the leaders of four separate important caucuses in this congress have come together and are in support that includes the congressional progressive caucus the congressional black caucus the congressional hispanic caucus and the congressional asian pacific american caucus which have all come together to say this is an important thing for all of us to support everyone here in this body

when they put their lives at risk for our safety no one questions law enforcement in general but you should know and there is no doubt and there is ample evidence to demonstrate that there have been occasions in which individual americans have been singled out and this is not what our nation is about its not the policy that we should support and therefore we should support an amendment which says that discrimination has no place in the administration of the law occasionally reports of racial ethnic and religious profiling do surface we see them in the media and reports in the civil liberty unions in fact i have reports in my hand immigration enforcement minor offenses with major consequences by the aclu and the growing human rights crisis which details how people have been singled out based on impermissible criteria and so it is important for us to affirm in america after all we have gone through to create liberty and justice for all that weve got to affirm this principle here today too many americans who were simply going about their business have been discriminated against based solely on race ethnicity and religion its wrong when it happens all of us can agree and its not what our country is all about this amendment im offering today simply says its contrary to our values our amendment is straightforward it simply cites the constitution and existing antidiscrimination laws to affirm that no funds made available by this bill can be used to engage in racial ethnic or religious profiling this is not a controversial amendment it affirms core american values hard fought for not only in the civil rights movement but many others even including the civil war nor it is partisan in fact it was a former bush administration official who said religious or

medicare reimbursements are already so low you reduce them even further you are going to start to see doctors and hospitals stop providing those services to our seniors and so in the end this ipab
