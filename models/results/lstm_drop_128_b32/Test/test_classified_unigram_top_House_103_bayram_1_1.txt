kind of historical perspective because i was the one who carried the resolution on the floor a year ago basically today suggesting that the house did have an obligation to come forward with all the material related to the investigation as was mentioned when the investigation was finished at the house post office last year it became clear that what we were getting was a sanitized version of that investigation that certain information that was available to the committee was not made available to the house so therefore at that time we asked that the whole of the information be presented the reason now becomes clear for presenting us with all the information with the recent conviction of a former officer of the house we now understand that there was a widespread problem in the house post office it may involve as the recent documentation indicates several members of congress what we do know is that this is something that has gone on for 20 years again according to the house postmaster who is now convicted it is something of which there was an investigation some 15 years ago in which people perjured themselves in order not to have that investigation go forward we now know that in the house investigation that did take place last year that perjury took place in the course of that investigation as well there has been a longterm effort to cover up house post office problems now we have the obligation it seems to me to move beyond the coverup we now know that there is institutional corruption in the house what wecannot permit to go on is the coverup now there are going to be all kinds of gimmicks used to try to continue the coverup and we are goingto end up with a wide variety of explanations as to why the house cannot release to the public that which the house already has in its possession we do have now the understanding thatwhen the house voted 1 year ago this month not to move ahead with disclosure they were in fact voting for coverup at that point now 223 members on july 23 voted to cover up this matter last year and we now know why they knew at that point that they had a serious problem they knew that this serious problem goes to the very heart of the institution because it goes to the question of officers of the house who they voted for and it goes to many of the questions that have always been on the back burner with regard to the house post office of who knew what when did they know it and why was there an effort to keep the capitol police from investigating thoroughly to keep the investigation contained within the house administration committee not to have any kind of public testimony remember when republicans first asked for this investigation to take place we wanted to have public testimony we wanted to run this just like other investigations that are held on the hill where people were called in were sworn in public testimony and where there were actual hearings held that we were denied all of it went behind closed doors and

collins was truly an unusual individual he would be classified as an example of a living legend he would not have appreciated hearing that probably but i have never met anybody like him and i think most people felt that way b t actually i first met when he was as has been mentioned was governor browns chief of staff and he was a republican even then actually b t opposed me as i recall my first three elections but he did not know me all that well and he eventually came around and supported me very staunchly particularly beginning with the 1990 election when there was a very controversial tough issue that came up and he jumped right to my defense i am not here tonight because he either opposed or supported me simply to observe that b t collins was a straighttalking man if he told you something you could count on it and he was one of the few individuals i have ever known that actually whatever he said he would do he always did that and then some i think that was respected very much about him i had the privilege of attending just a wonderful service that was quite a lengthy one but actually every speaker there had something valuable to say it went on for abut 2 hours it was the memorial service right near the vietnam veterans memorial that he actually brought into being through his perseverance an outstanding memorial thatwould be if we had nothing here in washington i think would make it seem to pale by comparison i am always proud of it when i see it and i realize it was through his efforts obviously these things are a team effort but b t took the lead and went to many people and i say this personally and solicited contributions and really made it happen it was so unusual to me it is one thing to lend your name to an effort but b t went well beyond that he actually personally took charge and went down the list and called people and buttonholed them and collected those contributions many times i would see him around the district not just the sacramento area there too but he never represented for example nevada county and yet i would see him when they had the annual republican barbecue b t collins had driven up to the fairgrounds in grass valley to give a talk and share his thoughts with the people they loved him and as i would watch him climb into his car i thought how difficult well that is difficult frequently going beyond your area to speak taking time away from other priorities but i thought here was b t collins severely injured in the war and frankly i think never without pain not that he ever showed any sign of that but i am given to understand through the remarks that were made that he was almost in constant paizi and yet he never revealed never complained about it always giving and realizing that i think about him climbing into his car and tired at the end of a sunday afternoon where he had given a speech in nevada county quite distant from where his focus of activities would have been when i think of b t collins i think of the following terms heart b t collins was a man with heart he understood people he loved people and he did everything he could to try and improve peoples circumstances loyalty fiercely loyal to whomever his superior officer was i mean i saw that loyalty clearly first for governor brown and then to tom hayes the state treasurer and then to governor wilson b t collins sat in my office it was wednesday i guess and told me he had no interest in running for the state assembly and the following tuesday he declared he declared because the man to whom he was loyal whom he served the governor of california asked him to run and for b t collins anybody knows running a political campaign is a major undertaking he gave up a job that paid him pretty well and instead went into the political fray once again and he did it out of a sense of loyalty made a lot of sacrifice service b t collins believed in public service he was i think the premier exemplar of that the gentleman from california referenced his accomplishments in taking the ccc and really giving it form and definition and inspiring young people to want to serve in that body he really personifled the california conservation corps always felt proud i think of that assoclation i have mentioned before b t collins was a man of action he was a good talker never forget his talk but he was a man of action and as the gentleman listed in his accomplishments he was out there always doing things in lieu of flowers we have been invited to send contributions to the weve center woman escaping a violent environment so even there in death he was out there active raising funds for the causes that he believed in i just want to mention briefly i saw him various times at the eagle scout courts of honor and it was always interesting to listen to him speak i do not think i ever saw him speak with notes he always just spoke straight to the audience came right from the heart and it was always interesting and frequently memorable the things that he had to say reference has been made to the notes and he also called people on their birthdays in fact i was surprised i got a telephone call it is just so unusual that people are able to make the time to do hat kind of thing and as irony would have it i had gone through a file which i was overdue in looking at of correspondence sent to me and i pulled out two notes from b t collins to me and i took them home to show julie but as fate would have it he passed away before i had that opportunity to do that and so when i came back from the funeral last week i pulled those notes out and showed her along with the program of his memorial service and b t collins attending the memorial service by the way it was really kind of the outpouring of support you would find almost for a deceased president i commented upon that i have never seen during my time at the scene there in the state capital an outtouring of support like we had for b t collins it was truly remarkable he was an outstanding individual i think he always will have left an impression upon my mind of someone who truly through his actions performed the acts of christian service i am very very pleased to be here this evening to join in this special order commending b t collins i think his relatives and friends can be very proud of him and the life that he led and i for one shall have

and that was the danger of going hollow report that admiral kelso spearheaded 6 or 7 months ago we have seen a drop in ammunition reserve levels we have seen a drop in training time we have seen a drop in repair levels of our military equipment and we have seen also a drop in a very impor tant category and that is the number of aircraft and other military equipment with respect to being fully mission capable if you remember back to the days of the 1970s we had about 50 percent of our military aircraft that were fully mission capable the rest of the aircraft were being taken apart for spare parts so that the few aircraft that we thought we could keep running had adequate spares to stay in the air so after rebuilding defense in the 1980s bringing down the berlin wall with that strong america and emerging once again the only superpower in the world we are seeing our military readiness being reduced and i have to go back to a point that the ranking member the gentleman from south carolina brought out that i think is very important the dod task force on readiness has acknowledged recently that unitedstates forces are running too hard what does running too hard mean it means you cannot take president clintons cuts in defense of 127 billion and continue to go to all of these trouble spots in africa and haiti and bosnia and korea and around the world and stretch these forces without the equipment or the reserves that is the personnel to free these people up so they can spend a little time at home after they come off a 6month deployment we are not doing that we are stretching our people too thin what does that mean that means we may go back to the hollow forces of the 1970s when we had 1 000 petty officers a month getting out of the military those are the people

a national discussion that we need to have about health care there is much that is good with our present health care system there are some real problems that need to be solved and you all have just touched upon this that is the idea that if a person changes jobs then they lose their health care then when they sign up for a new job then they have to qualify if they have developed what they call a preexisting condition at their previous job now they have lost that insurance and they go to the new one and in many cases they may not even be able to get insurance i think oneof the goals as we seek to reform our health care system since employees really have to earn their health insurance because after all that is one of their benefits it is just not given as a gift but it is tied to their working showing up for work since they earn that they ought to be able to own it it ought to be personal to them and portable it has been suggested by experts looking into this field that if businesses are not willing to provide that kind of a personal and portable plan then they ought not to get the tax deduction for providing that type of health insurance the gentleman from illinois and

one to fix on but let us say 37 million 60 percent of that 37 million are under the age of 30 they are the healthiest sector really of the job market and the primary reason these individuals do not have health insurance is because the price is too high why is the price too high the price is too high because in many cases of the governments own involvement with its own regulations which drive the price up the irony is that one of the solutions that we hear being advanced to the health care crisis is a law passed that says employers must provide health insurance for their employees a mandate imposed by the government we have heard within the last month figures as high as 12 percent can you imagine that a new payroll tax 12 percent laid on the employer plus about 3 percent for the employee

allowing a vote today on the roemerzlmmer amendment to kill the space station allowing it 5 days after a similar amendment to the nasa authorization bill was considered and failed by one vote the question is why should the committee on rules less than a week after we voted on this issue make it in order to vote on it again i think the answer is an important one and one that i hope some of my colleagues who voted against the roemer zimmer amendment on wednesday will consider carefully the fact is that a vote for a program in the context of an authorization bill is essentially a free vote because it is not competing against any other program as senator hatfield was quoted as saying in todays washington post legislative authorization is a hunting license because it allows a department or agency to look for funding actually to carry out the authorized programs in contrast when you look at the space station in the context of an appropriations bill as we will today you are talking about a zero sum game because every dollar spent on the space station is a dollar less spent on something else it is either a dollar less spent on deficit reduction a dollar less spent on veterans programs a dollar less spent on housing programs or as my colleague from florida has pointed out a dollar less spent on nasa itself the fact is that in ramping up space station expenditures in the appropriations bill in order to meet the request of the clinton administration the space shuttleprogram had to take a considerable reduction in its funding in the appropriations committee similarly there was a 40 million cut made in the hope program the home ownership program initiated by jack kemp in the last administration in order to free up money for the space station so this is a vote in the context of the real world a vote in the context of competing needs and competing demands for our budget dollars and in the context of an overall commitment that many of us have made for deficit reduction that is why many members who voted last year against killing the space station when the proposal was an amendment to an authorization bill shortly afterwards voted in favor of a similar amendment in the context of an appropriations bill that is why this year i anticipate that many members who voted against the roemerzimmer amendment to the authorization bill will vote in favor of the

blessed with some of the finest natural resources in the world second it will say we took those resources and combined them with the besttraned workforce in the world to produce the words best

in with such low bids the australian government wondered why last year the australians looked int9 the shipping industry i think the name of the report says it all ifs called ships of shame they found that the reason many foreign ships can bid low is because they ignore workers rigts and safe working conditions australia found that in the past 4 years ships were so badly maintained that 44 ships and 342 lives have been lost at sea they found case after case where seafarers were abused and exploited by officers they found that many ships keep two pay books one for official records and one for lower actual pay no wonder many of these lowwage foreignflag ships are registered under what are known as shipsofconvenlnce because these shipowners arent complying with inconvenient health safety labor and environmental standards our maritime industry is more expensive is because they are the safest besttrained commercial fleet in the world thats the price you pay for quality shouldnt we be on

humanity and food banks eligible for federal surplus property under current law these organizations are not eligible i want to thank chairman conyers and the members of the house committee on government operations for reporting this bill to the house floor i greatly appreciate their cooperation and support in moving this bill forward the federal property and administrative services act authorizes gsa to dispose of surplus federal property surplus property is property not needed by any federal agency it may be made available by gsa to state or local governments or nonprofit agencies and may be transferred without cost for specified public purposes including education recreation economic development health care services for homeless people or prisons however under current law surplus property cannot be made available to certain nonprofit organizations habitat for humanity and food banks for example do provide services to the homeless but this is not their exclusive mission they also provide services to needy individuals who are not homeless and consequently are ineligible for surplus property making federal surplus property available to these organizations would greatly assist them in aiding the poor in indiana and around the country it would help the food banks that provide food to shelters soup kitchens and food pantries groups that recycle building materials for use in the repair of housing for the poor and other organizations that repair and build homes for lowincome families h r 2461 would amend current law to make such organizations eligible for the federal surplus program the proposed change in law would not give these organizations preference but just make them one of many eligible nonprofit entities h r 2461 is not controversial gsa has not raised any objections to this proposal federal state and local governments have been looking to nonprofits to assume more responsibility for providing needed services to the poor particularly in an era of declining budgets h r 2461 will help nonprofits provide those services more effectively by granting them access to federal surplus property i think this promises to be a worthwhile use of federal surplus resources i urge my colleagues to support h r 2461"], [0.003383159637451172, 0.49661684036254883, 1, "mr speager i rise today to ask the support of my colleagues for h r 4948 which
