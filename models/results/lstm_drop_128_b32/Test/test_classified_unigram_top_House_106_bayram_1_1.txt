preantibiotic era where no cure for tb was available an effective dots cure program can prevent the development of multidrug resistant tuberculosis a recent world health organization study in india found in areas where effective tb treatment was implemented the death rate from tuberculosis fell by more than 85 percent tb accounts for onethird of aids deaths worldwide and up to 40 percent of aids deaths in asia and in africa eleven million people are currently affected with tb around the world and with hiv the good news is that tb treatment is equally effective in hiv positive and hiv negative

48 percent or over 450 francis saved 60 percent for all of the men and women who went the savings amounted to a significant proportion of their monthly income now i should point out that these persons

months income for 3 months supply she speaks for many seniors when she says do you stop taking your medication to buy food it is intolerable that the wealthiest nation in the world allows this

alternative to a strong bill for political reasons rather than policy reasons we are only partially funding h r 1180 the ways and means majority ignored committee jurisdiction to include medicaid

the two committees the committee on commerce is the one that did not attempt to overstep its jurisdiction republican ways and means leadership claims the administration refused to lift a finger to help find offsets for this bill i was there i can assure my colleagues that this assertion is patently false as a matter of fact the administration helped us identify the very offset that the committee on ways and means refused to accept basically the committee on ways and means majority leadership broke the rules to fund the pieces of the bill they liked and coopted the rules in attempt to kill the sections of the bill they did not like and none of their actions reflects what is best for the disabled community or for american taxpayers the original work incentive act that passed out of the committee on commerce has well over a majority of members of this body sponsoring it h r 1180 funds medicare and medicaid options for disabled individuals who want to return to work it funds a demonstration program the goal of which is to prevent disabled individuals from being forced to leave a job because of a degenerative illness ignoring for a moment what our values as a nation say about supporting the effort to contribute to society let us talk dollars and cents the work incentives bill enables disabled individuals to work instead of being dependent on cash assistance the effect of the bill is to reduce the cost of cash assistance programs knowing they will have health insurance should they return to work disabled people would not need to remain dependent on cash assistance we should be considering full funding for h r 1180 which means we should be considering the commerce bill finally i want to address the issue of offsets the majority cited the fact that offsets have not been agreed upon as a justification for weakening this bill i have to say that concerns raised by the majority are more than a little ironic given their arbitrary application of payasyougo rules the 792 billion tax cut bill had no offsets nor did the 48 billion tax cut for buying health insurance both bills are touted as helping one population but in reality help another the tax bill ostensibly would provide the bulk of the tax cut to those americans who make up the majority of the population and happen to need the money that is to low and middleincome families simply not so the access bill ostensibly would expand access to those most likely to be uninsured and least able to afford coverage again not so these bills generally skip over those in need of help and help those with influence in contrast the work incentives act which we know would actually help the intended beneficiaries people with disabilities apparently has been slashed by the committee on ways and means for the lack of considerably fewer dollars in offsets apparently there is one set of rules for bills that aid americans with money and power and another set of rules for those bills that help

give us the money to file this lawsuit they said wait a minute where is your authority for that they said well look at section 109 of the 1995 state commercejustice bill where it says that agencies can reimburse the justice department for representing them in court and they dragged the money out of those agencies and filed this lawsuit well that statute that they are talking about is the crux of what we are h50 talking about here today that statute merely says that the government can be represented in court when it is sued that was the intent of the congress no to be the suer no one told the congress that they had done this we had to find it out on our own and we did so the department of justice the place supposedly where the nations morals are protected the place where moral authority resides in this government if anywhere itself is the one that is thwarting the will of the congress that is twisting words for its own purposes that is clearly violating the intent of the congress in passing the act in the first place why was it passed in the first place the government was sued a huge multibillion dollar suit by the contractor for the navy department when we canceled the a12 aircraft contract in 1995 justice says please congress help us allow the defense department to pay us back for representing them in defending this lawsuit and we said we think that is a legitimate purpose and we wrote it into our bill that is the statute they are trying to use we all know my colleagues know that that statute is for defending the government not suing willynilly why because we provided in this bill 147 million for them to bring lawsuits 1 034 lawyers we hire there to file lawsuits we are paying those lawyers to file lawsuits this statute is for defending the government not suing and yet they would have us believe that this great moral authority at the justice department is right i say to my colleagues the question here is not the merits of the lawsuit or any other lawsuit the question here is the merits of the morality at the justice department does the end justify the means they say yes i say no is this a nation of laws or of men i say laws and the congress better say laws theyare taking your prerogative here down there and they are using it as they choose i say to my colleagues reject the justice departments grab of other agencies money but more importantly the justice departments seizure of power away from the congress never was it intended in this congress in the passage of this statute that it was to be funding lawsuits filed by the government no one ever anticipated that or thought about it when we passed the act the intent of the congress is being clarified in our bill and that is this statute is for defensive purposes only reject the waxman amendment that would legitimize and reward a justice department that has seized your prerogative and is acting like they are the law themselves and we do not matter well the end does not justify the these means i urge my colleagues to tell the justice department to obey the law"], [0.99733567237854, 0.99733567237854, 0, "i yield myself the balance of the time i want to agree with

important fisheries for recreational anglers especially within the sixth congressional district of new jersey as a senior member of the subcommittee on fisheries conservation wildlife and oceans i have a long history of involvement in protecting preserving and enhancing the striped bass in fact i have sponsored legislation to designate the striped bass as a federal gamefish this bill would prohibit the com mercial harvesting of striped bass and reserve this resource for recreational catches only therefore ensuring a healthy sustainable rec reational fishery the recovery of the striped bass fishery since the crash of the late 1970s is a example of successful state and federal cooperation and angler support over the last two decades bythe numbers the atlantic striped bass fishery appears to be thriving and healthy but maintaining these harvests will require continued coordination and careful management the 199899 harvest data show a harvest increase for both commercial and recreational fishermen over previous years in fact harvest levels have been increasing steadily since the moratorium on striped bass fishing was lifted in 1990 in its 1999 report to congress the atlantic states marine fishery commission states that the 1999 stock assessment revealed cause for concern that striped bass were fished above the target level in 1998 and of particular concern was the finding that fishing mortality for older age 8 and up fish exceeded the definition of overfishing in 1998 these age 8 and older fish represent the most important age class for recreational fishermen and provide a large percentage of the spawning biomass while these stock assessment figures raise concerns about the harvest of larger fish the fishery does not appear to be in danger of collapse in the near future however i believe we avoid that potential threat of a collapse in the future in 1979 congress first authorized the emergency striped bass study as part of the anadromous fish conservation act to addressthe problem of declining striped bass stocks this legislation was later expanded by the atlantic striped bass conservation act of 1984 which ensured that the states would comply with a coastwide fishery management plan since its inception this bill has been a positive step in managing the atlantic striped bass fishery it is for that reason that i support passage

the farm economy in north dakota i have with me today some auction bills we have been seeing a lot of these auction bills consider that each auction bill represents a sale of a family farm the end of literally generations of tradition of farming the land it goes on for pages recently ag week periodical which covers the red river valley the most prosperous part of agriculture in my state published 150 farm auctions this is 150 individual operators throwing in the towel ending again the tradition handed down for generations of making a living off their land in each case it is a tragedy and something to be avoided one friend of mine and i am going to offer this for the record who is selling out after 120 consecutive years of production on this family farm wrote an oped to the newspaper and he has on the title of it now at least we do not have to wonder anymore there are an awful lot of families wondering tonight whether or not they will be able to get a crop in the ground this spring imagine we all deal with career uncertainty surely as members of the house up for election every other year we really never know until the election is over what we are going to be doing but we have people at this late point in the spring not knowing whether they will be able to put a crop in the ground right now obviously if they cannot get the financing to get a crop in the ground they have no idea what they are going to do to put shoes on their kids feet to put food on the table we have got a fullblown crisis in agriculture directly related to the financing capital farmers need to get their crop in the ground this spring for that reason the administration advanced several weeks ago emergency funding requests so that we might have additional loan authority funded the request is for 152 million and it is part of the supplemental appropriations bill sent up by the white house 109 million of that would make 1 1 billion in additional lending authority available to farmers 42 million so that the usda could actually hire additional staff to process these applications and get the money out here is what has happened in light of the collapse in commodity prices farmers have had terrible losses as they sit down with their regular bankers they are unable to show cash flow and therefore unable ineligible in many cases for the financing that they had otherwise expected now there are programs available for these farmers fsa lending programs direct lending programs usda loan guarantee programs but because so many have had trouble in lending in the normal course they have come to the usda and overwhelmed the resources available for those usda loans right now north dakota we have a backlog we do not have enough money to meet the loan need now and it is anticipated that that loan need is going to increase dramatically over the next few days there is 4 4 million in unmet loan need that has come into the north dakota fsa offices over the last 2 days alone this is a crisis and it is a crisis with a very narrow window of time for us to address if a farmer cannot get the crop in the ground in the spring the money coming along here in july or august is not going to do a lick of good the window is gone they have lost the chance to plant and for these operators that means they have lost the farm i would say to my colleagues please let us move this supplemental appropriation request along everyone knows of the urgent straits in farm country not just in north dakota or south dakota but throughout the country and we must respond to this by getting that loan guarantee money replenished so that it can get out to the farmers so they can get their crop in the ground this spring so they dont lose their farms it is as simple as that it is very straightforward

rise to begin by complimenting my very good friend and classmate the gentleman from kentucky for the work that he has done on this bill it has been as we all know a very difficult measure dealing with the constraints that have been imposed by the 1997 budget act ahd i believe that he has done a superb job and i am happy to report as mr rogers well knows that we in the committee on rules have done exactlywhat he requested of him we provided an open rule plus we in fact under this open amendment process will have every germane amendment allowable to be debated and considered and we added three additional legislative amendments which address some concerns that a number of members had raised to it so i believe that this is a very very fair and appropriate way in which to deal with this important issue i also want to congratulate the gentleman from new york of the minority who came forward and made the exact same request of us that the gentleman from kentucky did in his testimony before the committee on rules let me talk about the bill itself and a couple of provisions that i think are very important last week we had a very rigorous debate here in the house on the issue of whether or not to maintain normal trading relations with the peoples republic of china and during that debate i was happy to briefly raise an issue which is very important in our quest for political pluralism and democratization of the peoples republic of china and that is the support of the village election process now more than 2 decades ago mao tze tong was a supporter of the idea of village elections and yet at that time there were only 9 communist candidates in the peoples republic of china who were running today through the efforts of the national endowment for democracy which is funded in this bill and the work of the international republican institute one of the core groups associated with the ned the national endowment for democracy and i am privileged to serve on their board we have been very very key to promoting those village elections in the peoples republic of china i am happy to say that today over 500 million people in china have been able to participate in local village elections that is why i think that while it is a relatively small amount in the big picture the support for the national endowment for democracy is very important because we have the private sector involved with this and as i said several other core groups so i congratulate my friend from kentucky for putting that in the bill and maintaining strong bipartisan support for it i also want to mention one other issue that is of very great importance and i see my colleague the gentleman from california to us and it is dealing with what is known as scaap funding we have in california a problem with the tremendous cost burden imposed on californias taxpayers for the incarceration of illegal immigrant felofs people who are in this country illegally and commit crimes in fact one of every five prisoners in state prisons in california happens to be someone who is in this country illegally so we all recognize that it is not the responsibility of a single state to protect the international borders it is the responsibility of the federal government to do that that is one of the reasons we have said when we have problems protecting the boarders the responsibility for the consequences of that should not be shouldered by the state taxpayers of one particular state that is why this scaap funding provision is very important and again it enjoys bipartisan support and i am

national treasures in fact last year these institutions were collectively placed on the list of our nations most endangercd historic sites by the national trust of historic preservation that action was a great testimony as great a testimony as can be given to what we ought to be doing in this body to preserve and protect these schools and their campuses i hope this resolution is the beginning of

two categories of our defense the first is our domestic defense our domestic defense relies on the 32 000 organized departments that are in every rural town in america in fact as my colleague knows pennsylvania has 2 600 of these rural fire and ems departments they are in every small town in every county in this nation in montana in idaho in alabama in arkansas in hawaii in new york california they are there and 1 2 million men and women 32 000 departments 85 percent of them are volunteers in fact they are the oldest volunteers in the history of the country older than america itself now the important thing is what has this administration done to these people who are serving america who are responding to floods tornadoes earthquakes hazmat incidents and fires well they have cut the only program for rural fire departments which has been authorized at about 20 million a year this administration cut it last year to this year from 3 5 million to 2 5 million what a disgrace the president sneezes and spends more than 2 5 million a year yet this administration has done nothing for rural fire departments now why should they well these people lose 100 of their colleagues every year that are killed name me one other volunteer group from america where 100 of their members are killed in the line of duty they have ordinary jobs but they are killed protecting their towns and their communities but this administration they claim they are for volunteers we saw them develop the americorps program is that not amazing a 500 million program supposedly designed to help create volunteers but guess what the volunteer fire service cannot apply because it is not politically correct to fight fires and respond to disasters so here we have an administration that is so insensitive to our domestic defenders that they created a halfabilliondollar program giving scholarships incentives for people to volunteer but they cannot volunteer in their communities especially the rural communities where they so desperately need people to man those trucks and their ambulances this administration just does not get it now harris wofford the head of that program just called me today and they now want to do something after the program has been in existence for about 6 years because they realize how insensitive they have been the gentleman from pennsylvania"], [0.00516277551651001,

one more time is it true that those who cheered bill clintons reckless and irresponsible veto of the republican efforts to eliminate the marriage tax penalty want to raise taxes one more time we can balance the budget we must balance the budget without the clintongore tax hike let us not forget that bill clinton al gore and house democrats gave america our biggest tax hike in history in 1993 our goal as republicans is to wall off the social security trust fund to stop the raid on social security because we believe 100 percent of social security should go for retirement social security and medicare we can save social security we can help our local schools we can lower the tax burden by eliminating the marriage tax penalty we can pay down the national debt all without raising taxes all without dipping into social security no more tax increases no more raids on social security let us balance the budget let us bring spending under control"]]}
