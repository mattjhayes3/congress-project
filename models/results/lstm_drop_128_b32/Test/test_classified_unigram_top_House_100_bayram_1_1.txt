authorization committee whatever you might have a problem with we will waive any and everything just bring it to the rules committee and we will flush you right on through let me tell my colleagues what this rule waives it waives the budget act it waives legislation on an appropriations bill it waives availability of the bill for 3 days i mean we really do not want to know what is in these appropriation bills do we why should we need 3 days or 3 hours three minutes is probably all we really need of course we waive the rule that requires that hearing committee reports be available for 3 days we waive the 302 c which prohibits the rule because it prohibits consideration of legislation from a committee that has not filed its 302 b suballocations i do not know what is going on in the appropriations committee i thought they were ready to file those suballocatlons days or weeks ago apparently there is some wrangle up there but do not worry about it the rules committee will take care of it we will waive any requirement of that nature that might be imposed by 302 c it also waives of course the fact that we have numerous instances of unauthorized appropriations in fact it was interesting as i looked over the bill the committee apparently pays no attention to what was requested what was authorized they go up in some areas down in others i could not figure out what the rhyme or reason to it was but that is all right we waive that too then also in section 2 of the rule we lay the hud housing and urban development appropriation bill on the table i do not see any great damage being done with that we lay the rule on the table i have not seen it done before in all of the years i have served on the rules committee i guess it is so that a member of the rules committee will not call up that rule after a certain number of days and since the gentleman that is chairman of that subcommittee is involved in hearings over across the capitol that we did not want it just sitting there until he could come back and handle the rule so i do not have any big objection to it except it is unusual and now the rules committee will have to go back and have another hearing and grant another rule let me talk about the bill itself this subcommittee of the appropriations committee the military construction subcommittee as is the usual case does a better job than any of the other subcommittees of the appropriations committee their level of spending would be 8 1 billion and that is 1 8 billion below what the president asked for and very close to last years level there is some dispute over that i had seen a figure that it was actually 70some million under last years level and i have seen a figure now that says it is 140something million over last years level it is very close and i guess it depends on whether you count the previously appropriated funds as to whether or not it is right on it right above it or right below it but overall the subcommittee did a good job in fact this subcommittee probably did too good a job this is the only subcommittee of appropriations that i have seen that has kept spending down it is probably the only one that should have allowed some spending to go up the rest of the bills have been 1 2 billion 1 8 billion 2 billion several hundred milion over everybodys request and everything else that we are supposed to be using as a guidepost but this one is within range of what was asked for so i must say to the subcommittee they have done their job and done it well so i do not mean this criticism of the rule to be aimed at the appropriators in this particular instance i just think the rules committee is too quick to pass out waivers for every thing and so therefore i oppose this rule i do hope to be able to support the

confrontation in a partisan way almost for the sake of partisanship as a result of that the then speaker tip oneill i believe decided to flex his authority in a direction that went beyond that which is good for the house essentially we began a process known as panning and panning is to use our television cameras to pan the house during special orders when oft times we are discussing very important items of the house and yet there are relatively few members of the house present on the floor they are either in committee or they are indeed in their offices using their televisions to observe the work on the floor and clearing their other legislative business if we are going to have that sort of panning in the house indeed it would logically be argued that one should pan during the

cetera and at a time of critical debate nonetheless there may be few members relatively on the floor we know that is the way the work of the house goes forward the point that i want to make is first that such panning draws a negative kind of attention and misunderstanding to the work of the house it may very well serve to undermine the exercise of free speech of a person in special orders with whom you may disagree but indeed to pan the house without a further explanation does attack the credibility of the workings on the floor that reality was never brought to mind in more crystal clear fashion than recently when we found ourselves working in the house on a memorial in which during special orders we were paying tribute to two of our past colleagues who had served us long and wellsala burton and stewart mckinney having passed away they were being addressed by way of memorial tribute during special orders to go back and look at that tape and see the panning of the house which would imply that few or almost no members cared when indeed endless numbers of members participated in those memorial services with panning it would indicate otherwise it not only affects the credibility of our house indeed it greatly affects the credibility of the words that were given that day on their behalf i might mention the words of one of my colleagues speaking on the floor in behalf of sala burton the gentleman is standing on the floor at this moment the gentleman from new york speaking to the house indicated i think that the entire event from the beginning of moving from the capitol steps out to andrews and then three planes full of people members of the house and others former members included and staff people and the memorial service itself were a tremendous tribute in

this i think has been one of the most unique instances in my experience that is that most of the appropriation bills arc coming out way ahead of schedule in this case we have a subcommittee that has jurisdiction over a wide variety of agencies crucial to the smooth operation of the federal government principal among these is the treasury department which includes revenueproducing entities such as the internal revenue service customs and the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms these entities are also critically involved in the nations war against drugs as is the federal law enforcement training center which is playing a critical role in the training of federal law enforcement officers for this effort also included within the treasury appropriation are such entities as the secret service the bureau of the mint and the financial management service the subcommittee of course has recommended an appropriation to the secret service which is adequate and necessary for the service to meet its critical objectives additionally the bill contains appropriations for the unitedstates postal serviceand this part of the appropriation is known as revenue forgone it is the only area of appropriation that is made to the unitedstates postal service from the federal treasurythe executive office of the president and 11 independent agencies included in this bill are appropriations necessary to effect the transition between administrations and that is a very crucial recommendation and consideration that is made at this particular time in our history every election year generates

difficult question that is before us he is also correct in that the provisions that were added by the senate to our bill are for the most part laudable i would like particularly to concentrate attention for just a moment on the provisions with respect to diplomatic immunity what is it that the people in the other body have asked us to add to this bill the heart of it the heart of the helms amendment is a provision that says whenever there is probable cause to believe that an individual who is entitled to immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the united states may have committed a serious criminal offense particularly a crime of violence the secretary of state shall request the foreign ministry of the country such individual represents to waive the immunity of that individual if such waiver is denied the secretary of state shall declare that individual non grata or insure the removal from the united states we are not talking here about just willynilly kicking out foreign dilomats because some representatives oi the opposition in their country points the finger at some diplomat in this country and asks us to remove him we are talking about probable cause we are talking about serious offenses there are many cases that we all know about where individuals in this country have been harmed by the actions of diplomats from other countries who are immune from our justice system and it seems to me that in that regard at least on this particular provision the senator from north carolina adds something that probably most members of this house would agree with i know that the state department is recommending a veto i am always anmzed by the things that prompt the state departments concerns but i would say that what is contained in this provision in regard to immunity is something that ought to be enacted by the congress i would be personally quite satisfied if the speaker of the house who is in the chamber at the moment and the majority leader of the senate would agree that we would be able to have a separate vote before we adjourn in both houses on the diplomatic immunity question the bill has been pending many leading members on both sides of the aisle have supported that bill and tried to get it to come to the floor so we could act on it that has not happened there are probably better ways to act than to have had this added in the senate on this bill i am as eager to finish the appropriations process as everyone else is i am no happier being here at 10 30 at night debating this than anybody else is but we have to look at it on its merits and on its

unanimous views of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs of the house and the markup transcript shows that this amendment received only one voice vote moreover 33 committee members have circulated a dear colleague letter to underscore their committee votes this kind of opposition from those who specialize in bank and consumer legislation should be a clear sign to the full body that we are looking at something other than greed i hope my colleagues you do not believe that we sit figuring out ways to soak the public rather i hope you understand we have looked at the whole issue of credit cards very closely we have weighed studies by academics and by the regulatory agencies we have not accepted these voluminous studiesuniformly opposed to capsat face value rather we have used our collective judgment using a hearing record i am comforted the editorialists agree with us the new york times and the chicagotribune have written against this amendment many of you might reel at the rates thrown around today in debate yet we have carefully examined the underlying facts credit cards are a multifeature service they provide financial identification when you fly or check into a hotel or when you purchase goods away from home if you loose them or they are stolen under law your maximum liability is 50 per card you have all kinds of rights as a cardholder if you do not like the goods or services you purchased with them the holder in due course doctrine does not apply and on and on moreover the cardholder has many options on how expensive he wants the service to be the holder does not have to use it for credit in most cases he can simply pay his monthly billing in full indeed in that case the bank gets stuck and the cardholder has gotten a financial benefit on float since the purchase moreover there are cost cutting items like grace periods for payment in short credit card rates really are a price for a package of services and only a part of that package is the lending component to be what about the gouging issue credit cards are not excessively profitable the latest comparative federal reserve summaries show that net earnings of bank card plans before taxes average 1 9 percent of balances outstanding from 1972 through 1985 this is significantly lower than the average net returns on major types of commercial bank loans for the same period 2 3 percent on real estate mortgages 2 4 percent on commercial and other loans with figures like that the committee could not just willy nilly sayyou are gauging the public we had to look further why do we sometimes see higher figures in some institutions and not so high figures in others a lot has to do with administration and loss expenses these account for about 60 percent of credit card interest rates losses processing etc cost further we had to consider the cost to the federal government in lost revenue the full deductibility is being phased to zero the federal subsidy for this whole service system is about to end pricing the whole service will change competition will intensify and probably the whole charge for the service will decline well enough those are the things the committee had to consider
