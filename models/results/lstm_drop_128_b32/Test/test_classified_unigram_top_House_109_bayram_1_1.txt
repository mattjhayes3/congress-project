outset the resolution that is before us was drafted entirely by republicans with no input from any democrat from the intelligence committee from the financial services committee or anywhere else and presented to us a little over 24 hours ago we then asked for the right to offer amendments or at least a substitute resolution it was denied i find it extraordinary that repeatedly in the interest and in the name of democracy the majority degrades democracy how can it be justified that no alternative can be offered how can it be justified that no amendment can be offered let me say again we are telling the shiia majority in iraq that in their parliament they ought to make an effort to include the sunni that it is not simply the majority doing everything but you work with the minority you then give through your party the opposite example by not allowing even a resolution to be offered for us to be voted on we have an alternative that is supported by a very large majority of our caucus and now let me talk about that resolution because let us be clear about whatis not at issue today we have agreement that the method of tracking terrorists through their financial dealings is a good thing the democratic resolution which the majority refuses to allow to be considered in their abusive use of their majority says explicitly that we support efforts to identify and track terrorists and their financial supporters so if it isnt unanimous it is the fault of the majority by doing it so divisively we also in our resolution deplore the unauthorized disclosure of classified information but we talk not simply about people who might print it but the people in the administration who might release it earlier today someofie said well what would happen if you gave out the name of spies well ask the people in this administration who gave out the name of valerie plame we hope that something will be done here is the difference between the two resolutions the republican resolution drafted entirely by them and withheld from us until its publication agrees that we should track terrorist financing so does the democratic resolution theirs however includes a number of factual statements that i do not believe we yet have a basis for making now in some cases some of those factual statements are about things that turn out we think not to have been true for example on page 3 of their resolution they have reference to a prior incident in which the washington times was accused of having disclosed classified information regarding efforts to monitor the communication of osama bin laden they dont mention the washington times because they like the washington times they mention the new york times times they are a changing if it is the new york times they dont like it and they criticize it if it is the washington times they talk about a far more serious allegation about the washington times that it gave away to osama bin laden how we knew where he was but they dont mention them but now it turns out they may very well have been inaccurate about that and i plan to submit an article from the washington post that defends the washington times but here is the problem we have we want to say in our resolution and we hoped it could have been unanimous that we support this kind of tracking that we dont want things to be disclosed but what we are not prepared to say and frankly nobody here is intellectually prepared to say it people may say it on faith but here is what they want to say we find that the program has been conducted in accordance with all applicable laws regulations and executive orders that appropriate safeguards and reviews have been instituted to protect individual civil liberties and that congress has been appropriately informed i think that the

increased taxes how can either of those two solutions be the right prescription for getting our fiscal house in order there is no better example of the challenges we are facing than the need to secure our homeland and as you know in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on september 11 our administration and this congress responded in a bipartisan way to create a centralized agency to coordinate our nations homeland security efforts but creating an entirely new agency particularly following september 11 was no easy task at that time the organization of the department of homeland security marked the largest single agency opening in nearly four decades dating back on the creation of the department of energy it also required the reshuffling of 180 000 employees and the transfer of some 22 federal agencies from one area of government control to another a department of this size and scope certainly needs a sufficient level of funding to carry out its goals and objectives and initially

this house the specialness of this house and the specialness of my colleagues i also believe that this time that i will have to share with my colleagues and to share with the american people is a moment for us to be able to move forward and not to recount or to go back over a pathway that is not productive a few weeks ago we were discussing legislation that of its very name is extremely controversial in the course of that legislation h r 748 the child interstate abortion notification act ciana the debate was vigorous and i know that in this congress we have had our differences of opinion as it relates to the question of choice the ninth amendment the right to privacy and in this instance the question of parental consent it is interesting to note that those of us who may side on the position of choice and the right to privacy recognize the intensity and the questions being raised about children who are put in harms way whether or not that means that a child without counsel because of some tragedy in her life has to seek an abortion the vigorousness of the debate centered around the idea of the enormous range of differences of opinion expressed by different states i think they are equally divided 23 22 27 some states having no provisions for parental consent as it relates to a child securing an abortion some states having a very complicated process with judicial review and some states having a medium process the debate in the committee on the judiciary by members on my side of the aisle really centered and focused on the structure of the legislation that seemingly would close the door shut on a child that would seek counsel beyond the parent in this very troubling time in their life it also sought to clarify whether an innocent bystander who could provide a mode of transportation might in fact be held criminally liable under this particular law so there were a number of amendments being offered that would hopefully clarify this very difficult question this is a time when passions rise high temperatures rise high as well as i said there is a vigorous disagreement about this question of abortion and even more vigorous when it involves a child who is under the age of majority e 1745 so there were a number of amendments offered by my colleagues one offered that in particular the description of the amendment simply offered by the gentleman from new york allowed an adult who could be prosecuted under the bill go to a federal court and seek a waiver to the states parental notice laws if this remedy was not available subsequently there was a house report 10951 and in that report a series of amendments were described in particular to give license to sexual predators may i repeat that again to give license to sexual predators i started out by saying and i do intend to follow that charge that i have made that this is an effort to go forward to be able to highlight a mistake an indiscretion a pathway that hopefully we will not return to and allow us to heal on our own if you will but also to cite that this is not the way to run the peoples house that amendment simply stated that it allowed an adult who could be prosecuted under the bill to go to the federal district court and seek a waiver to the states parental notice laws remember i started out by saying state parental notice laws are varying around the nation it was ultimately written to suggest that that particular gentleman from new york had an amendment that would have created an additional layer of federal court review that could be used by sexual predators to escape conviction under the bill it suggested that that roll call that particular amendment was defeated 11 to 16 subsequently there was another amendment by the gentleman from new york to exempt a grandparent or adult sibling from the criminal and civil provisions in the bill again simply stated as plain as can be and by the way though i am not intending to challenge legislation that has already been passed on the floor of the house albeit i disagree with it vigorously in terms of the restraints it puts on the interaction between a child and confidante a trusted adult who can help steer them in the right direction let me just suggest this was a constructive amendment because it was to give the child an ability to consult with someone that may be out of the pipeline and be out of the childs distress area meaning we have never looked at the point that possibly the parent could be the predator or could be engaged in incest all of these are terrible things to discuss but in a responsible debate these were the considerations why these amendments were authored ultimately that amendment to allow a grandparent or sibling to confide or that child to confide in that particular adult or that particular sibling adult sibling it was described by the gentlemans amendment was described as having exempted sexual predators from prosecution under the bill and suggested that it was defeated in a roll call vote subsequently the gentleman from virginia offered an amendment to protect innocent bystanders who might have someone take their mode of transportation a taxicab a bus or other mode of transportation not knowing who they are carrying and ultimately caught up in the legislation and be prosecuted so this was to exempt innocent bus drivers taxicab drivers and others who would be transporting individuals and again the amendment was described as exempting sexual predators a subsequent amendment that limited liability to the person committing the offense in the first degree was ultimately described and suggested that it would aid and abet criminals then an amendment that i offered the amendment was to exempt clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins from the penalties in the bill again to give a young woman a greater latitude of who to seek comfort and counsel from and ultimately that anendment was described ms jacksonlee offered an amendment that would have exempted sexual predators from prosecution under the bill if they were clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins of a minor then though i had two separate amendments one a gao study that would have determined whether this particular legislation was necessary and whether or not the confusion of the states with different bases of determining parental consent whether or not that created an added problem the description in house report 10951 just lumped them all together which reads that would require a study by the government accounting office so in essence my amendment was described as exempting clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins of a minor and suggesting that i was exempting sexual predators and then adding insult to injury if i might use a phrase that i then wanted a gao study completely wrong complete misconstruing of the amendment and of the intent so we had a vote last week that ultimately wound up correcting the language in some form it did not however distinguish that i had two amendments and did not ask for a study of sexual predators who happened to be godparents clergy aunts uncles or first cousins first of all might i say in the prosecution of this particular entity i do not believe that any prosecutor worth his or her salt would allow this legislation to exempt an individual who happened to be a relative who happened to be a sexual predator there is no basis in the bill and if that was the case then it means that the parents the very underlying crux of the bill parental consent it means that the bill also protects parents that are sexual predators if you follow that line of reasoning so this is an attempt to have us go forward and not backwards the amendments were very clear on their face the amendments stood alone the general accountijig office shall conduct a study detailing the impact of the number of unsafe and illegal abortions performed on minors who would be affected by this law you see i have lived through a time when women went to back alleys and a coat hanger was a medical device so i thought it was appropriate that if we were going to pass a legislative initiative that we thought would help secure young lives then we needed to have a study that would determine whether or not it was in fact securing them or endangering them and the idea of course was to suggest that we needed to find out more about the impactof this legislation this ultimately got construed i do not know how as a gao study of sexual predators this is not a nice word to say oil the floor of the house because as we have seen the rash of attacks on our children two young babies killed just in the last 24 hours little precious danielle having been determined and identified decapitated a couple of years ago as cochair of the congressional childrens caucus we were briefed by alonzo washington on that tragic case the cases in florida the cases in texas no one wants to promote the extending of any criminal exemptions for the likes of those who prey on our children nowhere in this gao study would that say that and might i say that the war against sexual predators and child predators and child sexual predators is a bipartisan war it is not a frivolous desire of any of us to stand up against those heinous actors that will go against our children i would not in the least be hesitant to stand alongside of any member in this body and know full well of their undying commitment to weed out ferret out prosecute and incarcerate those individuals with the most evil intent to do harm to our children that is why a number of members took to the floor of the house to express such outrage not because we do not accept the fact that there could be mistakes there are politics in this house games that are played at all times there is vigorous debate on the question of choice parental consent but it was the very fact that something so sacred our children could fall victim to such a divide as we went to the committee on rules we would hope it would have been cleared up through that matter let me also just cite tle other jacksonlee amendment that was plain and simple the prohibitions of this section do not apply with respect to conduct by clergy godparents aunts unclesor first cousins simply to say that they could stand in place for example if there was some achilles heel some failure in the parental structure that this child needed to go outside of the family home a simple process no more no lessso we had hoped that there would have been some solution to this in the committee on rules as i indicated this report was filed thursday april 21 and the accompanying report was 10951 the point that should be part of the rules of this house that i hope that we will as we go forward make really part of our institutional fabric is that house reports from now on or from last thursday on should describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions the committee on the judiciary majority cannot do that in house report 10951 by captioning the five amendments that i mentioned with remarks that would suggest that we are harboring that we are kowtowing playing to sexual predators the opportunity that was given to address this question in the committee on rules was troubling because questions were posed as to why such language was utilized might i say as an aside you realize that the house reports and my colleagues realize the house reports are used in history they are used by historians and political scientists students researchers of all kinds policymakers they are used to tell the story of america that is why we rise to the floor of the house and raise our voices and consent and dissent that is why we pay tribute to americans on this floor that is why each morning we say the pledge of allegiance and the chaplain or one who has been so designated offers a word of prayer it is for all of america to reflect and read it is a document that leaves a legacy that 2 days from now or 5 weeks or 1 year or 10 years from now cannot be changed so to ask the question why or to suggest to my colleagues that i only stand here today to remind you that if we can find any sense of unity in this very fractured nation and divided house and senate i would simply ask that it be adhering to the rules of this body and the simple reporting of the work we do here every day the reason why again i would cite this as an important request and one that i hope the correction of last week will not be simply the correction of that time but it will be embedded that we try and work not to do it again is because when we get on this floor and there are words that are not befitting or becoming of the debate albeit the member did not intend any wrongdoing or missteps but because someone else found those words to be inappropriate we have a procedure called to take the words down why do we do that we do that to pro tect the integrity of this record and i think that is the right thing to do in the furor of debate sometimes we step beyond the pale we are committed we are passionate we believe in what we are standing for and we are americans we stand in debate with our eyes on the flag of the united states and the words in god we trust this nations underpinnings allow us to do so but when sometimes in the heat of debate words flare we are allowed and some will ask that the words be taken down and in the course of the debate and the vote occurs there is a procedure to address that issue that means that we care about the integrity of this process and the written word that will then be there for thousands and thousands and millions and millions and years and years to be reviewed we are owed that kind of respect so this statement today should not be considered an effort to recount or repeat it is hopefully an effort in a moment of evenhandedness to suggest that this kind of mischaracterization not take place anymore in the committees of the house the final reporting and or the committee on rules and that we strictly stick to the conciseness and integrity of the process which is a nonargumentative objective reporting of the work of an individual member and certainly words such as predator and sexual predator and child predator to be thrown in the direction of members who leave their homes and their jurisdictions every day in the backdrop of some heinous criminal act maybe affecting their own constituents maybe some child law because as i was driving on the freeway yesterday in texas because of the amber alert that all of the members of this house were willing to support there unfortunately was a highlight of another kidnapped child from new mexico possibly on the run into texas not knowing whether there was an issue of sexual predator or child predator it was a kidnapped child a child that was vulnerable so it is not something that i personally take lightly and i would just suggest that the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from virginia who raised their voices i would think that their integrity also is wellknown and that to associate their work with that definition is one that is enormously frightening this clarification is used as well when you can find that the entity or the act or the actions have subjected you to public ridicule well a story is a story and this was written about so that will not be able to be taken down there will be articles that would suggest that amendments by the named persons exempted sexual predators we cannot go back to that we cannot pull that down that is in the annals of news that will be able to be researched so frankly i thought it was enormously important that this misdeed be called again to the attention of my colleagues why because i hope going forward we will not do it again allow me to quote from the ranking member of the committee on rules who said that it was not indicated how this was brought to our attention the committee on rules discovered yesterday that the committee on the judiciary report on this very bill which was authored by the majority staff contained amendment summaries which had been rewritten by committee staff for the sole purpose of distorting the original intent of the authors so in essence no one contacted our offices to be able to determine whether or not we actually intended that exemption meaning as the report was being written if it had not been for the staff of the committee on rules we would not have had the opportunity to clear the air i do want to pay tribute to the committee on rules in this instance republicans and democrats who listened to our protest if you will and frankly i had hoped and thought that that matter could be resolved there in the committee on rules the response of the majority of the coinmittee on rules is to stand by it or they stood by those amendments as they were described it appeared as stated by the ranking member that the representations being made in the committee on rules is that one the majority stood by it and two that the alterations to our amendments were deliberate when asked again why such an outoftheordinary approach was taken the majority responded and suggested that it was the tone of the debate that caused such to be done because we oppose the legislation the gotyou game was being played that is why i rise today because i would like to have today may 10 2005 really be the last last day that we would entertain such actions no matter how vigorous the debate in opposition how be it that we would step away from the integrity of this house the respect for the three branches of government and do as was done the exact quote as i understand and i repeat it here the majority offered to say you dont like what we wrote about your amendments and we dont like what you said about the bill that can take us all over the map that is why we are in this place that is why a president of the united states can stand with the georgian people and talk about democracy andhold his head up high because we are allowed to stand on the floor and vigorously disagree in a manner where we will not be punished so i would ask as we go forward that this kind of tone this kind of approach not be utilized i do not know what you would call it but i certainly know that it has no place here so the resolution that was offered and debated on asked for a number of actions i think now i should applaud one of the actions in the emergency supplemental in the rules that were passed last week the opportunity was taken to clarify the amendments i am not sure whether or not any formal apology was made but i imagine that when the record is corrected we have received a response that addresses the historical record of this body so it serves no purpose to ask for an apology today i do think we were a little bit off our mark and i would hope that having not asked for an apology and having not received it and seeking only the straightforward clarification that will be the approach that we will take one that we will be allowed to debate in this body whether it be in committee or on the floor and vigorously disagree and that in that disagreement there will be no punishment the only factor that we should have as the test of whether we are right or wrong or whether or not we prevail is that vote and in many instances the majority now in control of the house the senate the supreme court the executive by one party prevails in the instance of the committee on the judiciary in this occasion on these amendments the majority prevailed the minority however felt passion about the amendments and in fact believes that they were right and i personally believe that two amendments one to do a study of the negative impact of this legislation if it might occur or what dangerous procedures might occur of this legislation where would a child seek to go because they were fearful of getting parental consent that was a sincere amendment to get important facts and giving a child the opportunity to talk to godparents or aunts and uncles or cousins clergy or grandparents was not sinister it was simply to protect lives so i would hope that that would be where we would divide on our beliefs our reasons for the legislation not on how we talked about a bill for there have been many legislative initiatives that have had vigorous talk and members have agreed and disagreed about the vigorous talk but the only criteria for prevailing or not prevailing is that vote not a characterization by someone else that you are the leader of exempting sexual predators saying it over and over again of course may cause some to cringe and it is not my intent but i think clarification is very important and in the course of the battle of that particular legislation you can be assured as it was being debated if the glimpses of the words that were gotten were only that it was something to do with sexual predators that just muddies the water of the good intentions that you might be having and the intent of what you wrote in that amendment it would almost be like those who are abhorring drug cartels and drug dealers that if they were to have an amendment dealing with a gao study determining the extent of drug cartels influence in the united states or the growth of drug cartels between 1990 and 2005 and all of a sudden it was characterized as an amendment for the gao to promote drug dealership and drug cartels you would not want to hear that on the floor but it certainly would be the complete opposite of your intent and it would have mischaracterized the debate where you were standing and trying to determine whether some legislation promoted drug cartels more so than broke them up the constitution allows us the opportunity for three branches of government and i think that this country is unique because of it very unique in its uniqueness we have checks and balances the checks and balances do not purge into the inner workings of each body so we are the holder of our own records and it leaves little room sometimes in another body to go and complain about the workings of one specific body particularly the words that are spoken and so there are no other grounds or no other opportunities to clear the air other than to seek this personal privilege i hope that in the course of this discussion it was not rendered in anger or anguish it was simply rendered to say that what occurred deserved the greater attention of this body and that it was on the brink of abuse and the sadness is that we had to rise to the floor more than once before it was ultimately corrected in the waning hours of last weeks legislative session does that speak well of us it does not the rules committee is a place where we ferret out rules our respective committees is a place where we vigorously oversee legislation and provide our input and insight and our thought processes to do what is right i would venture to say there has not been one committee hearing and markup where some member promoted the criminal elements that would do harm to america and if any thought came to the mind of a colleague that that was the intent of that member i would assure you that the best approach of that particular colleague would be to query that member in that committee room none of us were queried about the question of the intent of our amendments whether or not they had to do with predators child sexual predators sexual predators no one was queried and therefore the interpretation that was attributed to us was purposeful and here on this floor the same courtesy should be extended and if you are misunderstood if you misspeak from the integrity again of this record that would be for all to see someone should query you and give you the opportunity to correct your words or in the alternative when the height ofthe debate is so furious there is a challenge by someone at some point that the words be called out there are a lot of papers here because i am looking at this debate that went on and so i will not add to some of the accusations that were made in the debate going back and forth i am simply going to conclude by asking again that it not ever be done again and asking that we respect the individual rights of members to defend and represent their constituents and to offer vigorous debate both consent and dissent and as well the rightto vigorously disagree on a legislative initiative if we can hold to those tenets and the idea of the constitution which i hold very dear which i will read briefly into the record the sacred rights of mankind a statement by alexander hamilton 1775 are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records they are written as with a sunbeam on the whole volume of human nature by the hand of the divinity itself and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power of course this is high language to talk about the rights bestowed upon mankind humankind that they are not found in paper and this quote is correct but one thing is right as well is that although all is not said and done on the written word it certainly is a parallel to our rights because we look to a written document for our rights we look to the written word we look to the madison papers to determine our rights and therefore the written word is extremely important we have had our say on this and i hope that it has been a deliberate statement we will do work in the judiciary committee in the coming days and weeks and months we will have many opportunities to vigorously disagree i might say we have had many opportunities to agree and i expect that we will find common ground throughout the days and weeks and months democrats and republicans around issues of importance to the nation but when we use this document to exercise our job and to debate vigorously and disagree we should not be cited for what we have said about a bilr or punished because we have said something about a bill that others would not agree with our final act will hopefully be one that is respectful of this house and of this place to the judiciary committee members as we gather on a daily basis weekly basis i believe they will all agree that we have the right to disagree and to debate vigorously in the committee in the rules committee and on this floor again i close by saying i hope never again never again i rise to raise a point of personal privilege under rule ix clause 1 of the house rules this point as did the point raised by my colleague on the judiciary committee from new york mr nadler relates to the malreporting by the republican leadership of the committee on the judiciary with respect to h r 748 the child interstate abortion notification act of 2005 while i appreciate the efforts of the chairman of the judiciary committee for having filed a supplemental report part 2 of house report 10951 i must raise this point of personal privilege nonetheless in drder to emphasize the fact that the accuracy and the veracity of house committee reports carries tremendous weight and implications for the reputation professional record and personal life of members of congress again while the supplemental report to 10951 makes some corrections to the mistakes made in part 1 the report still contains an inaccurate representation of the amendments that i representative sheila jackson lee

take place here today sometimes there are issues of such critical social importance that it is only right that the congress of the united states do this in the open and they did that and for that we should all be very appreciative i just want to leave my colleagues with some closing thoughts perhaps some of the things i started with there are 110 million people just in the united states of america out of 290 million who have s6me sort of illness that potentially could be helped by the use of embryonic stem cells most of those will never be helped by the use of adult stem qells we know that anything other than just the use of adult stem cells in blood tissues has been experimental at best and probably will never work i would encourage everyone to use their conscience as they vote today to think about their constituents at home we talk about life and i do not necessarily want to get into that argument back and forth but the bottom line is there are a lot of lives that are being foreshortened in the united states of america and across the world that perhaps could be lived out to their fullest if that opportunity was given to the individuals involved remember that this research is going on at the private sector level it is also going on at the state level it is even going on to a degree at the federal level there has been 60 million spent over 3 years on this research at the federal level and about 625 million has been spent on adult stem cells at the federal level so the research is going on at the time our ethic standards in this bill and if you read it it is only 3 pages long exceed any ethical standards that have ever existed before including what the president had before the national institutes of health said human embryonic stem cells are thought to have much greater developmental potential than adult stem cells this means that embryonic stem cells may be pluripotent that is able to give rise to cells found in all tissues of the embryo except for germ cells rather than being merely multipotent restricted to specific subpopulations of cell types as adult stem cells are thought to be that is where the science is you can argue all you want but if you do any extensive reading on this that is where the science is these are the stem cells which can make a difference the embryonic stem cells there are discussions of dollars there are no dollars used directly in the destruction of embryos at an in vitro fertilization clinic there are dollars used in the research ultimately but let us look at that let us consider what that is all about at the end when those who have created the embryo make the decision that they no longer need or want that particular embryo the physician has to make a decision about what to do with it there are some options there not a lot of options one of them is to give that particular embryo up for adoption some people do not choose to do that there have only been fewer than 100 so far and i think that is wonderful i think that option should be offered some people may make other decisions but basically it will be one of two decisions if this legislation passes one is to put it into hospital waste warm it up to room temperature thereby destroying it at that point and doing it that way or to be giving it up for research and my judgment is if that is a decision why are we not helping the 110 million people out there who need help as opposed to allowing this to go to hospital waste because it will happen anyhow if you do not like that you better go out and lobby against what they are doing in in vitro fertilization clinics and i do not think that we want to do that there are about 400 000 of these embryos that is probably a low estimate today that is an estimate of about 3 years ago about 2 percent are given up a year that is 8 000 the numbers that are more limited than that are just wrong a lot of people now if this passes are going to be offered the opportunity to give up the embryo for research instead of hospital waste and they are going to make that decision and we will get the kind of work that we need i would just close by saying that 14 out of the 15 diseases that are most likely to kill people in the world are not ever going to be helped hy adult stem cells we need to do this with your vote today you can provide hope to tens of millions of americans and many more

not for 1 minute not for a nanosecond if we are going to dramatically change for the worse the lives of millions of children and families and senior citizens across the country it had better be because we had to not because we chose to and there is no doubt that republicans have now chosen to rob the poor to maintain and create new tax breaks for the rich we are not simply robbing the poor

scratching out desperate signs on rooftops help us the signs said grandmothers brothers nieces nephews newborns the faces of families who could be our families neighbors who could be our neighbors but desperate alone and calling out to the world to see across the country americans answered with one voice we are better than this this is wrong this is immoral this must not be allowed to continue we must take care of our own it is our responsibility it is our duty it is who we are as a people as a country we saw that 100 000 people were trapped in new orleans because they did not have automobiles to escape the flood waters we found that 50 percent of all children in louisiana live in poverty in response to this national revelation republicans have revisited our national budget and made a decision to cut programs from the poorest of the poor while protecting a new tax cut giveaway to the richest of the rich instead of limiting these tax cuts to millionaires the republicans have decided to rebuild new orleans on the backs of the poorest people from the rest of the country this is a moral question not a budget matter the repjiblicans are building the high levees around their threatened tax cuts while letting the flood swamp the programs that matter for the rest of americans this is what the debate is really all about it is about our values as a nation and how they are reflected in how we govern how america should treat its neighbors our fellow americans who by an accident of birth came into this world unable to see or who were born into a family without the means to put food on the table or who had the misfortune to develop alzheimers should we let them starve should we tell their children they will never go to college because their parents cannot pay the tuition shall we turn them away from the hospitals because they cannot afford the care and do not have the insurance or should we as a country decide that in this land of plenty no one should go without basic human dignity as a catholic i was brought up to believe that character is judged by how we treat the least amongst us this budget does not pass that test and my hope is that tomorrow we

dignity instead this reconciliation plan will take away food health care education and the abilityto live in dignity in old age from people who have no other options this budget will proliferate

well but i dont think and i wouldnt presume to siy that a center in my district is the best in the world in endoflife electronics that is simply a call that we shouldnt be making rather than seeking to salvage electronic components congress should be intent on salvaging the process by which we spend tax dollars i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.006644845008850098, 0.4933551549911499, 0, "i can share many of the concerns and feelings that my colleague from across the aisle has expressed when we were growing up we didnt need a lot of organized sports to keep us busy it did not seem there were plenty of activities in the summer to keep us active and when we were in school during the year there were activities to keep us active but nowadays it seems it is very difficult to keep children active in sportsrelated activities unless those are around organized activities as the grandparent of two who are involved in lots of activities themselves i see very much the benefits to them from being involved in baseball and in basketball and in kung fu and other things that teach them skills that will be useful to them all their lives including teambuilding skills it is very important i think that we keep our young people active and that we do all that we can to help them fight against the trends toward obesity that we are seeing in our culture and the trends toward inactivity with children being drawn to watching television and playing on computers instead of getting outside and being involved in great activities that could help them in all manners of their lives so i very much

seen lofty rhetoric for a number of years i personally having witnessed it for 26 since i was first an intern here i have frankly never seen the rhetoric not coincide with the reality more than in this case oftentimes this bill does not eviscerate the endangered species act this bill does several positive things it establishes recovery plans based on biology it establishes recovery habitat

and seen documentation which verifies that suppression of religious freedom throughout our armed forces is a pervasive problem affecting military chaplains from all denominations and religions of particular concern is an incident involving army captain chaplain jonathan stertzbach this chaplain who is serving our troops in harms way in iraq was asked by another unit whose chaplain had to return hometo start chemotherapy after cancer was discovered to serve the spiritual needs of the units soldiersin weekly movement to an undisclosed fob forward operating base during a mission tragically one of the soldiers was killed in action the units commanding officer asked this chaplain to perform the memorial ceremony because he had bravely served the soldiers and risked his own life before the memorial ceremony the chaplain submitted two prayers for review the brigade chaplain attempted to remove the chaplain from praying at the memorial ceremony because he concluded his prayer in the name of jesus christ the chaplain adhering to his conscience and faith tradition said he would not strike the words jesus christ the units commanding officer intervened explaining that chaplain stertzbach volunteered to serve a different unit outside of his assigned unit and placed his life in harms way to provide for the needs of the units soldiers the commanding officer instructed that chaplain stertzbach would pray according to his faith tradition after the incident chaplain stertzbachs story reached the media consequently his answers to the media and the incident surrounding the memorial ceremony resulted in chaplain stertzbachs removal from his chapel this is unacceptab e since the beginning of our nations military chaplains have played an integral role fulfilling the

amendment offered it is vital that congress bring competition transparency and accountability to the credit rating industry and h r 2990 would accomplish just that however congressman kanjorskis substitute amendment retains the anticompetitive status quo and provides no transparency and no accountability the subcommittee amendment offered today has three key components it requires the sec to complete its definitional rulemaking it encourages completion of the voluntarily framework and it calls for hearings on rating agencies before the committee on financial services first the sec has never defined the term nrsro and it has been over 30 years i doubt that the secs illustrious track record on this issue deserves this much faith h r 2990 replaces this vague and undefined system with a registration system and is consistent with the free market principles of our federal securities laws the substitute amendment makes no change to this ambiguous and anticompetitive system second a voluntary agreement offers no real accountability the sec cannot enforce violations of the voluntary agreement by rating agencies that sign it let alone those agencies that are not signatories h r 2990 holds credit rating firms accountable and requires adherence to the credit rating firms stated methodologies third there already have been numerous hearings in the financial services committee in the 108th and 109th congresses no less than five dozens of witnesses have been called to testify before the committee and close to 1 000 pages of recorded and transcribed testimony the financial services committee has been diligent in holding hearings on this important issue in the wake of a seminal failure by s p and moodys in the enron and worldcom scandals we must ensure integrity in the

would like to see that also despite this growth in revenue we have seen an even greater growth in spending and this has got to stop the fact is we can and have cut back on discretionary spending in this congress but in order to really return our budget to fiscal sanity we have no choice but to tackle serious entitlement reform on this flo6r our colleagues from the democratic caucus the other side of the aisle complain about the deficit yet when this republican congress and our republican leadership took a stand to modestly reform entitlements and modestly curb the rate of growth and spending in the deficit reduction act no democrats voted for that bill where were the socalled deficit hawks and the blue dog democrats where were the democrats in the 30something group who say they would do a better job of taming the deficit when it came time to make the tough choices their votes did not match their rhetoric on the deficit in fact when it comes to offering solutions attacks and hollow rhetoric are all we hear from the other side what we do not hear from the other side is a plan of action what we dont hear from the other side is a set of principles what we do not hear from the other side is a strategy for securing our nation while expanding our economy these are truths and sometimes the truth does hurt republicans in contrast have a plan for leading this nation the republican study committee today released its proposal for balancing our budget a recommitment to the contract on america that budget recognizes that we must take serious steps to tame our budget deficit if the democrats had a plan which they do not their plan would include hefty tax hikes on american families and american job creators and that is the only truth that can come out of that you cannot be unwilling to cut spending and expect the deficit to go away our budget recognizes that we do not need more revenue we have never had more revenue but we still have to make tough choices in a world of tough choices we can raise the price of the buffet or we can curb our appetites with our waistlines bulging the choice is clear we must go on a spending diet until our pants fit again we have a plan for trimming down the budget we have a plan for continuing our economic growth we have a plan for strengthening the economic security of american families and i think that plan should include making these tax cuts permanent so people can afford to plan their future and to know what is ahead of them"]]}
