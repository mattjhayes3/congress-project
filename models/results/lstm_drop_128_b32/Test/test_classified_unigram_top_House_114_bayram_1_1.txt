year since jvtas enactment we have witnessed important achievements for example the jvta has reinvigorated americans commitment to protecting our children from cruel exploitation and these children

that human trafficking is not merely an international phenomenon it unfortunately happens all too often in our backyards just as we have heard judge poe talk about t and talk about brooke and the stories could go on and on in fact in my home state of ohio for example each year an estimated 1 000 children become victims of human trafficking and over 3 000 more are at risk ohio is the fifth leading state for human trafficking because of its proximity to waterways that lead to an international border and the 175 interstate that allows anyone to exit the state within 2 hours to almost

georgias eighth district is home to roughly 15 percent of farm credit borrowers in the state of georgia i myself come from an agricultural background as both sets of my grandparents were farmers farm credit has met the credit needs of many of my constituents and maintains an active presence in south and middle georgia where we are leaders in georgias agricultural production for a century farm credit has been providing our farmers ranchers and rural communities with the capital they need to build and grow successfully the centennial anniversary coincides with a time when our agricultural industry is facing significant economic challenges in the past few years our farmers and rural communities have been faced with lower commodity prices increased input costs and unstable and inconsistent international markets all of which are placing strains on our food producers and those who provide essential services to our agricultural industry this not only affects the producers and manufacturers but it also has a tremendous effect on the communities in which they live and work a strong agricultural economy is essential to the health and vitality of the communities i represent in

unreasonable searches and seizures before the government may search our homes seize our persons or intercept our communications it must first make a showing of individualized suspicion the intrusion it requests must be as targeted and as brief as circumstances allow the fourth amendment demands no less that is why we are here today we have learned that the government has engaged in unreasonable searches against all of us it has gathered an enormous amount of information about every phone call in the united states it has deemed all of our phone calls relevant to a terrorism investigation it is intolerable to our sense of freedom today we are acting to stop it the bill before us prohibits the intelligence community from engaging in bulk data collection within the united states this practice the dragnet collection without a warrant of telephone records and internet metadata is the contemporary equivalent of the british writs of assistance that early american revolutionaries opposed and that the fourth amendment was drafted to outlaw it has never complied with the constitution and must be brought to an end without delay the legal theories that justified these programs were developed and approved in secret and that practice must also come to an end there must not be a body of secret law in the united states section 215 says tangible things may be seized if they are relevant to a terrorism investigation the governments interpretation that this means everything is obviously wrong could only have been advanced in secret and cannot withstand the public scrutiny to which it is now subjected the second circuit court of appeals threw out this notion last week and now we must do so as well this bill further requires the government to promptly declassify and release each novel or significant opinion of the foreign intelligence surveillance court in the future if the government advances a similarly dubious legal claim there will be an advocate in court to oppose it if the court should agree with the novel claim the public will know about it almost immediately and the responsibility will lie with us to correct it just as quickly before i close i want to be clear not every reform i would have hoped to enact is included in this bill we must do more to protect unitedstates person information collected under section 702 of fisa we must act to reform other authorities many of them law enforcement rather than intelligence community authorities to prevent indiscriminate searches in other circumstances i will continue to fight for these reforms among others and i know that i will not be alone in taking up that challenge in the days to come but i am grateful that we have the opportunity to take this first major step to restore the right of the

strong support of h r 4084 the nuclear energy innovation capabilities act currently in the united states nuclear power produces about 20 percent of our nations electrical supply and that makes nuclear power the single largest carbonfree power source in the country however our current nuclear fleet is growing older many of the plants across our country are many decades old and rely upon nuclear technology that is even older there have been substantial efforts in the past decade to move towards constructing new nuclear generating units with more modern designs however these efforts have had mixed results there have been construction difficulties regulatory hurdles and financing issues all of which have conspired to delay the construction of new nuclear plants in america some of these hurdles though are unlikely to go away with our current technologies the three mile island chernobyl and fukushima nuclear accidents have repeatedly highlighted the necessity of ensuring our nuclear fleet runs as safely as possible this has led to much of the cost and difficulty of building the new plants i think the answer to these problems can be found in innovative new nuclear technologies the department of energy and many different companies in the private sector are working on new forms of nuclear energy generation that hold the promise of much more effective and much safer nuclear generation stations some of these technologies also address the extremely important issue of the radioactive waste streams that plague our current generation of nuclear plants h r 4084 takes several positive steps to help spur this innovation and deliver these very promising nuclear technologies to market i also want to highlight one additional reason to support h r 4084 as the world makes commitments to move toward a lower carbon future as evidenced by the paris climate agreement it presents an opportunity to american industry to supply lowcarbon power platforms like nuclear power this bill will keep our country on the forefront of nuclear power technology and it is my hope it will empower american industry to be the suppliers of the next generation of nuclear plants throughout the

unfairly subsidizing a paper mill right directly across the border from his constituents in madison maine and caused the furloughing of workers at the madison paper mill and as i just pledged to mr poliquin i want to make sure that ita is doing its job when it comes to identifying and enacting some measures to counterbalance unfair trade practices like that i would agree with my friend from california when it comes to promoting american business that is the job of the chamber of commerce when it comes to making sure that american businesses get the word out and shares information that is something american businesses ought to do but when it comes to unfair subsidies given by foreign governments to their businesses that cause american workers to lose their jobs that is exactly what the ita is designed to do we need trade enforcement we need countervailing duties and we need export assistance the amendment which the gentleman from california has offered looks to be about a 70 percent

the fact that little progress had been made on a longterm 6year bill i am pleased today that i dont have to use the same talking points we did through the actual legislative processwith lengthy negotiations leading up to itpass out of committee a 6year bill which relates to policies that would underlie a 6year investment in our crumbling infrastructure that is the good news it was ultimately a bipartisan effort in the tradition of the committee there is not too much to make partisan about moving goods and people from here to there efficiently except for those who are opposed to the federal government being involved and who luckily dont represent a majority on our committee so that is the good news the bad news is we still do not have the funding mechanism before us so we have to do another shortterm extension also the currently stated objective for funding is totally inadequate i mean america is falling apart it is embarrassing actually these states including many allred republican states14 stateshave voted to raise gas taxes since 2013 to invest in maintaining or in rebuilding their infrastructure or in building out new transportation options to get their citizens and goods out of congestion14 states since 2008 nearly half of the states have taken action to raise more funds the federal government last raised the gas tax in 1993 and we are told any increase in user feesgas tax barrel tax indexation of the gas tax vehicle miles traveledis all off the table we cannot ask those who use the system to pay user fees to improve the system that they use on a daily basis i think the american people are more realistic than that luckily this bill contains a provision that should this congress or a future more enlightened congress decide to allocate additional funds those funds will flow through under the policies set out in this bill and the formulas set out in this bill without any further action by congress as it is really a good idea to avoid coming to congress for anything whenever you can so that is i think a very important provision of the bill there is an ap story today that kind of goes to the heart of this and it talks about the fact that in many states they are abandoning roads and bridges we are not just talking about the rural heartland anymore this has been somewhat commonplace in the rural heartland where they have been saying we cant afford to pave these roads anymore we are going back to gravel we are talking about king county in washington state we are talking about the counties and state areas surrounding des moines iowa we are talking about major urban areas and the fact that since the federal government has failed to invest and to live up to its partnership for major critical urban area projects or major projects for our ports or other choke points on the system states have had to concentrate resources there they have tried to raise more money again with no help from the federal government now they are having to abandon the 20thcentury transportation system i mean that is pretty darned pathetic that we are not holding up our end of that bargain and making any effort to do that so that is the bad news part as the chairman mentioned this bill also includes critical provisions to extend positive train control deadlines with the exception of some portion of amtrak nobody will be able to meet the deadline of january 1 which does mean an extraordinary disruption of the movement of freight and commuter and passenger rail across the united states we have worked very hard with the senate in negotiations and we have a bicameral agreement on the extension it is tough it says we are not going to get to this point again it is not going to be kick the can kick the can kick the can it says that all of the entities that are required to put in place positive train control will put forward a plan for approval with measurable benchmarks over this 3year period and they will be tracked as to meeting those benchmarks during that 3year period so it wont be that suddenly we get to the end of 3 years and we hear from a majority of freight and or passengercommuter railroads saying gee we just cant make it we will know where we are headed and will be able to target our efforts on those who are lagging behind at the end of that yes it will be possible to get another extension but they all will have had to have installed the equipment the reality is that this is an expensive and complicated process and putting in the equipment is obviously the first critical part and turning it on but then it can take up to 2 years to get it certified as operational so we are acceding to that reality in this legislation by saying 3 years and measurable goals to get to the 3 years everybody is up with installation and hopefully most will be operational at that point some may not be due to circumstances beyond their control even though they have made the necessary investments and under negotiations with the secretary of transportation they could get further extensions so that is a very timesensitive portion of this bill i have had many colleagues on my side saying i am really tired of these shortterm extensions i really dont want to vote for another one i have said that this is different we have the policy in placewe dont have the funding yetand we have got this very critical element of

recently there are still thousands of rape kits that remain untestedpotentially hundreds of thousands that is potentially hundreds of thousands of victims whose assailants are never brought to justice left to prey on yet more women last year my hometown paper the memphis commercial appeal highlighted the tragic need to end this backlog once and for all it described a serial rapist who was finally caught by police in 2012 he could have been stopped nearly a decade earlier if only his first victims rape kit had been tested but that kit wasnt and instead he was able to attack five more women over the next 8 years missed opportunities like this happen all across our country every day the trauma inflicted on victims of rape can be compounded when they know that their assailants run free while critical evidence goes untested fortunately efforts are underway to reduce the backlog and they are making a difference in memphis our backlog reached more than 12 000 but police have now opened 488 investigations and issued 90 requests for indictment but testing rape kits cost money more than local law enforcement can afford i appreciate the chairmans and the ranking members commitment to eliminating the backlog and the funding that the committee has provided in the bill but we need more this amendment would increase by not quite 10 percent an additional 4 million and would take it

followed an inspector general report that found the dea paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for information from amtrak that they could have obtained for free i think the choice is clear we should
