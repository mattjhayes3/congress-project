is a very wisely revised version of my original bill h r 3973 which was cosponsored by over 300 members of the house there were certain weaknesses in our bill that raised some questions in the committee on the judiciary and the chairman of this committee and his committee have wisely i think revised my original bill to make it acceptable to the committee on the judiciary and i hope acceptably generally this bill is for the purpose of protecting to a greater extent than is now done the elderly people particularly of this country who are the victims of fraudulent schemes of conspiring people who take advantage of them in various ways our committee the select committee on aging held a hearing on this matter we received testimony and have had several hearings as a matter of fact a dozen or more kinds of fraud have been perpetrated upon the elderly people particularly because some of them have a little money to invest and they are looking for some sound investment somebody makes a persuasive presentation to them and they fall victim to the fraud and lose the money that they otherwise would have preserved so this bill also provides very important procedural changes in the authority of the post office inspector it makes possible for the post office inspector to get access to the substance that is the fraudulent substance or the material that is the basis of the fraud that is about to be perpetrated so it will make enforcement by the postal service very much more effective than it has been heretofore yet it does not grant the subpena power we provided originally in our original legislation it also provides additional punishment to be imposed by the courts upon those who are convicted of the perpetration of these fraudulent schemes so i think i feel morally certain that this measure when it becomes law will to a large extent certainly diminish if it does not prevent the great number of frauds that have been perpetrated by conspiratorial characters upon the elderly people of this country i warmly commend the distinguished gentleman from michigan and his subcommittee upon the excellent job they have done in bringing this measure to the floor i am please to join the distinguished chairman of the house post office committee mr william d fond in support of h r 7044 this legislation which we have introduced together is the result of more than a dozen hearings by our committee on aging which examined various frauds being perpetrated against the elderly i will take advantage of this opportunity to release a report business and investment frauds perpetrated against the elderly a growing scandal which has as its primary recommendation the enactment of h r 7044 the purpose of h r 7044 is to give the unitedstates postal service a greater arsenal with which to fight fraud perpetrated against the aged through the unitedstates mails our committee in the course of preparing this report investigated workathome schemes securities frauds franchise distributorship and commodities frauds and found that such business and investment swindles perpetrated against the elderly are a growing national problem we estimate a minimum of 5 billion a year which could be lost in these ripoffs this is a growing national scandal the report details thousands of case histories taken from committee files such as the following nita brumley of lubbock tex a retired nurse lost some 3 475 she invested in a phony jewelry distributorship arthur shaffer of columbia s c a retired army captain invested 9 000 for certain vending machines and received nothing for his money seventythree year old d h brinson of reidsville n c thought he was dealing with a reputable commodities dealerhe lost 52 000 mr and mrs barney dial mortgaged their home to invest in a plantgrowing franchise they lost 6 500 mr and mrs ed steinleitner from pennsylvania lost 30 000 in a workathome scheme in which they were told they could make money by growing earthworms which the offering firm would buy from them the firm left town with the money without buying back so much as a single nightcrawler the report offers these major conclusions first fraud is a massive problem in our society today and it is growing at a rapid rate second the elderly and the poor are disproportionately represented in the victims of fraud the elderly make up 11 percent of the population but 30 percent of the victims of crimeboth violent and white collar crime third the elderly are especially vulnerable because they grew up in a more trusting era some of them have a little money pl t away many of them are not accustomed to making large investments they have time on their hands and want to keep busy and they have the desire not only to have more money on which to live but to leave a little something for their children and grandchildren fourth the elderly are particularly vulnerable to business and investment schemes which prey on the fear that many of them will not have adequate income to support themselves in their old age in general these fears are real some 25 percent of the elderly have incomes placing them at or near the established poverty line fifth business and investment frauds are particularly prevalent because of the large amount of money involved and because it is often impossible to tell fraud from the great majority of legitimate business and investment opportunities sixth like most other kinds of frauds business and investment schemes make heavy use of the unitedstates mails the fraud usually begins with an advertisement in a local newspaper the victim responds to the ad and does not receive what was advertised often the victim receives nothing at all seventh the primary authority to stopping such frauds rests with the states but few have enacted specific business opportunity statutes eighth the federal bureau of investigation has been increasing its efforts to fight white collar fraud with good results but neither the federal trade commission or the securities and exchange commission are doing the job they once did ninth the unitedstates postal service has done an excellent job through its inspection service to fight fraud but it is understaffed there are only 2 000 postal inspectors in the united states and they spend only 25 percent of their time dealing with mail fraud and false representation cases tenth the unitedstates postal service does not have the authority it needs to do the job congress has invested in the inspection service the responsibility for identifying and prosecuting fraud but has not given the service even that rudimentary investigative toolthe power of subpena 11 penalties imposed in false representation cases are too light and recidivism is a common problem h r 7044 attempts to deal with these problems it is a revised version of my bill h r 3973 which has been cosponsored by over 300 members of the house the bill will help the inspection service by giving them the authority to tender a postal money order and gain immediate access to a product which is the subject of a false representation investigation in the past the postal service was required to send away from the product the crooks knew the procedure typically they would wait 2 months and fill all the orders at once as they were closing down their operation by the time the inspection service got its hands on the product it was too late as i said this bill will give the inspection service immediate access to questionable products this will permit testing and help them to move more quickly and thus prevent many thousands from being defrauded each year another provision of this important bill will allow a unitedstates district court judge to impose fines up to 10 000 for each violation of a judically imposed stop order in other words if a federal judge imposes a stop order and a certain firm seeks to defraud the public by perpetrating essentially the same scheme the unitedstates postal service may ask and the district judge may impose the fines i mentioned this should go far to stop recidivism c this is an important bill i commend mr ford and the post office committee i urge its immediate

these abound throughout the courts while in most of these cases defendants ultimately prevail it is only after spending countless hours of wasted time and incurring substantial legal costs moreover in a few cases plaintifflawyers have succeeded in arguing propositions that defy all notions of commonsense and fairness for example the highest court of new jersey determines that a manufacturer may be liable because it failed to warn product users of a potential harm notwithstanding the scientific impossibility of knowing that the product could cause that harm similarly courts in several states have held that a manufacturer may be liable for injuries caused by a product despite the lack of proof that it actually made the product the defendantsvirually all of whom made or sold their products for profitpass costs of defending these suits the costs of product liability insurance and costs of any claims and or settlementspaid out of pocket on to all of us as consumers thus each of us is paying the price for the excesses currently prevailing in our product liability tort system but not all costs can be passed on as a result the law in its present form unreasonably threatens the continued existence of many manufacturers moreover it places american businesses at a competitive disadvantage with foreign competitors who are not faced with the burdens of excessive productliability expusure in their home markets if unabated product liability may potentially jeopardize the viability of a major portion of the american manufacturing community it was to correct this increasingly pressing problem that last december i introduced h r 5214 the products liability act of 1982 this bill would provide federally preemptive product liability rules that make sense in place of the chaos that now exists h r 5214 was drafted in large part by one of americas leading product liability experts prof david owen from the university of south carolina law school while h r 5214 as written has sustantial support inonetheless believed that input into this remedial legislation should not be confined to the ivory towers of academia rather input from the constituencies most affected is necessary therefore i requested one of the bills principal propqnents the coalition for uniform product liability law to review the legislative proposal and to make recommendations to me on how it might be improved the coalition for uniform product liability law is an ad hoc group of almost 120 manufacturing companies in response the coalition established a technical advisory committee

areas were successful in incorporating the language of our bill as a separate title setting up a loan program for sugar we helped convince the members of the house and senate agriculture committees that a nonrecourse loan program for sugar covering the crop years 1982 through 1985 is essential for consumers as well as producers what the opponents of our sugar program seem to forget is that at least since 1934 it has been formal unitedstates national policy that domestic unitedstates farmers shall annually produce 50 to 60 percent of our nations sugar needs tis bill simply provides the mechanisms to insure that this national policy continues by allowing farmers to provide tile sugar without being helplessly exposed to the uncontrollable hazards of a world sugar market supplied exclusively by exporters operating under foreign governmentassisted sugar programs if we are to terminate or change our national sugar policy our farmers deserve proper notice not merciless slow strangulation from vacillating yeartoyear uncertainty by the federal government after all sugar is one of the nations major crops it ranks 10th in terms of acreage and even higher in dollars returned to the farm economy we have nonrecourse loan programs for most major crops sugar deserves the same consideration it has been charged that this is a provision to benefit the large sugar conglomerates the critics conveniently overlook the fact that as many as 100 000 farmers and ranchers are directly dependent on the domestic sugar industry for their livelihood the conglomerates get paid for processing not for growing the cane and beet sugar growers get paid for what thley produce many of them live in the third district of nebraska in 1980 they produced 1 777 000 tons of sugar beets this production was sixth highest in the nation making the sugar beet crop a vital part of the farm income upon whichl the economy of the state depends those who would seek to delete the sugar section from the farm bill are intent upon making this nation a have not nation as far as sugar is concerned we are presently the only major sugar producer that does not have a legislatively mandated sugar program without this protection there soon may be one less sugarproducing nation we see the evidence of a steady loss of sugar processing plants as the industry is asked to continue its operation without a sugar program without our domestic producers it would be necessary to import all of the sugar we use presently domestic producers meet about half our needs the rest is bought on the socalled world market that market is volatile and unstable in the absence of a dependable domestic industry we could find ourselves at the mercy of foreign interests who could manipulate the market for their own gain we need look back no further than 1974 for a clue as to what can happen when we are not fortified with a viable program the price of sugar on tile grocers shelves reached at least 45cents a pound the chlances of this happening again are greater by far without a program for our domestic producers when it does we will have more have nots among the consumers who will not be able to purchase sugar at inflated prices our past experience has shown that sugar prices are more stable and reasonable in the united states when a domestic program is in effect you need only look at the years 1934 through 1973 when a sugar act was in force to see the consistent stability compared to 1975 through 1976 when we had no program and raw the domestic price double for 3 years 1977 1978 and 1979 a sugar loan program was operating the average price during these years was about half what it was in 1980 when no loan program was offered it would appear to be clear that the best possible arrangement for consumers and producers alike is a nonrecourse loan program for sugar as incorporated in the language of h r 3603 despite the propaganda to the contrary this is not a costly giveaway instead experience has shown that little of the sugar under the loan program is forfeited and even when it is the government has been able to not only recoup its investment but to realize a profit on it as

the udallobeyreuss substitute tax package to the house of representatives last week and because of the very hectic nature of that day did not have time to insert all of my remarks into the record while my plan was defeated there continues to be interest in the package that mr obey and mr reuss and i put together in light of the outcome on the taxcut vote i wanted to insert this edited version of my remarks today some 144 members of the house voted for the tudallobeyreuss plan i want to take this opportunity to share this full record of my comments with my colleagues as well as with my constituents in southern arizona let me take you back 4 years because i want to make two points first in march of 1977 we had a new president in town we all said give the new guy a chance and he went on television to tell us he had a comprehensive energy program to deal with the countrys priority problem hie sent the plan to the congress and said could we please vote yes or no up or down as soon as possible surely in the next few months and send it back to the white house by the august recess but there was no billnot in august 1977 not even in august 1978 the bill that was finally approved in october 1978 was pretty badly mangled at that now let us move to 1981 we have another new president in town and most americans have been saying let us give him a chance by april he comes before the congress to tell us that our economy and our energy policy are both in a mess and heres his huge and difficult and complicated program to clean it up could we please act quickly and give the president and the country some answers preferably before the august recess well we have heard about our democratic leadership stalling or falling to move quickly it is a bum rap we have worked hard and we have dealtwith budget cuts of historic size now we have given a president a program based on dangerous farreaching unprecedented economic assumptions not in 18 months as was our response to president carter but in 16 weeks i have watched with increasing dismay these last few weeks as the leadership on the republican side rallied around the president almost unanimously without asking the kind of tough questions about his policy that were askedno demandedof president carters and some of my democratic friends many of them played a new round of a tired old game called my tax cut is bigger than your tax cut any number can play but this year the stakes were extraordinarily high and our countrys whole economic foundation is at stake again let me return to 1977 because there is another parallel there to what we face in 1981 back in 1977 when jimmy carter and his new team came to town they told us that they had promised during the campaign to balance the federal budget and that this pledge would be kept but they had just looked at the new numbers and they said well hold on we simply can not do it after all in 1977 or 1978 and actually 1979 did not look promising but they would guarantee that by 1980a new election yeara balanced budget would be a reality as it worked out we had a 60 billion deficit now here we are in 1981 the president and his team with david stockman in charge tell us that they promised to balance the budget and its a pledge that will be kept but they just looked at the new figures and they can not do it in 1981 or 1982 anid 1983 does niot look all that great but you can be sure that it will be balanced by 1984which happens to be a new election year now they have even backed away from that saying 1984 does not look so hot either maybe 1985 we can not wait that long i sense a real and dangerous skepticism in america today people really question whether the congress is doing anything or can do anything about the economic mess we are in or whether we are going to be serious about helping turn this country around i believe that noth~ing would do more to return confidence to our people and our financial and investment institutions than a balanced budget now i am not alone in that belief the noted wall street economist henry kaufman has declared to fight inflation head on the ne ed is for the government to achieve a balanced budget in fiscal 1982 this would chop inflationary expectations and of equal importance would reduce the role of the government as a powerful demander of credit thereby freeing savings to finance the private sector our substitute was the only bill in the house or senate which could have achieved that goal of a balanced budget and it would have done it without mirrors or rash assumptions and it did not touch the national defense approprations we have already approved our bill did not try to outpromise the gop we were not competing to see who could give the mnost to th oil companies or to investors who straddle the commodities market we did not seek to engage in a bidding war what our bill sought to do was this first to bring interest rates down and to begin the process now this year the reagan administration is budgeting 106 billion for interest on the national debtthe third highest item in the budget the 1982 budget depending on whose figures you use will have a deficit in the 50 billion to 60 billion range we need to take government out of the business of outbidding businesses and individuals in the financial markets in this way we can free the capital that our country so desperately needs for productive enterprises our measure sought to drastically reducc outlays for interest on the national debt mr kaufman agrees here as well in business week of july 13 1981 he said if the reagan tax cut is in place by october 1 we face a new significant increase in interest rates second our proposal sought to raise 6 billion through tax reforms including the elimination of the oil depletion allowance and of commodity tax straddles the revenue loss would have amounted to 13 billion in fiscal 1982 but the estimated budget surplus for the year would have been 2 billion and 20 billion by fiscal 1983 third the same tax reforms would have provided the money to give americans an honest tax break phased in during 1982 it would not have been a tax break financed with borrowed money which was part of the administrative plan that the house approved under the plan that is becoming law taxpayers making 15 000 a year or less or 41 percent of the total tax filers will get 8 5 percent of the 1982 tax cut but people making 50 000 or more a year or 5 6 percent of the population will get 35 1 percent of the 1982 tax cut who are we helping let me digress for a moment and relate to you an imaginary conversation between dave stockman and a taxpayer it reinforces some points ive tried to make dave stockman walks out of the white house and bumps into a man on the street who makes 15 000 a year is married and has two children the man introduces himself and recognizes stockman how are things going asks the man not bad replies stockmnan i have good news for you what a tax cut stockman answers terrific says the man how much will a guy in my bracket get youll get about 150 says stockman yeah answers the man well thatll get me through a 40 pair of jordache jeans for my teenage daughter a 15 pair of tennis shoes for my boy maybe a 30 night out for my wife and i i can buy two tanks of gas for 30 and have 35 left over for the supermarket not terrific but better than nothing frankly mr stockman the thing that really pleases me is that you guys apparently have balanced the budget after all these years and youve got money left over to cut our taxes well i have to be honest says stockman we havent balanced the budget instead the deficit has gone up from 40 billion to around 60 billion and if our program works the way this mr laffer out in california says and if our best case assumptitons carry we are going to have another 128 billion in deficits before 1984 hey really says the man then where will we get the money for me and other americans to have a tax cut stockman says well borrow it when i was a congressman i used to call that printing money or monetizing the debt but isnt interest a big item in the federal budget this year asks the taxpayer i heard its something like 80 billion well yes thats right and well have to have some more interest payments even larger ones next year if we have that additional 60 billion deficit i mentioned in fact weve already budgeted 106 billion just to pay interest next year wont all of that cut down the money supply that we need for capital investment in homes and buildings and all the rest said the man i suppose says stockman but dr laffer and jack kemp say weve got to try this for 3 years first ive got to leave mr stockman says the taxpayer but it seems to me wed be a lot better off if we passed up a tax cut this year and got inflation under control and interest rates lowered and moved quickly toward a balanced budgetand then talk about tax cuts end of story except that i want to add that a cbsnew york times poll of february supported by other polls in more recent weeks showed that by a margin of 7~0 to 23 percent people would rather have a balanced budget before a tax cut if we are going to go into debt and drive up the cost of interest on the national debt by having tax cuts at least we ought to put that money almost all of it we allocated into getting productive assets built and installed and giving people jobs and creating long term economic activity instead what we have adopted as public policy on which all our hopes rest is that not only is there a free lunch but we will give you a bonus for eating it it is a little like going to see a doctor dr reagan says we have diagnosed your condition and run all the tests we find that you have a strange combination of symptoms some of our tests show that you suffer from serious highblood pressure and other tests show that you suffer from serious lowblood pressure what we are going to do is give you two kinds of medicine a pill for lowblood pressure for the right side of your mouth and a pill for highblood pressure for the left side of your mouth swallow both of them fast and you will be well by the next election it will not work george bush was right when he called it voodoo economics in heated debate there are often key facts in dispute let me give you one which is not disputed for all the talk by candidate reagan about balanced budgets and all the talk by president reagan about balanced budgets the administration holds no hope for a balanced budget until 1984or maybe 1985 according to the administrations own optimistic figures and accepting all their assumptions we are promised at besti emphasize at bestwe are promised another 128 billion in new budget deficits over the next 3 years the numbers are stunning computer folks have an old saying garbage in garbage out what they mean is that if you give your programer bad information the computer will give you bad results let me touch on three of the major assumptions we are offered as a guarantee that this untested program is somehow going to work a taxcut multiplier of 5 as against previous history in our nation and others of 2 being the best result you can expect but the assumption in the reagankempstockman plan is 5a multiplier of 5which has never happened anywhere in the free world as far as i know even rudy penner of the american enterprise institute noted there is no reason to think that a kemproth cut has 2 3 or 4 times the power of any other tax cut we have tried the white house assumption that interest rates will drop to 9 percent by the end of 1982 check with your banker and ask him if he believes that inflation will be running at 6 2 percent by christmas 1982 and will drop even lower after that there is an old story about a politician who visited a small town gathered voters in the town square and let fly with a long speech that detailed his program when he finished he paused then declared ladies and gentlemen thems my views and if you dont like emn then ill change em if the standard economic assumptions do not give the right numbers dave stockman simply changes the assumptions but they are phony they are wrong and they will not prove out you cannot even find people on wall street who believe that a magic economic elixir has been discovered who says some samples irving shapiro chairman of the du pont co in the wall street journal of march 9 1981 all weve got to rely on is an economic theory no businessman can run his company on an untried business theory and neither can a government sam nakagama chief economist for the investment firm of kidder peabody in the journal of commerce february 11 1981 when a republican treasury secretary calls for tax cuts to be enacted before expenditure cuts and amid double digit inflation and a rearmament program it is an invitation to financial disaster and from the republican ranks senator barry goldwater quoted by the associated press in the tucson citizen february 13 1981 i dont think it kemproth will work although i know thats not a popular thing to say i dont think reducing the average income tax by 20 or 200 is going to make a great deal of difference senator howard baker t he tennessee republican and distinguished h 6008 co senate majority leader on face the nation august 2 1981 what were doing is really a riverboat gamble were gambling that this new economics will work a real basic point in all of this is that the udallobeyreuss plan would have attacked high interest rates and provided for a balanced budgetnot with gimmicks or a riverboat gamble but with a sound and solid approach we had a chance to enact a plan with a real assurance of a balanced budget and we voted for one with a real assurance of 128 billion more in deficits now we must go ahead with what we have and i will do my part to help see that the reagan plan works but i doubt that it will year after year the american people have demonstrated that they want a balanced budget and yet when the time came we gave the taxpayers more deficit spending i fear we have played a cruel trick on the nation and that we may pay dearly for it in the years ahead"]]}
