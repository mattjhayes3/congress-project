commission ban on the rsle of certain childrens sleepwear the history behind this bill gins in 1971 when the consumer product safety commission cpsc issued regulations containing flammability standards for childrens sleepwear at the time it issued the standards the cpsc knew that those who produced the childrens sleepwearand material for such sleepwearwould treat the fabric with a chemical named tris in order to meet the flammability standard the cpsc also knew that the safety of the chemical for that use had not been adequately tested nevertheless the cpsc issued the standards and as expected the producer used tris to meet the standard six years later new information developed that tris was a carcinogenic chemical on april 8 1977 the cpsc based on this information banned the sale of all tristreated childrens sleepwearand material for such sleepwear as a result of this ban all tristreated garments and fabrics were withdrawn from the market losses were incurred by retailers distributors manufacturers converters and producers of childrens sleepwear and fabric who as the result of the original cpsc flammability standards had flameproofed their products by the use of tris i emphasize that this bill does not grant any of the claims made by those who suffered due to the ban on tris this bill simply allows the claimants to have the court determine whether their claims are valid only if the court determines that the claims satisfy the standards set forth in the bill will any compensation be paid i also want to emphasize the provisions included in this bill which answer most of the concerns regardink the legislation first s 823 as amended requires that a claimant prove that he has lawfully disposed of tristreated products before he obtains compensation this is to guarantee that none of these garments inadvertently end up being used by children second 8 823 as amended prohibits any recovery by a claimant who knowingly exported tristreated products after june 14 1978 when the cpsc ban on the export of those products was announced third s 823 as amended requires that any claimant who received small business administration loans or guarantees due to losses resulting from one ban on tristreated products must repay from any compensation under this bill any amounts still owed the sba moreover to assure that these amounts are repaid to the sba the bill provides that the amounts owed by deducted from the compensation before it is paid to the claimant finally s 823 as amended states that this legislation does not constitute an admission of liability by the united states for any personal injuries the users of tristreated products may later claim this is a carefully crafted bill it would provide a method of compensation for those who actually suffered losses due to governmental actions at the same time it assures that the only persons compensated are those who actually suffered losses due to their good faith attempts to comply with government regulations this is a good bill this is a fair bill i urge its passage i insert in the record at this point a short explanation of s 823 as amended purpose the purpose of the proposed

to be in control of these huge expendituresthese billions of dollarsthat we are authorizing for defense congress or the pentagon the answer to that is simple enough control will rest where it always has in the congress once a multiyear contract has been authorized the department of defense must come back every year to report to the comnmittees on armed services and to request funding from the committees which appropriate the money i can assure you that the armed services committee as mother to this child is going to follow an~y proposed project through the life of the contract and i feel

currently working closely with the dod to test fully the use of multiyear contracting authority in major weapons bystems acquisitions along the lines recoinn~ended by the commission on government procurement we believe very strongly that the dod should be allowed to test multiyear contracting commencing with their fiscal year 1982 program in order to capitalize on their substantial planning efforts currently underway we support a repeal of the present 5 million cancellation ceiling which restricts dods use of multiyear procurement public law 94106 this would permit a more meaningful test without requiring advance approval on a casebycase basis dod accounts for about 70 percent of the federal governments purchases their purchases though are different from those of other agencies in significant ways if an agency ofgovernment needs cars or trucks gm ford and chrysler can compete for the contracts should it need paper and it does consume paper in enormous lots georgiapacific weyerhaeuser and international paper can be invited to bid but you do not buy a tank off the shelf or a frigate or a fighter plane or a missile contracting for these items is a far more sophisticated process if the plan proposed by ofpp when finally adopted meets the unique needs of dod there is no reason why we cannot fold in multiyear contracting as proposed in that plan nor does mr harper leave any doubt in the readers mind that 0mb intends to give the department of defense blankcheck authority his letter continues it is ombs intent to maintain oversight of each candidate multiyear program we are concerned with the specific safeguards to be used to comply with the antideficiency act moving along in his statement mr broo s allows that we will be giving the department of defense 1 65

manner as to total that amount it is of course impossible let me remind you that we are not talking about turning over even 52 billion a year to dod we are not talking about half that figure every witness who has been before any comnmittee which has held hearings on this subject has indicated there will be no more than 15 and probably as few as 5 major weapons systems at any one time for which multiyear contracting will be requested and right here i should add that approval of five multiyear contracts each with a 100 million cancellation ceiling does not mean that the government is liable

was begun in march 1981 of the 50 percent who have appealed their terminations 67 percent have been returned to the program through the appeals process every month that we delay another 53 000 cases are reviewed by state agencies and about 22 000 beneficiaries terminated based on current data we can expect about 7 500 of these beneficiaries to be erroneously terminated next month what this means is people with acute chronic and often terminal illness will be taken off the disability rolls with at most 2 months notice many of these people have no income other than money that they receive from the social security administration what happens to these individuals and their families is tragic there are documented cases of people committing suicide after receiving their notices of termination there are cases of people dying during or directly after the medical examinations imposed on them by the continuing disability reviews often this is because they are sent to doctors who are not their own treating physician and have no previous knowledge of their health conditions and the threat these tests may pose to the persons life and then there is the growing body of evidence uncovering people who have died from conditions that the social security administration said they did not have or that were not serious enough to keep them from working i have never been one who believes that we should pass federal legislation based on anecdotal information but the stories that we are hearing conic from every state in the nation and many of these have been clearly substantiated i feel

throuth the adinis tratlive law judge process we do this for three reasons first 67 percent of the appealed terminations have been wrong second there is clearly established legal principle that legitimately awarded benefits should not be taken away without due process and third people who have been erroneously terminated have faced additional devastating hardships such as the loss of their homes the loss of their cars and bankruptcy it is not taking about 11 months from the time one is terminated to the time one actually receives a check after a reversal at the administrative law judge level even for those persons who are reinstated and receive retroactive benefits it is often too late to save their homes for the mortgages have already been foreclosed many will never have another

efficiency and fairness of procedures used by the federal government when the conference determines that government procedures need improvement it submits a recommendation to the president the congress the relevant agencies and when appropriate the judicial conference during the past 18 years many of its recommendations have been adopted either through legislation or through changes in agency procedures the conference works with agencies on a continuing basis to improve and simplify their regulatory enforcement and adjudicatory functions it also renders technical assistance and advice to agencies charged with the implementation of new legislation such as the equal access to justice act and the regulatory flexibility act in addition the conference has statutory mandates such as those in the sunshine act and the magnusonmoss act to monitor agency implementation of statutory programs the conference serves the public by working to attain fairness and balance in the

four new years are authorized the bill as amended by the committee provides an authorization ceiling of 2 3 million for each year through 1986 this amount allows the conference to obtain the appropriations needed to carry out its present statutory mandates this ceiling also provides the necessary flexibility for the conference to seek additional appropriations to carry out new responsibilities if they are imposed by congress examples of new statutory responsibilities imposed in recent years include advisory and evaluation duties under the regulatory flexibility act the

put this country through a roller coaster of high interest rates high inflation and an unstable economic condition the record of congress makes it clear that it will not change its ways unless it is forced to do so thus the time has come to pass a constitutional amendment which requires the congress to put in place a balanced budget the amendment which is most appropriate to this purpose is house joint resolution 350 and its companion senate resolution s j res 58 this amendment would do four basic things it would require that the congress adopt a statement prior to each year reflecting the fact that outlays will not be greater than receipts and insure that actual outlays do not exceed those presented in the statement it would also allow the congress by a threefifths vote of the whole membership of the house to provide for specific outlays which would exceed receipts directed solely to a specific subject this would thus accomplish a balanced budget second it would limit the rate of increase in spending to a rate that does not exceed the increase in national income in the last quarter of the prior year this would keep congress from balancing the budget through simply raising taxes third the congress could waive the provisions of the amendment when a declaration of war was in effect fourth the congress could not require the states to engage in additional activities without compensation equal to the additional costs this section of the amendment is extremely important as it would limit the ability of the congress to pass onto the states the cost of complying with federal

committee on energy and com merce was successful in meeting 93 percent of its 3year savings goal our efforts resulted in a package of medicare and medicaid changes which both slow the growth of these programs and also minimize the effect on the program beneficiaries but to put this effort in its proper context i want to advise the members of this body of the problem our nation faces regarding the skyrocketing costs of health care and remind all of the members assembled here that some of the people who are talking against this portion of the conference report are talking against the very cuts in the growth of rate of spending that they have been advocating for all of the time that they have been members of this body the most obvious aspect of health care spending in 1981 was its rapid and sustained rate in 1981 health care expenditures increased by 15 1 percent this along with the 15 8percent increase in 1980 provide the highest increases in the last 16 years public sources provided 42 7 percent of all of the money spent on health care in 1981 including federal payments of 84 billion and 39 billion in state and local government funds in order to put these increases in a more proper perspective i would like to recount to the members a brief pro gram growth history of just these two entitlement programs over the last 5 years and then the administrations projections through fiscal year 1985 in 1977 federal outlays for medicaid accounted for some 9 7 billion this year 17 2 billion by 1985 24 2 billion for the medicare program 1977 expenditures were 20 8 billion cur rent expenditures for this year are 50 billion rising to 76 billion in 1985 and that would amount to a 266percent increase over an 8year period of time the programmatic changes called for in this conference report amounting to some 14 5 billion in savings over the next 3 years will help in retarding the growth trends that i have described to the members and for this reason alone i would support this package but i want to go beyond these reasons to remind many of the members of this conference on both sides of the aisle that we admitted to ourselves last year when we passed the tax cut bill that we went too far we put too many things in it and at some point we were going to have to address the revenue shortfall that we created last year this bill proposes to do that by enacting the very tax changes that the budget resolution that a majority of this house voted for earlier this year calls for what we are doing here in adopting this conference report if we choose to do that is to merely acknowledge pub licly what we have been acknowledging privately among ourselves that we went too far last year and we have to do something about it and the alternative to doing something about it is to confront the 184 billion deficit being projected by the congressional budget office and the probable 20 percent prime interest rate that would result from that if we want the young people of america to ever be able to afford to buy a home or to even think about a purchase like a new automobile that interest rate problem has to be addressed the adoption of this confer ence report

alexander haig haig suspends grain talks uses chicanery in butter sales to new zealand and just gets hip deep in all of these negotiations with foreign governments on who we are going to sell agricultural products to but the important point is this the president asked for a chance to govern in this country he got that chance and he was elected the question is what is the presidents policy to deal with the agricultural problems in this country the answer to that is the president says through his spokesman that our policy is to plant fence row to fence row and that somehow the free market will take over somehow that will resolve all of our problems and at the time time we havt a secretary of state who interfere with the export markets and a director of the office of management and budget who is crouched off at the side of the chamber in an anteroom and directs the farm debate on that side of the aisle the fact is people who know about farming are not in control in this administration in dealing with farm problems that is the difficulty i want to underscore one point it is not that we do not have enough money to deal with farm problems there is money around here there was money around here when the administration asked this congress to pass a foreign aid bill 30 percent above the previous foreign aid bill this congress says we will pay we will pay there was money when the previous administration asked congress let us bail out chrysler and the people in washington said we will pay and then there was money when poland said we cannot pay our debts to the american banks and to the financial institutions of some 70 million interest the president says we will pay we will pay when it comes to the family farmer and the question of whether that farmer is going to keep that yard light on and keep doing chores when that farmer needs some time and some help to stay alive economically those voices are distant and are refusing to say we will pay we will pay paying does not mean charity it does not mean welfare it does not mean a giveaway it simply means that this country will commit ourselves to the kind of farm program that many countries have provided their farmers why is it that a tremendous import fee is imposed on a bushel of wheat when it hits the japanese shores it is because the japanese want to protect their farmers and have a farm
