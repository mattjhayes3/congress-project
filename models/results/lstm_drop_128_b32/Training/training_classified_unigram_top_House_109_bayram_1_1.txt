cooperation in working to have this amendment be included in the final legislation as it is a sense of congress amendment that i think makes a very important statement the proposal relates to the civil forfeiture provision of 18 unitedstatesc 981 and would add a section that would allow civil plaintiffs to attach judgments to collect compensatory damages for which a terrorist organization has been adjudged liable and from the pool of assets that have been forfeited under section 981 this is distinctive because this pertains to circumstances of terrorism but not necessarily in circumstances when we are at war my amendment seeks to allow victims of terrorism who obtain civil judgments for damages caused in connection with the acts to attach foreign or domestic assets held by the united states government under 18 unitedstatesc section 981 g calls for the forfeiture of all assets foreign or domestic of any individual entity or organization that is engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism as we look at h r 3199 the patriot act it misses the opportunity to in fact allow victims to satisfy judgments that is the key for example the sobero case where the gentleman from riverside california was beheaded by abu sayyaf leaving his children fatherless the administration responded to this incident by sending a thousand special forces officers to track down the perpetrators yet the family of this decreased could not claim any compensation for the tragedy that occurred the same thing occurred with the iran hostages which many of us are familiar with but are my colleagues aware of the situation with our american servicemen who were harmed in the libyansponsored bombing of the la belle disco in germany they were obstructed from being able to enforce judgments that they received against the terroristsponsored attack and the attack that was sponsored by libya in addition a group of american prisoners tortured in iraq during the persian gulf war were barred from collecting their judgment from the iraqi government i do believe in conference we will have the opportunity to vet this and to work with all the parties concerned to finally bring some relief on this issue many members have attempted to bring about relief in special claims for their particular individual constituents in their particular jurisdictions fortunately in the opportunity we have today by including this sense of congress in the patriot act we will finally get both our debate and we will get action i bring attention as well to the world trade center bombing victims who were barred from obtaining judgments against the iraqi government in their claim against the iraqi government the victims were awarded 64 million against iraq in connection with the september 20 2001 attack however they were rebuffed in their efforts to attach the vested iraqi assets while the judgment rendered was sound the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the lower courts finding that the iraqi assets now transferred to the unitedstates treasury were protected by unitedstates sovereign immunity and were unavailable for judicial attachment one major problem that frustrates the objective of my amendment is the fact that information is not publicly available regarding the amount and or kind of civil forfeitures made to date so this amendment will allow the full discussion by a sense of congress of what would be the right process to proceed balancing the needs of the government balancing the needs of the victims of terrorism balancing the question of justice and yes balancing the responsible actions under the patriot act protecting us against terrorism but then when we are victims of terrorism to give us the opportunity for relief i would hope my colleagues would support this amendment so we can carry this forward into conference and be able to provide the kind of leadership necessary for the throngs of victims those who have already suffered and we hope not but for those who may suffer in the future i would say that absent this public disclosure of this very substantial information that is about the assets it is very

the years but despite the promises made to sell them to an increasingly skeptical public they have manifestly failed to open foreign markets for unitedstates producers or even to limit predatory foreign commercial practices such as subsidizing dumping and exchange rate manipulation in fact the trade flows clearly shows that the main new accomplishments of these trade agreements have been to help unitedstates and foreignbrand automakers alike supply the american market from lowwage export platforms like mexico as symbolized by the ludicrously unequal auto tariffs left in place by unitedstates negotiators of china trade deals unitedstates policy on automotive trade with china is speeding down the same road and will likely produce the same results the united states still runs a small trade surplus in autos with china but since 2000 chinese auto eiports to the united states have outpaced the united states vehicle exports to china by a fourtoone ratio the unfair chinese

not clear the language applies to any advanced research and development that is funded by the secretary which may inappropriately extend the exemption far beyond barda to other research funded by the

the gentleman my friend from florida andthe rules committee mr puipnam the chairman of our policy committee here in the house republican conference i rise today in strong support of the rule for this budget resolution which strikes a delicate balance between fully funding our priorities and exercising restraint of spending already we have ileard the debate and the dialogue here i have known this a long time every member of congress understands this needs outpace resources it has always been that way that is why we have a budget committee that is why we have mr putnam here on the floor today aiid other members who are going to say golly we could spend as much money as we really wanted if we could come to some resolution of how much was enough but the fact of the matter is that the insatiable appetites that continue to be fed in this house and in this government for more and more and more spending will not be ever satisfied so we have to strike that balance we know that we have had devastating challenges that have faced this country terrorists attacks of 9 11 hurricanes katrina and rita and yet our economy has demonstrated strength and resiliency it is republicans who come to the floor of the house of representatives in the majority and every year defend what we do and i want to tell you that i am proud of what we did last year for this year and what we are doing proudly to make sure next year will work properly we are doing this year this last year our economy grew at an impressive rate of 3 5 percent the greatest most vibrant economy that is in the world that we know today from a g8 country this was no accident but it came as the direct result of congresss planning planning for growth and tax relief planning for giving americans more of their own money and planning to make sure that we had investment that was made here in america since comprehensive tax relief was passed in 2003 5 million new jobs have been created at just 4 8 percent the unemployment rate remains at the historically low figure below the averages of the 1970s the 1980s and the 1990s this rapid economic growth has also generated rapid federal tax growth we are progrowth republicans we do not want to run a deficit but we must make sure that we look at both sides of the equation that is growing the economy as well as being careful by what we spend treasury figures show our booming tax receipts grew by 14 5 percent in 2005 the fastest pace in 25 years however on the flip side since 2001 our government has expanded in spending by 45 percent we are saying with last years budget this spending spree has got to end and that is what we did last year for this year and what we are going to do this year for next year jim nussle the chairman of the budget committee has led this house to an important conclusion and that is what mr putnam is here selling to the members today and that is we are not about politics in this budget it is about structure it is about saying how much money we are going to make available and then we are going to let other important committees our appropriators be able to understand where the present needs are and then we are going to give them the authority to go and spend the money based on priorities this is the right way to run the railroad this is the right way to do things but we must have the responsibility by passing a responsible bill or this house will fall to the whims of every single person who wants their own special project to be passed spending will be out of control so i urge my colleagues to recognize and understand that the process that the budget committee has been going through has been very important and it has produced a winner it has produced the ability that we have in a framework to put the needs and priorities into balance for this united states congress i am proud of what we have done i am prbud of what mr putnam supports today i urge my colleagues to support this rule affd the

of the comprehensive iran legislation the iran freedom support act the focus of the congress continues to be that articulated through the iran freedom support act which is to address the totality of

the funding in this bill for research and university resource centers is 9 448 000 below last years levels and those are the very centers that are researching and developing hydrogen and hybrid and other advanced transportation technologies now we all understand how vital that research and development is the president bf the united states on this floor during the state of the union proclaimed that we must reduce our addiction to foreign oil anyone in their cars at a gas station today as we are on the floor paying over 3 a gallon for gas understands how important it is that we reduce that addiction to foreign oil i am a member of the armed services committee our military understands how critical that is last year the department of defense spent 10 billion on basic energy costs of that 4 7 billion was spent to buy one thing fuel for air force planes i was in iraq last month and was on a wonderful stryker combat vehicle it gets about 10 miles to the gallon it is dangerous when we have to borrow money from china to fund defense budgets to buy oil from unstable persian gulf countries to fuel our militaryto protect us from china and unstable persian gulf countries we have all talked about having men on the moon research and development programs to end that dangerous dependence on foreign oil we have talked about having new apollo programs to research and develop new vehicles not lunar landing modules that will put people on the moon but hydrogen and hybrid vehicles that will make it easier and safer and less expensive for people to drive on our roads here on earth and yet this bill cuts 9 5 million from the very research centers that are engaged in deploying those vehicles th is is not a giant leap for mankind this is not even one small step for mankind it is a step backwards and so my amendment does not go above last years level it does not take a giant leap that i think we need all it does is it keeps us steady so we do not continue to lose ground to the very adversaries we have around the world who are willing to use oil as a weapon against us and use oil to blackmail us and compromise our capabilities this amendment simply offsets salaries in

in my judgment that mr poe secures more money for the 287 g program i think that is an essential matter that needs to be taken care of to get state and local law enforcement assistance in the enforcement of the immigration laws we will never be able to get enough border control to completely handle the problem in my judgment unless we get the active assistance of state and local law enforcement as authorized and funded in the bill we provided 5 4 million for training of local law enforcement officers in participation in 287 g and the presidents border supplemental proposes a 50 million increase so we are going to get that money that mr poe would like for us to have we are just going to get it ffom another source i agree with the gentleman from north carolina on the need to keep the mopey in the chief information officers account for the data center and it will assist those data centers will assist the border effort to be sure that we keep out people that should not be in the country we cannot do it without a coordinated data collection center and that is what this bill includes 41 billion for currently the department has 17 of these centers scattered all over the country largely a legacy of consolidating multiple agencies when we formed the department running those multiple data floors is expensive it hinders information sharing it creates security vulnerabilities the department estimates that consolidation to twin facilities as the bill proposes will save 50 million each year starting in 2009 with two mirror sites the current information silos scattered across the department will be done away with allowing a consolidated view of information a critical element of information sharing having information at twin sites allows it to be under one security umbrella leaving fewer opportunities to compromise secure information the first center is being built in stennis mississippi the department plans to release a request for information to begin the competitive process to locate a surface for a second mirror facility this year without a redundant data center should something happen to this stennis facility dhs would not be able to operate people could not cross the border travelers would stop at airports coast guard data would be lost so i urge the members to reject this amendment so that we can have the data centers that are absolutely vital to the successful operation of the department and the battle to keep illegals out of the country i would point out again to mr poe that when the presidents border supplemental passes

despite all their threats of people who were going to get killed and places that were going to be bombed and indeed 48 people were killed despite all that voters turned out of course in record numbers because the election itself was a record one voter said on sunday that each vote was a bullet in the heart of the enemy we are defeating the terrorists in coming here he said proudly as he dipped his finger in the famous purple ink this was done in over 30 000 polling places and now the votes are being counted when we look at the turnout nearly 60 percent we are not really sure what the turnout officially is but compare that to the united states presidential election just this november of a 60 7 percent voter turnout yet no one was threatened to be killed that was the highest turnout in the united states of america in 38 years indeed in my home county in savannah georgia chatham county had a turnout of a mere 48 percent 2 years ago when we elected the governor of georgia so for them under these circumstances to have a 60 percent voter turnout it is phenomenal but it is also a huge statement on how badly people want freedom how badly they want to throw off the shackles of

for this house bill 280 the brownfields redevelopment enhancement act because it will make a real difference for communities throughout this country i was a pennsylvania senator for 10 years and while i was there we passed a very forwardthinking brownfields bill that helped to provide more opportunity for development of brownfields without fear of liability that is one step and it was important for

for americas small cities and communities so that they can thrive my district is home to many of these communities that have small brownfields sites right in the middle of town revitalizing these sites is key to helping rebuild the economy of these small towns the significance of this development was highlighted recently at the unitedstates conference of mayors in june 2003 when they did their survey the cities that were surveyed noted that the creation of over 83 000 jobs through redevelopment in 148 cities was because of brownfields redevelopment however they also stated that nearly 600 000 more jobs could be created with more liberal use of monies through this program in addition by helping to reclaim these old sites developers do not have to look to undeveloped land to locate businesses or residential properties one of the major hurdles to revitalizing these is financing unfortunately this is especially true for these small towns and cities that i mentioned these are the ones that are most eager to see these sites as host to new development they face continuous hurdles and this bill will help remove some of these hurdles these grants through bedi could be a valuable source of funding to revitalize these towns and communities and lead to a brighter future that these towns envision the program requires communities at this time though to take on additional debt many of these communities cannot afford to do so the investment though in these communities would provide opportunities for them to grow and to grow their tax base and also add jobs i have heard from many in the communities i represent that we need to work to make bedi grants more available this bill would do so by delinking section 108 loans from bedi grants h r 280 will provide this access to
