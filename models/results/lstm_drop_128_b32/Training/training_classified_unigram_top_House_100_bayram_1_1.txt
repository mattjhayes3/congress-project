its cost of paying priceanderson insurance premiums to ratepayers in the past to whom did a utility turn to pay its allegedly higher federal income tax bills ratepayers today to whom are utilities looking to pay for the exorbitant cost of new plants or even those that have been abandoned ratepayers and in the future to whom are utilities going to turn to pay their priceanderson premiums if a nuclear accident occurs ratepayers well now its time for congress to tell utilities you have picked the pockets of ratepayers long enough its time you who run the utility companies management and shareholders really felt the financial consequences of your decisions my amendment protects the interests of ratepayers in a simple straightforward way it encourages a regulatory commission to balance the financial ability of a utility to pay these premiums against the ability of its ratepayers to pay this expense it simply states that if a utilitys net income increases by 10 percent or more during the 2year period prior to its payment of a deferred premium and ending in the year immediately preceding such payment then a commission would have the discretion to decide whether to exclude some or all of a utilitys premiums from rates the need for this amendment is clear because it is uncertain that regulatory commissions have this discretion one fact however is certain ratepayers are facing higher and higher electric bills between 1981 and 1986 the average residential utility bill rose nearly 200 annually within the last year ratepayers in arkansas pennsyl vania kansas and montana have been shocked to see their electric bills rise anywhere from 10 to 20 percent if ratepayers are left holding the bag for these premium payments this will grossly aggravate their financial predicament in my state of illinois and in states like connecticut california pennsylvania ohio washington arizona texas nebraska minnesota arkansas louisiana mississippi alabama florida georgia south carolina north carolina tennessee virginia maryland new jersey new york massachusetts indiana michigan and wisconsinall of which have more than one nuclear generating plantratepayers will owe a considerable sum for example chicagos utility commonwealth edison owns or shares in the ownership of 12 nuclear facilities therefore chicago ratepayers could be potentially liable for nearly 760 million in premium payments or over 10 percent of the total compensation pool provided by this act clearly this is an unconscionably disproportionate share that will have to be borne by chicagos already overburdened ratepayers i believe this is grossly inequitable because ratepayers had no say whatsoever in their utilitys decision to construct a particular type of generating plant such decisions were made by the utilitys management with the concurrence of its shareholders who ought to at least help bear the cost now some will argue that utility management teams made this decision because nuclear power promised ratepayersa host of benefits but these promises have proven to be largely illusory nuclear powerplants have been plagued by cost overruns the con struction of many have been delayed considerably if they have been built at all yet in each of these circumstances utilities insist that ratepayers pay for these abandoned or nonfunctioning plants which wont generate a single kilowatt of electricity now they are asking ratepayers to pick up the tab if one of those that is operating has an accident i say again enough is enough given the industrys current financial position a sharing of the payment of priceanderson premiums will not work a hardship on companies overall the utility industry posted a healthy 12percent gain in net income in 1986a substantial improvement over the 15percent drop they suffered in 1985 the financial health of this industry is so good that utilities are diversifying into a number of nonutility ventures ranging from investments in aircraft leasing equipment to running banks to operating the nations largest drugstore chain in fact diversification has become such a hot idea in the industry that one utility analyst predicts more utilities will participate once they generate the needed cash therefore there is absolutely no reason why this excess cash could not be used to pay some if not all of a utilitys priceanderson premiums this amendment will cause little if any diminution in the attractiveness of utility stocks on the contrary standard and poors current analysis of the electric utility says benefiting from improved cash flow investors can expect higher dividends for the balance of this decade indeed shareholders are reaping these financial gains from the financial hardships that are being imposed on senior citizens the poor and those on fixed incomes again there is no reason why shareholders cannot share in the payment of these premiums if it only means a small reduction in the higher dividends they will be receiving finally in addition to balancing the financial interests of ratepayers and shareholders this amendment will promote greater safety and accountability in the nuclear industry if utilities know their shareholders could be liable for paying priceanderson they are likely to keep a closer watch over contractors to ensure plants are built properly and over employees to make sure facilities are operated correctly i offered this amendment in committee and it was defeated because my distinguished colleague the chairman of the energy and power subcommittee mr sharp said utility commissions already have the discretion to do what my amendment asks them to do for too long illinois ratepayers and ratepayers throughout this nation heard the hollow words of their regulatory commissions that they would protect them from exorbitant utility bills but bills continued to go up until state legislatures and consumer groups put commissioners on notice that they werent going to tolerate the routine passthrough of utility expenses and now thank goodness the illinois commerce commission like many state commissions is carefully scrutinizing a utilitys expenses before they are charged to ratepayers i think the same situation applies here the mere suggestion that utility commissions have the discretion to apportion these costs is not enough congress has to put regulators on notice that ratepayers have paid enough and it is time utilities shared in the financial burden of their decisions indeed that is exactly the intent of my amendment it sets but in positive law that under certain financial circumstances commissions shall balance the interests of ratepayers and utility shareholders and make sure neither pays a disproportionate share of the costs associated with priceanderson i

impairments such as cerebral palsy and epilepsy or developmental disabilities attributable to a combination of mental and physical impairments are not reached by the advocacy and planning of the state councils which administer this program the bill before us would require each state to develop a process to identify those individuals and report to congress on ways of fully serving the

authority which will subsist between the two houses in all legislative subjects except the originating of money bills it cannot be doubted that the house composed of the greater number of members when supported by the more powerful states and speaking the known and determined sense of a majority of the people will have no small advantage in a question depending on the comparative firmness of tile two houses in other words in a conflict between the house and the senate it was the belief of the founding fathers that quite consistently it was the house which will be dominant now why is that important it is important because when you look at a house of representatives which increasingly distances itself from the public which insures the election of its own members by taking taxpayers money and allowing them to spend on staffs on offices and on direct mail that insures that virtually no incumbent will be defeated that that house grabs into its 435 hands of its elected members the thousands of hands of its professional staff an ability to dominate and bully the executive branch which is not yet recognized but which is central to understanding how the country can vote for a conservative president and yet get a consistently liberal government in washington dc this tendency of the legislative branch to dominate is made even more powerful if i might quote again from the federalist papers of hamilton in no 22 on page 148 by the fact that if you then centralize power into a few hands into the speaker the chairman of the rules committee the chairman of the appropriations committee then you have extraordinary power hamilton warned the public business must in some way or other go forward if a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority respecting the best mode of conducting it the majority in order that something may be done must conform to the views of the minority and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater and give a tone to the national proceedings hence tedious delays continual negotiation and intrigue contemptible compromises of the public good and yet in such a system it is even happy when such compromises can take place for upon some occasions things will not admit of accommodation and then the measures of government must be injuriously suspended or fatally defeated it is often by the impracticability of obtaining the concurrence of the necessary number of votes kept in a state of inaction its situation must always savor of weakness sometimes border upon anarchy it is not difficult to discover that a principie of this kind gives greater scope to foreign corruption as well as to domestic faction than that which permits the sense of the majority to decide though the contrary of this has been presumed the mistake has proceeded from not attending with due care to the mischiefs that may be occasioned by obstructing the progress of government at certain critical seasons when the concurrence of a large number is required by tile constitution to the doing of any national act we are apt to rest satisfied that all is safe because nothing improper will be likely io be done but we forget how much good may be prevented and how much ill may be produced by the power of hindering that which is necessary from being done and of keeping affairs in the same unfavorable posture in which they may happen to stand at particular periods the point which hamilton is making is that when a handful of members can block the government and i would suggest continuing resolutions are probably the best example of this when the chairman of the committee on appropriations and three or four of his senior staff when the speaker and the chairman of the committee on rules when three or four or five members can sit in a room and say no the government will not continue unless we get what we want then hamilton was warning that great damage could be done let me suggest to my colleagues that if they examine the various and sundry weaknesses of the continuing resolution that we passed in december and look at all the little things that were discovered after that 1 300page bill was passed they would begin to understand why in fact hamilton warned against allowing power to be centralized if my colleagues look secondly at the parallel growth of a cheerful secret negotiation process by which foreign governments are often talked with in secret by members of the house leadership you will appreciate better why hamilton warned about the dangers of foreign corruption a theme which occurs again and again in the federalist papers because the founding fathers had experienced it and were aware of it that is why anyone who is concerned about one party having a monopoly of power for 34 years anyone concerned about the way in which power has been centralized in recent years about the way in which there are more and more secrets and more and more secret legislation can appreciate the dangers in the article in congressional quarterly for example of may 23 1987 entitled few complaints are voiced as doors close on capitol hill which says many subcommittees of the iouse appropriations committee likewise meet in private to draft each years spending bills the article which i will not go into in detail but is worth every member reading talks about the fact first that more and more powerful decisions by powerful committees are being made in closeddoor meetings that those meetings are closed deliberately to keep the lobbyists and citizens from knowing what is going on the article is in fact so candid in quoting some members who i do not want to quote by name without their being present as admitting the purpose of closeddoor meetings is to hide and to then go out in public and pretend they did something that they did not do that in effect misinforming and deceiving the lobbyists is a major function of closeddoor meetings i would suggest that almost every citizen should read the article from congressional quarterly and a parallel article from the washington times of july 6 1987 entitled some find best legislation is written in closeddoor sessions both of these articles suggest that we are now in a situation in which legislation is best written in secret so that the public the lobbyists the people who care about it dont know what is happening or who did it for those people who are this week filling out their tax bills and wonder how it could have been such a mess let me suggest that the committee on ways and means decision to close its doors and to write it in secret was not possibly as helpful as it could have been that the fact that the tax bill was largely written behind closed doors is part of the problem as the article says the tax bill went through the ways and means the finance committee and conference in closed sessions this was the most important tax bill of modern times and it was written in secret most tax bills are written in secret i would suggest that that is part of the danger of having secret appropriations secret tax bills which come to the floor as a huge package and we are told to vote yes or no we just do not have time to read it in the case of the appropriations bill which spent 700 billion the house had 3 hours there is a second problem which is alluded to in the congressional quarterly article and that is that capitol hill reporters tend to become captives of the system there is a stockholm syndrome we learn in studying terrorists in which the kidnaped begin to like the terrorist after a while they identify with the people who control their lives let me suggest that is a very real problem on capitol hill the article in congressional quarterly on secret meetings had a section entitled few objections from press reporters rarely object to closeddoor committee meetings the article says that surprises chiles who served in the florida legislature where reporters used to have to be forced from a room it goes on to say they could care less of capitol hill reporters a lot of them just work through their sources and feel like open meetings just open it up so everybody has the same shot at the information the concept of sources is very important and is the opposite of the way the white house works the white house press corps thrives and becomes famous by baiting the president the capitol hill press corps thrives and becomes far less famous by not baiting those who would frankly use their power to close them out the result is there is far less investigative reporting on capitol hill far less aggressive effort on capitol hill and the reporters are far more intimidated by those who would punish them by cutting off their sources if they were to raise too much complaint third the national opponents might be the executive branch the executive branch has seen its turf stepped upon it has seen the congress increasingly push it around and yet the founding fathers warned that anytime there was adequate control in the legislative branch it would be stronger than the executive branch the founding fathers were quite clear in their own minds that we would end up in a situation in which the house would dominate and in which the legislative branch would be far stronger and much more capable of doing what it wanted than would the executive branch let me cite in particular two essays by hamilton and hamilton in no 73 at page 442 said the propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights and to absorb the powers of the other departments has been already more than once suggested the insufficiency of a mere parchment delineation of the boundaries of each has also been remarked upon fand the necessity of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its own defense has been inferred and proved from these clear and indubitable principles results the propriety of a negative either absolute or qualified in the executive upon the acts of the legislative branches without the one or the other the former would be absolutely unable to defend himself against the depredations of the latter le might gradually be stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions or annihilated by a single vote and in the one mode or the other the legislative and executive powers might speedily conic to be blended in the same hands let me quote one sentence which every reagan appointee and every conservative columnist and reporter in america and every conservative politician should read from page 442 he might gradually be stripped of his authorities by successive resolutions is that not precisely the boland amendment process in foreign affairs is it not the steady encroachment of the legislative branch and the house in particular on foreign policy precisely what hamilton warned against and is it not exactly what the reagan administration has tolerated why did it tolerate it it tolerated it because on balance the legislative branch when controlled by the same party for 34 years is more powerful because the legislators have the power to punish the fbi they have the power to punish the cia they have the power to punish again and again petty punishments such as the dia loses two airplanes because we are told it will not fly the girl friend of a congressman on the airplane so the appropriations subcommittee takes out two airplanes to punish them we are told again and again in casebycase linebyline examples that the secretary of defense the head of the central intelligence agency the head of the federal bureau of investigation the secretary of the treasury can lose resources can lose control over their department if the legislative branch dominated in the house for 34 years by the democrats wants to is this something mythical let me read from hamiltons 71 page 433 the tendency of the legislative authority to absorb every other has been fully displayed and illustrated by examples in some preceding numbers in governments purely republican this tendency is almost irrestible the representatives of the people in a popular assembly seem sometimes to fane that they are the people themselves and betray strong symptoms of impatience and disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter as if the exercise of its rights by either the executive or judiciary h 1 120 were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity they often appear disposed to exert an imperious control over the other departments and as they commonly have the people on their side they always act with such momentum as to make it very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the balance of the constitution did not alexander hamilton in this paragraph clearly tell us in 1988 what we are living through in america that an imperial congress with an imperial speaker passes imperial legislation and takes from the executive branch powers which under the constitution belong to the president and gets involved in foreign policy in ways which are destructive of the nation so by allowing the reform of vietnam and watergate only to focus on the executive branch by having a house of representatives which has taken power away from the people by guaranteeing its own reelection and which has taken power away from the executive branch by passing hundreds of resolutions hundreds of amendments by passing appropriations bills written in small groups in secret meetings it is in fact precisely the centering of power on capitol hill which the founding fathers warned against and which in particular they were concerned would have a devastating effect let me quote again from the founding fathers in the case james madison no 48 page 310 and 311 who quotes thomas jefferson and what thomas jefferson is warning about this is a quote from the notes on the state of virginia what jefferson is warning about in this quote is precisely what the legislative branch arrogates to itself power over time and the legislative comes to dominate the executive branch all the powers of goernment legislative executive and judiciary result to the legislative body the concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic government it will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands and not by a single one one hundred and seventythree despots would surely be as oppressive as one let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic of venice as little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves an elective despotism was not the government we fought for but one which should not only be founded on free principles but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limits without being effectually checked and restrained by the others for this reason that convention which passed the ordinance of government laid its foundation on this basis that the legislative executive and judiciary departments should be separate and distinct so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time but no barrier was provided between these several powers the judiciary and the executive members were left dependent on the legislative for their subsistance in office and some of them for their continuance in it if therefore the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers no opposition is likely to be made nor if made can be effectual because in that case they may put their proceedings into the form of acts of assembly which will render them obligatory on the other branches they have accordingly in many instances decided rights which should have been left to judiciary controversy and the direction of the executive during the whole time of their session is becoming habitual and familiar that is thomas jefferson writing in the notes on the state of virginia quoted by james madison in the federalist papers what does it refer to it refers precisely to the continuing resolution in december of 1987 of trying to kill two newspapers in boston and new york in order to punish rupert murdoch because he doesnt like some liberal democrats putting that amendment in at 3 oclock in the morning in a subcommittee meeting which no one knew about when we passed it on the floor and no one knew about it when the president signed it is precisely what thomas jefferson meant when he talked about an elective despotism what right has the congress to punish a man and take away his newspapers simply because the congress does not like it i will come back in a minute to the way in which despots as they grow used to having their power as they protect themselves from the public try to censor the press until the most recent and shocking example in this house of a deliberate effort to censor the press the executive branch is afraid the executive branch is unwilling to enage the legislature the executive branch backs off the truth is the reagan administration has been consistently reluctant to take on the encroachments on its power and to take on the encroachments by the power of the legislature which would have enraged john f kennedy lyndon johnson and would have outraged harry truman and franklin roosevelt the timidity of the executive branch has allowed the house to dominate in ways which have been destructive to the united states there is a fourth factor and that is the left simply fights harder and attacks harder this was captured i think by norman podnoretz a man who was once to the left who has recognized that if america is to survive we need to have a firm anticommunist policy he wrote a column the antibork campaign its total war he says as follows there is something to be learned from the debate over robert bork but it has little to do with the supreme court or the constitution or even with bork himself on each of these subjects the debate has created more confusion not less on the other hand two crucial truths about the current political situation in america have been given a kind of highresolution clarity they did not possess before the first is that a war is going on in this country the second is that until a few days ago only one sidethe side opposing borkseemed to know it podnoretz goes on to say why did it take so long for the conservatives to recognize the true nature of the struggle they were in surprising as it may seem the main reason was sheer naivete he goes on to say the conservatives knew of course that the snecial interests would set up this and kn that the left wing of the democratic parly would go all out against bork but they could not believe that anyone else would wish to line up against so brilliantly a qualified and so morally a spotless nominee and in particular they did not anticipate that so many lawyers and law professors would find rationalizations for denying a seat on the supreme court to one of their own intellectual stars indeed for all the endless complaining by conservatives about liberal domination of the media and the universities including the law schools they did not fully realize just how far this process of politicization has gone and they could not take it in that literal opinion still regards their ideas not as respectable points of view to be debated but as an evil to be wiped out he concludes with this for now conservatives will have to figure out new ways of responding to the lesson of the bork nomination which is that the war against them and their ideas has heated up again and that it is being conducted as nothing less than a war to the death let me suggest that the ferocity and the savagery of the left whether it is smearing judge bork or whether it is smearing the executive branch and ignoring the house that has the passion on the left and that willingness to fight all out which has been a major factor in focusing on the executive branch because it is in the executive branch in the election of the president that the american people have spoken so clearly and in the election of the president for 20 years while the left has increasingly dominated the house the left has lost nationally in 1968 only 43 percent of the american people voted for the leftwing candidate in 1972 only 38 percent voted for the leftwing candidate and in 1976 there was no leftwing candidate because jimmy carter had defeated the left in the democratic party running as a centrist in 1980 only 41 percent of the american people voted for the leftwing candidate in 1984 only 41 percent of the american people voted for the leftwing candidate for over 20 years the left has been defeated in attempting to control the executive branch but it has increasingly controlled the legislative branch and it has assured its own control in 1975 and after bypassing a series of laws that gave incumbents so much money and so much power that they are virtually impossible to defeat the left controls the house and ignores whatever ethics problems exist in the house the left controls the house and ignores whatever encroachment of power and the left controls the house and ignores the secrecy in foreign policy in the house but savages the executive branch at every occasion in this house attacks and indeed smears those who accept appointment in the executive branch finally the fifth problem is the house republican party as an institution is torn by the legitimate schizophrenia is it the job of the republican party to cooperate with the majority and to pass whatever legislation or whatever and how can it be open and candid about the problems of ethics problems of election laws the problems of secrecy is it the job of the republican party to go into the secret meetings to help write laws to strengthen the hand of the left in the legislature to become part of the law of the land or is it the job of the republican party to get the best deal for the white house and serve as the legislative agent for the white house or finally is it the job of the house republican party to represent that majority of center left center right sentiment which has repudiated the left do the 60 percent of the american people the 49 states that voted against the left in the presidency deserve active vigorous support in the congress do they deserve an institutional commitment to honesty in the house do they deserve an institutional commitment to election reform to reforming secrecy in the appropriations committee and the ways and means committee do they deserve a commitment to speaking for the mllions of americans who want nonleftwing values to have power in the legislature this division legitimate division legitimate confusion has made it impos sible for the house republican party to be effective in exposing and pursuing the problems of power when held by one side and yet those problems of power are enormous and they are growing worse the longer the democratic party controls the house the further out of touch it gets with the american people the more used it gets to being in power remember what the federalist papers warned that people who are elected to power come to think that they are the power itself the people who have been elected by the people come to believe that they are the people and as a result the arrogance of power grows year by year and now we have 34 years of that growth and if you look at that continuing resolution in december i would suggest that there is not a member of this house who could with a straight face defend all of the various amendments which were snuck in late at night and which displayed legislative power over the executive in real terms cutting out funds for the coast guard 100 million which was not cut out by ronald reagan it was cut out by the house of representatives they cut out two airplanes for the defense intelligence agency to punish it for not flying the girl friend of a member of congress and putting in 8 million for a religious school in france on behalf of a man who happened to be a contributor to a member who voted that in and again specific actions which could never have been defended would never have passed on the floor but could be written in secret and secrecy as dangerous it is dangerous because as the founding fathers warned in the long run it exposes us to corruption and secrecy is particularly dangerous when it involves foreign powers the federalist papers again on page 412 to 413 hamilton no 68 nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal intrigue and corruption these most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils now think about that the founding fathers were frightened indeed if you read the federalist papers they are almost terrified that foreign governments will bribe and corrupt members of the government they are in particular frightened that foreign powers will have undue influence on members of the legislature let me suggest that there are grave temptations involved in having secret meetings with foreign powers secret meetings with foreign dictators that a man who has power in the american government should not meet in secret with a communist dictator or without letting the american government know what happened in that meeting that power can become personal again hamilton no 75 page 451 but a man raised from the station of a private citizen to the rank of chief magistrate possessed of but a moderate or slender fortune and looking forward to a period not very remote when he may probably be obliged to return to tie station from which he was taken might sometimes be under temptations to sacrifice his duty to his interest which it would require superlative virtue to withstand an avaricious man might be tempted to betray the interests of the state to the acquisition of wealth an ambitious man might make his own aggrandizement by the aid of a foreign power the price of his treachery to his constituents the history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world to the sole disposal of a magistrate created and circumstanced what is he saying he is saying that no man neither the president nor the speaker no man should have the power in secret to deal in foreign powers to deal in a way which no one else knows about and now notice again the lesson of watergate the lesson of vietnam which has been applied to the executive branch the president can no longer have a covert operation without telling the congress but covert communications between communist dictators and the congress that is different powerful congressmen today believe they have the right to speak in secret with communist dictators and then to decide legislative questions in a way which may well have been influenced by that conversation and not to report it to the unitedstates government let me suggest that the founding fathers the lessons if you will of this period all relate to this danger that corruption comes from power power unchecked is always dangerous that humans always have vulnerabilities and that there is a danger of foreign powers deliberately corrupting the government of the united states hamilton understood it madison understood it jay understood it let me suggest that the continuing resolution of december 1987 and the recent efforts to kill a newspaper in boston and a newspaper in new york and the more recent example of an effort to censor a magazine all are examples that we need to be aware and concerned let me close then by showing our one example of the radical difference between the rules we now apply to the executive branch good rules rules of reform rules of openness rules of stopping secrecy rules which i believe in and i think on balance that made america healthier and the way in which the game is played in the legislative branch where the spirit of lyndon johnson lives on imagine as a theory that the president of the united states has sent his chief of staff and a private attorney who was a powerful lobbyist to new york city to tell a magazine that it must censor a critical article or the president would file suit page 1 of every newspaper lead on the evening news president attempts to censor magazine no one would stand for it we all know that is ridiculous when john f kennedy canceled the herald tribune it was a major issue that he had canceled the subscription but the idea that the president could attempt to blackmail a newspaper into not publishing something or blackmail a magazine by threatening a libel suit would be inconceivable yet last week the wall street journal and the washington post reported that the speaker of the house had apparently sent a famous lobbyist attorney and the chief of staff of the speaker to new york city there are a series of questions that must be answered about a remarkable effort to censor a national magazine the bankers monthly first when the speakers chief of staff went to new york was he on business paid for by the house if yes does this mean that members of the house can send their lawyer around the country and censor a magazine that s about to print an article which is critical of them there are conflicting accounts of what apparently happened in the effort to censor the magazine the washington post reports that the author of the article william m adler said in a telephone interview that strauss had initially threatened to sue the magazine for libel if it published the second installment strauss could not be reached for comment but lynam disputed that account mr strauss did not go up to threaten them lynam said he went up there to point out factual errors and to get them to take postive steps to remedy it however the wall street journal quotes mr strauss i told them they shouldnt run the thing i told them we might well sue the letter from the publishers attorney clearly saw mr strauss in a lawyerclient relationship with the speaker according to the wall street journal after the meeting mr cross yanked the article from the april magazine which required him to dihcard some pages already printed and to substitute another article his attorney sent mr strauss a letter saying this entailed considerable expense but was being done to afford your client an opportunity to have his response to the article published at the same time is the speakers chief of staff claim that there was no threat factual or are mr adler and mr strauss accurate in saying there was a threat to sue what exactly did the speakers two agents do in new york to get a magazine to go to considerable expense and apparently to tear up already printed pages as the wall street journal reported this house and the country deserve a clear accurate statement of what really happened third mr strauss apparently went to new york as an attorney for a client while in new york he threatened a lawsuit by his own account in the wall street journal if the magazine published the article did the house pay for his trip if not did he in effect make a gift to the speaker of his trip and professional services does that constitute the acceptance of the gift in excess of the 100 limit is it appropriate and ethical for a major lobbyist to give a gift of travel and legal services to a member of congress let alone the speaker of the house fourth according to the washington post the speakers chief of staff said a decision was made to intervene with bankers monthly after the first installment came to his attention who made the decision to intervene who decided to draw mr strauss into the effort to censor bankers monthly was it presented to mr strauss as an official act of the speakers office fifth according to the wall street journal mr strauss said he had not decided whether he would charge mr wright a fee ie said he would have to consider whether house rules permitted him to give free legal help and whether he was acting as a lawyer or as a friend and adviser can an act be changed retroactively to fit the rules did not the phone calls and the letter setting up the meeting indicate clearly that mr strauss and mr lynam were actually conducting business or they were not finally should not all the correspondence relating to this trip and this effort to censor bankers monthly be released so house members can determine which rules apply let me make clear why i am raising these issues we have seen an effort in this country in the last couple of months to kill two newspapers by members of the congress now this is an act of deliberate vengence against rupert murdoch and the boston herald and the new york post on the part of left wing democrats who did not like their editorial policy we are seeing now a press person paid by the speakers office who according to newspaper reports has been writing threatening letters to various magazines and newspapers we now have the example according to two major national newspapers of the chief of staff of the speaker of the house and a famous attorneylobbyist flying to new york to threaten to sue a magazine unless it censored itself now how far do we have to go in having a iouse of representatives in which you cannot defeat the incumbent because federally taxpaid moneys pays for their reelection you cannot hold them accountable because they meet in secret you cannot count on the executive branch because it is increasingly frightened of the sheer power of the left on the appropriations committee and the other committees and now you have an example of the second most powerful elected figure in the united states the speaker of the house the man who is third in line to be president sending off his chief of staff and an amour lobbyinstattorney to censor and browbeat and threaten to sue a magazine because they are printing an article critical of him every member of this house bears equal responsibility if we permit the speaker and his staff to bully and censor magazines and newspapers every reporter on this hill has an obligation to their profession to engage directly and actively in ensuring that the country understands what is going on there is something i think explicitly totally wrong about this procedure i think the speaker owes all of us an explanation i think that these questions require an answer and i think that the fact that the country is not outraged yet is one more sign of the gap between the rules we now apply to the white house and the failure to reform capitol hill the difference between what we expect in terms of the executive branch and what we tolerate in terms of the legislative branch and i think it is time for our generation to apply the same standards of honesty the same standards of fair elections the same standards of accountability the same standards of openness to the congress that we now apply to the white house i yield to the gentleman from texas"], [0.5646325945854187, 0.5646325945854187, 0, "mr president i rise in opposition to this rule and i hope the house

9 billion is in new taxes a little better than 51 percent in 1989 the deficit reductions total some 21 8 billion and new taxes of 14 1 billion almost twothirds of this total if the reconciliation

established the caribbean basin initiative it was the hope that we could put jobs and investment into the caribbean area one of the things that was supposed to be undertaken down there was the

are not able to buy sugar abroad the way use used to do now the hard thing for the people in the caribbean to do is to get the sugar properties so that they can plan them long term so that they could met the ultimate domestic content local content rule that is in our trade bill at the moment they cannot do that because the sugar acreages are committed to other purposes for the long term they can acquire those properties and will be able to meet a higher level of local content in the meantime the threat that the gentleman from illinois speaks of is not a powerhouse in 1985 imports were 12 4 million gallons against unitedstates production of 625 million that is 2 percent in 1986 imports doubled and they became 3 percent in 1987 imports were up to 29 million gallons that is 3 percent of the 850 million that we produced here our government tells us that we have got a i billion gallon market in this country we have not ever been able to fill that amount and so those people who want to protect this dying industry are trying to protect it from nothing it cannot produce what we need to produce to create the market for ethanol if those people really want the market they ought to get some of the imported stuff in here so that we cali create the market that they can fill with their later production i note that the archer daniels co which is pretty much the whole show in the united states with respect to ethanol has already stopped shipping to western states california washington and even colorado that means that we do not have the product we need this prodoct from the caribbean in addition we have made a pledge to the caribbean that we are going to help them lift themselves by their own bootstraps this is only one tiny little portion of the caribbean basin initiative it is

the national security of our country if we accept tile michel motion to recommit we are going to snuff that out and we are going to dry up ethanol supplies even under the provision in this bill that grandfather is only extended for six companies for 1 years we expect to have a full report after the year and a half that is provided for the trade bill then we will have a better idea of what is the effect on the local corn producers in the united states what is the need for local content within the caribbean i believe on the basis of that report we will be able to legislate in a way that is equitable both to unitedstates producers and to our needs and intentions in the caribbean but for now i would urge the rejection of the michel motion it is important to the caribbean basin i think it

lots of aid the united states gave them 100 000 tons of wheat we offered to give them peace corps volunteers did they say yes to the peace corps they said no they wanted cuban teachers the reason they

currency and a member of the select committee on hunger i rise in strong support of this legislation i also speak as a member who comes from an agricultural state i think that what we have been able to accomplish by the recommendations for action to the legislative committees from this select committee on hunger is well worth the effort the expense of the committee i strongly encourage my colleagues to continue to support the select committee on hunger today i rise in support of the reauthorization of the select committee on hunger although i generally do have reservations about the establishment of select committees in the congress i believe the select committee on hunger has performed a valuable service to this house and to our nation and i believe that it has further important contributions to make to this house and to the foreign and domestic hunger programs of the united states and to private and multinational efforts as well to back up that conclusion i will share some examples of the committees efforts and achievements in just one area of our effort to stem the incredible hunger and starvation problems in numerous foreign countries especially africa during its first 3 years the select committee on hunger has conducted important investigations into the problems and extent of malnutrition both domestically and internationally members of the committee took a leading role along with members of key standing committees in fashioning a proposal to aid the overwhelming number of people threatened with starvation by the devastating african famine of 1984 and 1985 this initiative led to a record amount of food assistance provided by the citizens of the united states to the people of africa and i believe that less of our food and assistance was diverted from its proper destination in feeding hungry people than was the case with aid from other sources yet in 1985 alone we sent over 3 million metric tons of food to subsaharan africa by far the highest of any donor nation as a representative from one of americas agricultural states i have been interested in how the abundance from our grain belt can be used more effectively overseas to ease the problems of malnutrition in lesser developed countries without damaging domestic agriculture in recipient countries during the past 21 2 years the committee has emphasized the need for continued support and adaptation of unitedstates overseas food assistance we found for example that the public law 480 food for peace program has very significantly reduced the chronic food deficit countries in its 32 years of operation thiough both the concessional sales and food donation titles the unitedstates farm economy has benefited by exports under the food for peace program the select committee pushed for an increase in the commodity levels provided under public law 480 and the section 416 program as well as increased monetization authority for certain commodities multiyear programming agreements and the inclusion of processed foods in our overseas programs have also been adopted with the help of the latest committees efforts we are just beginning to see how the creative use and expansion of our food assistance programs can simultaneously aid in the development needs of poorer nations and the provision of new markets for our own agricultural production the select committee

availability of credit to the poor in these same developing countries can have a positive impact on creating jobs and spurring economic growth where it is vitally needed the select committee in conjunction with the banking subcommittee on international development institutions on which this member also serves has drawn to our attention the remarkable success that the unitedstates agency for international development initiatives aimed at microenterprisesone and twoperson businessescan have with a minimum of funding the select committee has issued a report detailing the benefits of such credit expansion for fledgling microenterprises and has outlined a modest plan whereby a portion of the proceeds from public law 480 title i commodity sales would be utilized to finance microenterprises in developing countries in summary the activities of the committee are worthy of continuation this member hopes that my colleagues can reach that same conclusion by reveiwing again

calendar year first of all i would like to thank all of the members of the accounts subcommittee and particularly the chairman the gentleman from pennsylvania for all of his dedication and guidance during this process which was somewhat different this year it was indeed again not an easy process at all each committee budget request deserves careful consideration each committee budget request has special needs and it is our job to ensure that the proper needs are met with appropriate funding amounts however it is also our job to determine what fat and what lean is in these budget requests and to separate them into different categories of course the total amount requested from all committees including standing committees select committees and house information systems was 52 809 981 which was 20 percent over the amount that was authorized in 1986 we managed to cut these budget requests by almost 5 million 4 902 548 to be exact and bring the total amount authorized for 1987 down to 47 907 433 or an 8 93percent increase over 1986 total authorization we all remember that last year the year of grammrudmanhollings cuts for committee budgets that meant a 9 1percent reduction across the board last year for that event made this year even more difficult because each committee came to the committee on house administration the subcommittee on accounts and reported to us that each committee in its own right had suffered greatly under the last years cut of 9 1 percent and each claimed to need special attention this year we on the subcommittee on accounts knew this to be true from our own experiences on this and the other committees upon which we serve committee travel in the united states was down numbers of hearings were reduced employees were furloughed in some cases so we were particularly sensitive to the greater needs of all the committees as they tried to make up for lost time of last year with the cut however we want gramm rudman to stand as a model not as some legislative aberration that occurred in 1 year and then would be ignored and put on the shelf forevermore that is why we worked hard to cut those requests and bring budgets down to a reasonable level while at the same time allowing room for the committees to do the jobs for whichthey are assigned we feel that we have done that with this package so i am pleased to be able to support this resolution as i have not always supported these resolutions in the past we feel that the modest increase is the best we could do given the circumstances and the particular needs throughout the committee system

different this year from previous years in that rather than handle two or three committees in 1 day and then decide their fate at the end of the day we decided it would be fitting indeed proper to handle all the committees testimony and then go over them in the relationship that each committee had to the whole amount that we thought was available we felt included on the minority side we felt to be a part of the nuts and bolts that make up this budget process i think the process worked smoothly i think the process under the tremendous constraints we felt worked well i urge my colleagues to

program i agreed with him in his approach to providing for drugs in the last session of congress i think it was patently inappropriate a violation of our trust to be up front with the american people to provide funds that were not there really to fight a problem we all took very seriously this is a different situation than we were in at the end of the last fiscal year mr obey has said it well we are messing around with an appropriations process that has not even had an opportunity to play itself out during the remainder of this fiscal year we are marking up a supplemental appropriations bill now there remains some 7 7 billion i believe in discretionary budget authority available that is not enough to satisfy all demands and we will have to make some choices in the next several months about how we are going to use that authority before the end of this fiscal year the last thing we need to do is to cause the appropriations committee to have no influence about how to allocate and apportion among our priorities as we make these decisions on the supplemental in addition there is no question that we have cut over the last 6 years some 300 billion in domestic spending out of essentially 12 of the 13 subcommittees of the house committee on appropriations everytlfing but defense to be clear we have in fact reduced our domestic budget from the congressional budget offices baseline in real terms well over 300 billion this amendment would simply force us to cut more this year out of discretionary appropriations that have declined as a percentage of the total budget by some 5 percent in the last 6 years without being able to sensitively do so without being able to set priorities on behalf of all the members it is obvious that this amendment is politically motivated it will not work more appropriately though we ought to be focusing on the job the appropriations committee will have over the next several months as i have indicated and that is not an easy one because we have already had requests that exceed the budget we have already been asked for funds by the administration by the committees the authorizing committees that really does make it impossible for us to remain within our budget amount but we cannot operate with our hands tied behind us as this amendment would require we cannot do a fair job of allocating resources if we have some automatic process working where the committee on appropriations does not have the opportunity even to comment on where we will get the funds to aid the homeless we have made the mistake of not providing enough
