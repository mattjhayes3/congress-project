afghans were shot pointblank in their forehead and killed we have lost 40 americans who have been in afghanistan trying to train afghans to be police and soldiers 40 have been killed by the trainees and when you factor in the coalition troops trying to train the afghans 70 have been killed including the 40 americans we need to continue this process of remembering those who have given so much to our country because too many times we get so wrapped up with major issues like the debt the deficit and jobs and so many important things but there is nothing more important than those young men and

acrosstheboard tax increase the combination of which will mean that if we are unable to resolve the fiscal cliff without raising taxes well already see a lot of new taxes as a result of the health care law on financial transactions on insurance programs on every single working american thats why we have speaker john boehner trying to present president obama with an alternative that says rather than raising taxes which is already going to happen on january 1 from this massive new tax increase that was in the health care bill why dont we find a way to understand and have the economy take that in hand first i know the president stood here at the state of the union address and said were not going to spend one dime of taxpayer money i know the president stood here and said every single american can keep their own insurance plan i know the president has made these promises to the american people and these are the things that were going to have to understand about january 1 of next

what would be this newif the president gets his waytax increase on working americans and in particular small business while much has been made about the debates surrounding tax rates there is i think a larger picture that we need to consider we should focus on employment and jobs instead of trying to necessarily aim for fairness just by using this weapon against small business we should focus i think on job creation we understand that if the presidents bill passes we will lose 700 000 jobs that means 700 000 americans and their families would then qualify i presume for unemployment and it would mean that we begin the new year once again on a negative pathway thats why we are here today talking and trying to have our leaders of this great nation make sure that we avoid this this country

county commissioners or supervisors this is not going to your school board there if they tax you you can go to their meetings and you can stand up at a podium and you can tell that mayor what you think about his spending habits you can tell the county chairman what you think the school board member is required by law to hear your opinion about that but when your money is taken to washington you dont have the right to even stand up and speak to the congress you try to stand up without getting permission theyve got security to drag you off there is a big difference between sending your money to city hall and sending your money to washington d c one you are vested with rights to participate in how that money is spent here in washington you are disenfranchised except for one person your congressman and that person darn well is diluted and cannot speak for you personally but has to represent you as part of a group so when we talk about washington taking money remember youve got

services that are essential to all of us we keep talking about washington is the great safety net excuse me your city and your counties are the great safety net of civilized services that we get into the federal government anybody thats lived in washington d c understands that that the local government is where the essential services have gone and when we take money out of a community and bring it here to washington were depriving those same mayors and school board members and county commissioners the essential services that make every day possible for our citizens and when we do that even more importantly we deprive the individual the ability to participate in how their hardearned money is spent so we should take as little as humanly possible to execute the responsibilities and the mandates

into our constitution by our founding fathers and which forms the very foundation of how we govern this great nation an egregious ongoing breach of the separation of powers is taking place at this very hour specifically the usurpation of a power given only to congress that found in article i section 8 of the constitution only congress can declare war known initially as operation odyssey dawn and now as operation unified protector military intervention easily rising to the definition of war is being carried out in libya it is being carried out with the bravery exceptional professionalism and commitment to victory that define our fellow americans who serve in our armed forces and before i address the mission itself i first applaud their willingness to sacrifice so much for their fellow americans a careful review of the presidents case for support of his actions in libya leads me to this sobering but firm conclusion the presidents use of force in libya is unwise and it is unconstitutional the level of military resources being employed both in personnel and equipment the amount of ordnance delivered and the damage inflicted constitute acts of war at the very minimum they meet the definition of hostilities under the war powers resolution yet not one of the three criteria delineated in the war powers resolution that would justify his action has been met there has been no declaration of war there has been no statutory authority issued there has been no evidence that an attack on american forces was imminent or had occurred now if a tomahawk missile was launched into any american city whether los angeles chicago or even my home city of virginia beach would that not meet our definition of hostilities absolutely it would now this is the pivotal issue the military force being directed toward libya easily triggers the definition of hostilities the legal opinion upon which the administration stakes the legitimacy of its actions in libya is thinner than the paper on which it is written it is not based on law but something that he refers to as the national interest a term that the president in his wisdom believes he can solely define himself his office of legal counsel concluded that president obama could rely on his constitutional power to safeguard the national interest by directing the anticipated military operations in libya which were limited in their nature scope and duration listen carefully here without prior congressional authorization disregarding the legal opinions of the pentagons general counsel and the acting head of the justice departments office of legal counsel both of whom told the white house they believed that the militarys operations in libya amounted to hostilities the president plowed ahead a presidents opinion of the war powers resolution does not negate its authority though required by law there was no check there was no balance even the broadest interpretation of article i section 8 cannot corral the interpretation held by the president of his unilateral right to engage unitedstates forces in combat it is irreconcilable with our constitution the president has taken america into a war in the

here today not motivated by partisanship now if i woke up tomorrow morning and learned that the president had taken action to defend this great country from imminent danger and attack i would be the first to stand next to him and affirm his action if america should go to war it must be done so in a very careful deliberative manner and as a last measure it must be done so in a way that is fully consistent with our constitution that is not the case here my amendment is necessary because only by using the power of the purse can we end an unwise war and meet our duty our high duty to preserve

nonresident employees unless they earn wages in the state for more than 30 days the employee would still owe an income tax to their state of residence for wages earned during the first 30 days they

already lowering costs expanding access and contributing to deficit reduction the affordable care act was a significant moment when congress once again took bold action to constrain the growth in health care spending and make insurance more accessible and affordable for all americans as the wealthiest country on the face of the earth we ought to make sure that people can get insurance and have affordable accessible health care insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to children with preexisting conditions i bet they think thats a benefit a protection that will be extended to all americans by 2014 ive had a lot of people talk to me about that provision they like it insurance companies can no longer drop americans from their policies when they get sick or impose arbitrary and unfair caps on coverage you buy insurance to make sure when you get sick you have coverage if you get very sick and need more coverage it says you cant cancel because youre really sick i think americans like that since the affordable care act was signed into law over 32 million seniors on medicare have access to free preventative services the medicare part d doughnut hole is on the path to close completely by 2020 seniors who fall into this coverage gap are right now getting a 50 percent discount on their brand drugs they like that now 360 000 small businesses have already taken

achieved but cbo has already said they dont expect it to be triggered at all over the next decade thats because the affordable care acts cost containment provisions are already having a significant impact on slowing the growth of health care and medicare spending this proves that the medicare spending can be constrained without turning medicare into a voucher program as the chairman has said
