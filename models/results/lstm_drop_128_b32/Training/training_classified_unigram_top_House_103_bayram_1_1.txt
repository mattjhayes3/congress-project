retroactively no 4 it does not even get us near a balanced budget clearly this bill is an indication if it passes of how far out of touch the white house and the congress is with the american public we should be debating here today how much we are going to cut and we should also be debating here today a bill to increase the personal exemption for children from 2 300 to 3 500 to allow moms and

regarding the size of the federal budget deficit controlling spending and balancing the budget are among the most critical issues facing congress today continued high deficits harm our nations economy we must work to keep the economy growing we must keep inflation under control interest rates low and investor confidence high to create new jobs my concern however is with the direction we are moving under the deficit reduction plan as proposed by president clinton under the best of circumstances this plan over 5 years would reduce the deficit by only one third of the estimated nearly 300 billion deficit today and thars with 275 billion in new taxes proposed in the plan this is even if the promised spending cuts in the future come to pass billions of promised cuts have fallen by the wayside over the past decade while the upfront tax increases are immediately enacted now with this budget we have the novelty of retroactive tax increases taking even more money out of the private sector will only increase the current lag in economic growth in addition contrary to claims that the presidents deficit reduction program will create jobs and grow the economy the plan is void of incentives to save invest or start up new businesses and saddles small businesses which are expected to create 75 percent of new jobs with devastating tax increases that will result in small businesses paying a higher tax rate than large multinational corporations this is not the kind of change americans are demanding it is more of the same tax and spend status quo a budget bill which forces middleincome

people from the ottoman empire greece remained under control of that empire for almost 400 yearsfrom the fall of constantinople in 1453 until the declaration of greek independence in 1821 for nearly four centuries the greek people were deprived of all civil rights schools and churches were closed down and christian and jewish boys were kidnaped and raised as moslems to serve the sultan

derive from these federal lands as well it makes counties less dependent from one year to the next on revenues from the extractive use of those lands this legislation is supported by a broad array of groups and at this late date nothing short of the precise text included in s 455 will give us a law this congress i and many of my colleagues have for years examined the issue of how to provide

reflect changes in inflation over that period of time the federal government cannot deny its par in the prosperity of these counties grants and loans counties receive from the department of education the department of housing and urban development or the department of health and human services benefit these counties tremendously it is this cooperative relationship that enables us to educate our children provide affordable housing for our citizens and provide valuable health services to our elderly we have an obligation i am not alone in my view of this legislation the sierra club and the nature conservancy share the view of many of our rural counties and many in this body the sierra club in its testimony before the senate cited its importance to rural counties we do not at the sierra club think that local governments should be punished for the presence of federal lands and that is in fact what is happening today and it continues s 455 begins to address a chronic shortfall of funding particularly for areas where federal holdings make up a large part of the land base in closing this is a fairness issue bringing current value to federal lands is not an entitlement it is just compensation these funds are all subject to appropriation and do not obligate federal spending this is why this bill does not violate our budget acts the substitute offered by the gentlemen from

health service to determine which diseases should trigger exclusion of foreign nationals federal law requires the public health service to base this determination on current epidemlological concepts and medical diagnostic standards in addition the unitedstates catholic conference writes we ask for your support in defeating any amendment that would overturn or interfere with the department of health and human services authority to make the decision about what diseases are on the exclusion list in addition the national commission on aids appointed by president bush writes the commission voices its deep distress over the encroachment once again of extraneous issues into a decision that should be sciencebased and focused solely on public health concerns we must not allow arguments based on politics misinformation fear or discrimination to triumph in addition to that the association of state and territorial health officials writes because hiv infection is not spread by casual contact and immigration of infected individuals does not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the population astho continues to support removal of hiv infection from the list of communicable diseases of public health significance upon which unitedstates travel and immigration can be denied the fact is they strongly believe that that decision should be made by the public health service apha the american public health association one of the oldest and largest associations of health professionals supports the decision toend immigration policy which bars hiv infected persons from entering the country again emphasizing the decision should be made by the public health service the list goes on and on i could quote hundreds of organizations ranging from the american bar association to the national organization responding to aids which again has scores of organizations again i would like to quote a letter to president clinton written by a group of public health organizations and hiv service providers who also support the position that the department of health and human services should be the arena where this decision is made in closing i would like to quote

taking a stance on this issue based on medical and epidemiologic truth and not on distracting and potentially harmful misconceptions we thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this important international and public health matter in conclusion i would like to say that i am sure that we all share the view that we want to stop the spread of aids in our country and in the world we all share the view that if anyone who comes into this country poses a danger or a threat to the health of americans we cannot have that happen we all share the view that we cannot have people coming in who will become a public health charge and that is a cost to the unitedstates taxpayers but the point where we differ is who makes the decision about that how contagious or what the merit is of a disease to be

in the past 4 years the language has been included in the house interior appropriations bill since fiscal year 1992 and each year negotiators with the other body have demanded this provision be stricken during the conference this year i had hoped comprehensive mining reform legislation would be enacted as bills had passed both bodies but as yet the conference has made little progress i am increasingly less optimistic that reform of this antiquated law will occur in this congress the language in question does not stop mining itdoes not require royalties it does not impose any new reclamation requirements in short it simply insures that the taxpayers retain title to the land at the termination of the mining process as an example of what has happened in denali we have several thousand acres 1 300 acres that were purchased for 6 000 total we are estimating we will have to pay 22 million to repurchase land that was sold by the goverinent for 6 000 i do not want that to happen in the future in june the mineral policy center released a report which echoed the concerns i have had over this issue for some time their report captioned golden patents empty pockets concludes that unless congress takes action during the 103d congress title to more than 34 billion in mineral resources belonging to the american taxpayers will be signed over to private mining companies for no more than 800 000 thirtyfour billion for 800 000 and with no royalties many of these companieswith pending patent appli cations are not even american businesses we are literally giving our rich mineral resourcesour gold our silver our platinumaway to foreign interests for bargain basement prices it is possibly the biggest travesty in government and yet it has been happening under an antiquated 1872 law the mineral policy center report estimates that since 1872 the federal government has given away more than 231 billion of mineral resources belonging to the public either by patent or by royaltyfree mining on public lands now i recognize that these figures do not represent profits to the mining industry certainly there are costs incurred in getting these minerals out of the ground but these figures are a clear indication that the government is not receiving a reasonable return for the taxpayers under the current law i find it incomprehensible that we are willing to give away the public lands with virtually no compensation just recently the secretary of the interior was forced to approve a patent application of the american barrick resources corp for 1 038 acres those lands hold mineral reserves valued at more than 10 billion barrick took title to the land for 5 190 and will pay no royalty on the mineral resources that until the patent was approved were owned by the federal government a canadian company has secured from the united states title to these valuable lands something it could not secure from its own government no other country that i am aware of in the world deeds their land and minerals over to industry without retaining some interest for the government patent applications have increased as congress has tried unsuccessfully in recent years to reform the mining law currently 613 patents covering 250 000 acres are being processed by blm the longer congress avoids mining reform the more likely all of the mineral resources are to leave public ownership for the bargain rate of 2 50 to 5 an acre with no chance of gaining royalty payment on the resources while many of these 613 applications are too far along in the process to be affected by my amendment if we adopt my patent moratorium we at least slow the rapid give away and maybe will require that both sides get to the bargaining table on mining reform and sthat is what should happen we should get a completion of the minirig reform conference the mineral policy center recommends an immediate patent moratorium and estimates this would save more than 10 billion in recoverable minerals reserved from being privatized by mining companies this is the fourth year that the house has adopted this language and in each of the past three it has been sacrificed for some other cause in conference if my amendment had been in place in may the secretary and that is in may of this year would not have been forced to turn over an estimated 10 billion in minerals to a canadian company the secretary himself called the land transfer quote the biggest gold heist since the days of butch cassidy while the barrick travesty is history we can take action to stop further give aways and possibly force the reluctant mining interest to the table for meaningful negotiations on comprehensive mining reform absent a patent moratorium time is on the side of the mining

everglades then as it gets further south we find the techannelization which is something we are going to have to be talk ing about later and this does impact upon florida bay where we find the turtle grass is dying and where we find that the only living reef in the united states is dying because of this runoff this is all because of the damage that has been done by mankind through development
