all americans across the nation in every major city to every small town americans are speaking with one voice saying enough is enough the american people are demanding a no fly no buy bill that prevents those on the terror watch list from purchasing firearms how have republicans responded they have put together a weak unworkable and convoluted bill that will not address the real problem imagine under this legislation law enforcement must convince a court within 72 hours that the buyer has committed or will commit an act of terrorism before it could block a gun sale is this your idea of homeland security really is this how you protect the homeland the standard is simply unreachable and unworkable now one has to wonder where republicans got such an unfeasible idea the answer is as simple as it is sad the nra which represents large weapon manufacturers wrote this legislation we need a real effective no fly no buy bill that stops those on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms the republican legislation is simply a giveaway to the nra that will hobble law enforcement we also need a system of effective universal background checks that keeps guns out of the hands of those who would do us harm once again house republicans are standing in the way they are preventing consideration of this measure that is supported by 90 percent of the american people why just to keep their friends in the nra lobby happy with them why follow the money this is unconscionable the week after the orlando slaughter i read on this floor the names of the victims at that time i said that while we will never forget them their memory will inspire us to real change but this is not real change we do not honor the victims of orlando by passing legislation written by the nra and gun manufacturing lobbyists in fact if anything this legislation is an insult to the intelligence of the american people well i have news for you the american people see through this and they are not buying it i urge my colleagues do what is right reject this unworkable nrabacked trick so that we can vote on real meaningful legislation to address gun violence in this country"],

slaughtered by the ottoman empire in the first genocide of the 20th century the sheer scale of genocide thwarts our capacity to comprehend it 1 5 million armenians killed 6 million jews killed in the holocaust 1 million tutsis the numbers become abstractions sanitized by their enormity it is only when we consider each of those lives individually that the full horror comes into focus the victims of genocide are more than victimsthey are human beings the armenians massacred from 1915 to 1923 were men women and children who were targeted in what was then an unprecedented campaign to wipe out an entire people it is our duty in the modern day to remember those lost and to bear witness that the campaign to destroy the armenian people failed we do so by speaking the truth and we do so by speaking the names of those 1 5 million and by keeping both the way they lived and the way they died alive in our memory earlier this month i asked my thousands of armenian constituents and millions of armenians around the country and the world to submit the names and stories of their family members who were killed 100 years ago the response was overwhelming thousands of people sent the names and stories of ancestors killed in the genocidethe names of infants and toddlers ripped from their mothers arms the names of children and the elderly dying of exhaustion and starvation on a forced march to deir ezzor the names of women and girls raped and brutalized and killed the names of clergy tortured and burned alive in their own churches the names of men robbed of their possessions of their homes and of their lives each victim has a name and a story from glendale to yerevan to jordan and every corner of the world where armenian diaspora lives families sent me those names and those stories it is my honor to read some of those names this hour knowing that it would take more than 1 000 hours more than 50 days to read all of them turkey may deny the genocide our administration may lack the courage to recognize the genocide our congress may lack the courage to recognize the genocide but no one can deny the humanity of its victims and no one can deny our right to speak the truth

teachers cops and nurses wont i want to continue today and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente y el comisionado residente no puede ver esta crisis como una herramienta en sus campanias para un puesto mis alto el congreso s6lo ayudari a puerto rico siempre y cuando haya un llamado constante y persistente de los puertorriquehos exigiendo que el congreso cumpla y los puertorriquehlos tienen que indicar lo que esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el pueblo debe decirle a wall street que puerto rico no es una tienda para ser pirateada y que el pueblo de puerto rico no esperari a morir de hambre mientras wall street cuenta sus ganancias si wall street esti comprando bonos con descuentos deben ser pagados con descuentos pero sobre todo tenemos que

community organizer in terms of one of the jobs that he held after school i dont know if they dislike the fact that he is so well educated from columbia and harvard law schools i dont know if it is the fact that he was the president of the harvard law review or a constitutional law professor at the university of chicago law school one of the top five law schools in this country i dont really know what it is about barack obama that they want to treat him differently than almost any other president who has served at 1600 pennsylvania avenue i am trying to figure it out what is it about barack obama that he has to be treated with such disrespect the amazing thing to me is that they have actually failed to stop this president they gave him no assistance as it relates to trying to turn the economy around he inherited a train wreck from george w bush and has gotten the economy back on track not a single member from the other side of the aisle voted for the stimulus package which was necessary to stabilize the economy and then build it up there was 71 consecutive months of private sector job creation and 14 millionplus private sector jobs were created under this presidency the

a 4year term with 325 days left all we are asking is that they just do their job it is pretty simple give whoever the president puts forth a fair hearing they have the votes to defeat any of his

we strongly urge you to oppose the stream pollution bill h r 1644 a bill expected on the house floor the week of january 11 2016 this bill would put costly and unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles in the already overburdened regulatory process with the sole intent of ensuring that coal companies can continue to destroy streams with coal wastes the present rules protecting such streams date to 1983 after the department of interior took several years to develop the proposed stream protection rule this bill requires a new study this time by the national academy of sciences on the effectiveness of the current decadesold surface mining regulation the bill carves out two years for the completion of that study and then bars doi from updating the rule for an additional year after that in the meantime communities will continue to shoulder the burden of water pollution and mining abuses the intent of these new delays is clear let the mining companies continue unimpeded with sacrificing the streams and health of the communities that surround their mines another section of the bill adds new procedural hurdles before doi can act under the surface mining law today the secretary and the heads of all rulemaking agencies regularly make available all the information relied upon concurrently with the proposed or final rule doing so enables stakeholders to weigh in during the public comment period on the basis for the proposal this bill requires doi to publish all scientific data used in a proposed rule 90 days before publication it is unclear what the intent of this redundant provision is other than to congest the regulatory system with even more process and delay if the agency fails to meet this new paperwork burden the goal of the authors is met the protections must be delayed even further unfortunately these types of delay tactics are becoming increasingly common across the regulatory spectrum as polluters attempt to dodge their responsibilities thus h r 1644

included in the voucher but in addition to that obviously you have got the true cost of the mobile home that the owner pays for the housing in addition to the land rent underneath the home mobile homeowners often pay a number of other costs including utilities insurance and financing for their mobile homes people renting apartments where it is not a mobile home all of those are factored into the rent so what this amendment would do is allow those costs to be included in the calculation for section 8 that in our view put an unnecessary and unfair limitation on what can be considered compare that to the housing cost vouchers that individuals in rental units get all of those are included in the rent so this amendment would address that issue by allowing the property taxes on a mobile home as well as insurance utilities and financing to be included as components of the housing costs eligible for a voucher it would make a huge difference in affordability for vermonters and

cummings of the oversight committee for their work on this important update of presidential legislation this is what this bill would do it would update what has become an arcane law and reduce unnecessary costs to the taxpayer the bill would amend the former presidents act of 1958 to provide a 200 000 annual pension for each former president and a 100 000 annual survivor benefit to each surviving spouse the pensions are indexed to inflation and would increase with the social security costofliving adjustment currently surviving spouses receive 20 000an interesting disparity between the spouse and the former presidentand former presidents receive a pension equal to the pay for cabinet secretaries which for 2015 is 203 700 the bill would also provide an annual allowance of 200 000 for costs associated with postpresidential life the annual allowance would replace amounts currently provided for travel staff and office expenses which totaled 3 25 million in fiscal year 2015 for the four living former presidents the allowance would be reduced dollar for dollar for every dollar a former president earns in outside income in excess of 400 000 1645 so you see there might be no presidential pension if the president does what most presidents have done which is to almost not be able to help earning outside income updating the allowance ends an unnecessary government handout to former presidents making millions of dollars after leaving office there is little reason why american taxpayers should be subsidizing these former presidents when they are making a comfortable living

more than 5 billion in unpaid federal taxes in 2004 and 2005 unpaid taxes owed by contractors include payroll taxesamounts required to be withheld from employee wagesas well as corporate income taxes

allow the federal government to make sure that contractors seeking to do business with the federal government have paid their taxes before they can receive a federal contract the federal acquisition
