friend the gentleman from florida at least recently has not denied as i have listened to the remarks of the gentleman from illinois in particular the chairman of the committee on the judiciary that the problem that we have with the bill is not whether we can understand the language or whether it is incomprehensible or not but whether or not it is a backdoor attack on roe i mean that is the question is the major bill that has caused us to create a substitute a backdoor attack on roe v wade we think that it is for the following reasons until recently the law did not recognize the existence of the fetus except for a very few specific purposes as stated by the supreme court in roe the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense that is a quote and the law that has been reluctant to afford any legalrights to fetuses quote except in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth so roe specifically rejected the suggestion that a theory of life that grants personhood to the fetus and that the law may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake so what i am suggesting is that the issue is not really the language of the substitute but it is really the deeper problem of whether an unborn child should be entitled to legal status that is unprecedented in the federal system i hope to gain the attention of the learned attorney from south carolina and that is that in the 26 years following roe v wade the supreme court has never recognized an unborn child as having legal status in state courts and state law yes and many times it has not been challenged but on the two occasions that this came before the united states supreme court they have never recognized an unborn child as having legal status the two cases that i would suggest are the burns case in 1975 and the webster v reproductive health services in 1989 these are the only two cases since roe in which the supreme court has been asked to recognize the unborn child as having legal status and in both cases the supreme court refused to do so now what does the substitute do the substitute accomplishes the same thing that the major bill does without reaching a conclusion contrary to roe v wade that has never recognized the unborn child as having legal status that is precisely the difference punishment the same objective the same abhorrence of pregnant women having their pregnancy terminated involuntarily the same but the difference in the substitute is that our substitute keeps roe v wade intact in that it maintains that the recognition of an unborn child as being entitled to legal status has never yet occurred in the law and the congress this evening is about to attempt to change that that is why we say gentlemen of the republican persuasion this is a backdoor attack on roe v wade and what we are trying to do is accomplish the same objective as the major bill without interrupting the status of roe v

known or suspected drug trafficking activities to the appropriate authorities most americans would assume that the cia would never traffic in illegal drugs and would take all necessary actions to prosecute known drug traffickers history however has proven that this is not the case for 13 years the cia and the department of justice followed a memorandum of understanding that explicitly exempted the cia from requirements to report drug trafficking by cia assets agents and contractors to federal law enforcement agencies this allowed some of the biggest drug lords in the world to operate

august of 1995 i have been investigating the allegations of drug trafficking by the nicaraguan contras duringthe 1980s my investigation has led me to the conclusion that the united states intelligence agencies knew full well about drug trafficking by the contras in south central los angeles and throughout the united states and chose to continue to support the contras without taking any action to stop the drug trafficking last year the cia inspector general released a report of investigation on drug trafficking by the contras which confirms allegations of cia knowledge of and support for drug trafficking in the united states by the contras the report provides extensive details of the evidence available to the cia regarding drug trafficking by contra rebels and their supporters even more remarkable is the fact that there is evidence that the cia was actually participating in drug trafficking activities in the late 1980s the cia began to develop intelligence on colombian drug cartels to infiltrate the cartels the cia arranged an undercover drug smuggling operation with the venezuelan national guard more than 1 5 tons of cocaine were smuggled from colombia to venezuela and then

affordable earlier this week the census bureau released the latest figures showing that nearly one million additional americans were added to the ranks to the uninsured last year we must take steps to ensure that these americans have greater access to affordable health insurance there is no doubt that the managed care reform legislation that we are considering today will result in higher insurance premiums for americans there is significant difference of opinion about how much those premiums will go up will it be one percent three percent or ten percent study after study has indicated that with every one percent increase in insurance premiums 300 000 additional americans lose their insurance that is why i believe it is so critical that these issues be considered together h r 2990 will expand insurance options for uninsured americans i am particularly pleased that the bill provides a 100 percent deduction for health insurance premiums and longterm care premiums if the taxpayer pays more than 50 percent of the premiums this is long overdue for too long americans who pay for their health insurance out of their own pockets have not had the same opportunity to deduct these expenses as do

fatalities of marine mammals with growing concern members of the committee on resources continue to hear of numerous incidents of unusual or unexplained mortality events effecting marine mammals perhaps most troubling many of thesestranding and mortality events are affecting marine mammal populations that are considered robust and healthy and regrettably while the frequency of standings is increasing we still know relatively little about what is causing this to occur in 1992 congress amended the marine mammal protection act to add a new title iv with the purpose to establish a coordinated federal state and private effort to address the problems and challenges associated with marine mammal strandings or unusual mortality events in many respects the marine mammal health and stranding program established under title iv has been effective nonetheless madam speaker we have fallen short of the goals established for this program in some cases especially the need for better analysis of rescued and diseased marine mammals and the need for additional research to determine if there are crossover connections between marine mammal strandings and human health threats in the marine environment much work still remains to be done moreover costs of stranding rescue operations have risen sharply so sharply in fact that some stranding facilities have had to sacrifice other programs which has had the effect of dampening effectiveness this legislation will give marine mammal stranding facilities better tools and financial assistance to meet this and other unmet needs of the program the grant program authorized in this bill will help relieve the financial burden currently affecting many network stranding facilities and importantly these new grants could be used to support valuable new research on dead marine mammals without cutting back funds necessary to support thehumane care and treatment of recovered live animals we also hope that the advisory group created by this bill will be effective in developing priorities for funding these new grant proposals i know that the gentleman from american samoa the ranking member of the subcommittee on fisheries conservation wildlife and oceans very much appreciates the cooperation of the gentleman from new jersey the subcommittee chairman to ensure that these grants may be used to enhance scientific investigation and are not simply used to offset operating expenses at stranded facilitates also the gentleman from american samoa also appreciates the chairmans cooperation to ensure that this legislation provides for the fair distribution of grant dol lars to all stranding network regions and also provide sufficient funds to allow the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to administer the new grant program we still contend that it makes sense to set aside some discretionary funds for emergency or technical assistance since these funds would allow noaa to fill in the gaps in coverage or to address unexpected needs that arise in the field ultimately experience will determine whether this additional flexibility is needed the marine mammal health and stranding program is vital to the protection and rehabilitation of thousands of marine mammals annually but the program can be improved i believe the new grant program created by this legislation will provide additional financial resources to support the national network of stranding facilities will increase our understanding of marine mammal ecology and will increase public awareness of the health and safety of the

have tomorrow is not about a marriage penalty everyone agrees everyone has a plan we will talk about the differences in the plans but everyone agrees that there needs to be a correction it was an

potential investors if he just says trust me i do not have a plan yet i cannot see the big picture i am not sure where we are going to be in 10 years but i just need some money because i have this little bitty plan or this notion that is out there i suggest that this company will not make it very far let me take it one step further what would have happened under the trustme notion if this congress would have passed the 1 trillion tax cut last year everyone agrees that after we look at discretionary spending caps we look at some emergency spending that we only are going to have a projected 780 plus billion surplus over the next 10 years think about that if we would have passed a 1 trillion tax cut last year we only have 780 billion projected today and it has only been 6 months we would be running a deficit before the tax cut even was fully engaged so i beg the republican majority to take a look not at the fact that we need a tax cut i am going to vote for a marriage penalty tax cut the america people will have a tax cut bill that will have a marriage penalty decrease in it i feel good about that i am almost confident that tlt is going to happen but let us put it in an overall budget frame let us lay out our plan that is the responsible thing to do we have been very disciplined fiscally over the last several years that is why we are here today that is why we can enjoy and have this debate which i guess several years ago we would not have even had about the problems we have with the kinds of surplus that we are predicting we need to continue and i beg the majority to show us a road map give us a plan we want to cut taxes i am going to vote for it the blue dogs will vote for it the democrats will vote for it and everyone wants it it fits in a plan but we ought to spend half of whatever that surplus is in paying down the debt first 25 percent in a targeted tax cut that should include the marriage penalty and will i believe and 25 percent for priority spending we have heard my colleagues talk about some of the other spending needs that we have in this country how do we know if they are more important than something else until we look at the business plan there is not one person businessperson in america that could go to the bank and borrow some money today and say i do not have a business plan but i need some money show us a plan

myself such time as i may consume this bill walls off the surplus in the medicare part a trust fund it says in effect that the surplus in the presidents budget and in the congressional budget resolution should be at least as large every year as the medicare part a surplus in addition of course tax cuts and spending increases could not reach that target the idea of taking the part a trust fund off the table not off the budget is a small step forward because it means that a slightly higher share of the projected surpluses over the next 10 years are going to be devoted to paying down publiclyheld debt that is good for social security that is good for medicare that is good for the economy that is why i voted yes but this is just a small step a token step since preserving the medicare surplus does not really extend medicare solvency for one day our longterm fiscal situation implies that over the course of the next 10 years while we are generating these onbudget surpluses we should be devoting a significant share of them to medicare solvency to debt reduction and to social security solvency for the long run o 1445 that is why i said earlier on the previous bill that we ought to have a piece of legislation here which simply says we resolve that now and into the future we will set aside some fixed percentage of our own budget surplus every year for debt reduction or for contribution to these trust funds the clinton administration and our congressional democratic budget resolution devoted more than 40 percent of the projected onbudget surplus to debt reduction and we took 300 billion out of the general fund that is out of the onbudget surplus and put it in the medicare trust fund in order to extend the solvency of the medicare program into and past 2020 the blue dog budget which was offered as an alternative committed 50 percent of the projebted onbudget surplus to debt reduction but the republican plan devoted essentially none of the surplus to debt reduction and took none of it none of it and put it into medicare where it would ensure at least extend the solvency of the program unlike the proposal made the other day by vicepresident gore as i have noted this bill fails to take the medicare trust fund off budget it simply takes it off the table or out of the calculation in addition it has something in it that i would call a trap door in fact it was in the social security legislation too specifically any legislation that identifies itself as social security reform or medicare reform it only has to recite those magic words is automatically exempt without further proof from the provisions of this lockbox this is very much like the emergency spending exemption that we have got in current law any legislation that is designated an emergency by somebody no matter how routine is exempt from the spending caps the same can happen with medicare reform and social security reform the bill itself says in black letters all one has got to do is recite this bill is for medicare reform this bill is for social security reform and bang these provisions no longer apply to one finally if the majority were really serious about using projected surpluses to reduce debt and save and protect medicare and social security then i think they would take this bill this occasion to repeal section 213 of the budget resolution which they passed weeks ago in just a few weeks the congressional budget office is going to increase its estimate of the projected onbudget surpluses by 800 billion a trillion dollars maybe 1 2 trillion maybe more section 213 of their budget resolution will allow the chairman of the committee on the budget to commit give devote as much as 100 percent of that increase in the projected surplus to the committee on ways and means for additional tax cuts instead of debt reduction instead of saving social security instead of protecting medicare use 100 percent of it for tax reduction if my colleagues were serious about debt reduction serious about protecting medicare and social security surely surely we would say some of these additional surpluses will be retained set aside and protected for these
