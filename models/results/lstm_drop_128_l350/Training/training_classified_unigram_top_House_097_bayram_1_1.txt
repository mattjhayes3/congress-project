last several weeks we have increasingly been reading in the press and we have been hearing from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that reaganomics is not working that the republicans are the party of high interest rates and that inflation is not coining down and that there is no productivity that is exactly the opposite of what is happening we have here a few figures which i think the members will find very enlightening in 1976 in the last year of a republican administration under president ford the inflation rate by the consumer price index was but 4 8 percent by 1977 it had climbed to 6 8 percent by 1978 it had climbed to 9 percent by 1979 it had climbed to 13 3 pecent and by 1980 it had reached 12 4 percent in 1081 it is expected that the inflation rate will end up being about 9 5 percent and in 1982 it will drop further into the low 8s or the high ts that is a dramatic change in direction from the direction we had been going in over the previous 4 years of rapidly rising inflation rates we have turned the corner and inflation has started to come down if we look at productivity we see that over the last 4 years productivity has had an absolutely abysmal record in 1976 the last year under a republican administration productivity as measured by output per hour had climbed by 3 3 percent in 1977 productivity only increased 2 1 percent in 1978 we had a negative productivity growth of minus 0 2 percent in 1979 we had a negative productivity growth of minus 0 3 percent and in 1980 we had a negative productivity growth of minus 0 2 percent it is projected that for 1981 productivity will grbw by 1 4 percent this is the first year in 5 years that productivity has grown and not gone down that is a dramatic turnabout in productivity the republicans are quite often right now accused of being the party of high interest rates that is just not the case at all if we look at what happened to interest rates in the last 5 years we find that in 1976 the average 3month treasury bill rate for the calendar year was 5 percent in 1977 the average rate was 5 3 percent in 1978 the average rate was 7 2 percent in 1979 the average 3month treasury bill rate was 10 percent in 1980 the average 3month treasury bill rate was 11 5 percent and on january 1 1981 the 3month treasury bill rate was 14 7 percent under the last auction that came out yesterday the 3month treasury bill rate had fallen to 11 1 percent for the first time in 5 years we see the treasurybill rates going down not going up if we look a~t the real gross national product growth we see that in 1976 real gnp climbed to 5 4 percent in 1977 the real gnp growth climbed 5 5percent but from that point on gnp went down in terms of growth rates 4 8 percent in 1978 3 2 percent in 1979 in 1980 a negative rate of 0 2 percent it is projected that in 1981 the year we are in now we will have a real gnp of 9 1 percent once again for the first time in 5 years real gnp is on the

total national investment in research and development in recent years has come from various agencies of the federal government the united states has led the free world in this investment both as a percentage of gnp and in the absolute size of its investmentover 60 billion in 1980which is twice that of the nearest itdustrialized country japan this is one of the main reasons that unitedstates scientists have been in the forefront of every scientific and technological discipline and why our economic political and military supremacy remained essentially unchallenged in the two decades following world war ii but there are signs that our scientific leadership is gradually being eroded according to the national research council unitedstates fundamental research now constitutes only about onethird of the world total and another third done in the soviet bloc and the remainder in western europe and japan total research and development expenditures by the major european countries have risen from less than half the unitedstates level in 1965 to twothirds today there has also been a steady decline in the percentage of gnp we invest in research and development according to the national science foundation between 1963 and 1978 this index declined 22 percent in the united states while it rose 13 percent in france 33 percent in japan and 62 percent in west germany japan in particular has been accelerating the pace of its research and development investments which in 1980 reached about 2 2 percent of its gnpnearly the same as the united states the implications of this decline are serious not just for our national pre tige or the number of nobel prizes we win but for our competitiveness in world markets testimony by the able subcommittee chairman of our aviation

the sites for deployment of this system in addition this year we got the library of congress to set up an allday seminar with naval officers and other experts testifying as to possible alternative

cited the experience we had when the defense department did its own restudy subsequent to that i was gratified to see he did appoint the townes commission which is due to make its report sometime around the end of june now i suggest to my colleagues that this is an extremely serious matter not only because we are talking about spending at least 50 billion and if there is no salt ii treaty or the equivalent 100 billion or even more on this system we are also talking about a system that many experts say is going to be vulnerable from the word go that even by the air forces own admission will not address the russian missile threat until almost the complete deployment of the 4 600 shelters and 200 missiles in 1989 and even that is assuming that there is a salt ii ceiling on the total number of warheads that either side may possess if there is no salt ceiling then we may find ourselves with a system that will never do the job that this is supposed to do so i think it is a very

republican can be proud of the work done on this tax measure or its substitute the outrageous bidding war of the last few months has produced a disastrous tax policy that americans will have to live with for years to come billions of dollars have literally been bargained away on both sides until now it is hard to distinguish what differences there are between the two primary proposals no philosophy will win with this vote since both bills are a mishmash of tax loopholes tax cuts and tax giveaways this is a far cry from the original proposals to cut individual taxes and encourage investments savings and capital formation on monday night the president said that his version had something for c~veryone and it surely does if you are rich enough to take advantage of the provisions beyond the much discussed 50 000 difference under which those making less than 50 000 do better with the demrocratic plan than they do under the reagan plan there are other major differences for example the oil industry which already accounts for more than onethird of all unitedstates industrial profits would receive 16 billion in tax breaks under the reagan plan the democratic proposal is not much better as it gives away 10 billion to an industry which only a few months ago was largely decontrolled from price regulation the stated objectives of this oil tax giveaway plan are to produce more domestic oil and gas and to become energy selfsufficient it sounds good but when one takes a closer look at both provisions one notices that a good portion if this relief will go to taxpayers who own royalty interests in oilproducing properties but who do not make decisions about production much of the rest would go to independent oil producers who lack the corporate resources needed to undertake more complex exploration projects i would keep in mind when one looks at any tax cut or giveaway that someone else usually the average working man and woman will have to pay to make up the difference on top of the energy tax benefitsread oil tax benefitsboth proposals have generous piovisions for dividend reinvestment and both incorporate the all savers plan this plan appears quite reasonable but only a week ago president reagan opposed it now he advocates it an estate tax exemption is necessry and fair but the proposal submitted by both the democratic and republican bills is ludicrous it is estimated that this provision which would benefit only the top 3 percent on the income scale could amount to a whopping 4 million tax break for the beneficiaries of a 25 million estate the only positive element from the estate and gift tax proposal is the tax free unlimited transfer of property to the spouse it is something we should have done long ago in recognition of the financial and emotional support a spouse gives and needs but despite the drawbacks the massive giveaways the christmas tree appearance of both bills i must reluctantly support the ways and means committee version of the largest tax cut in american history i fear that neither bill will do what their proponents suggest but the democratic bill comes closer it will not do enough to increase productivity reduce unemployment encourage savings or improve the economy but neither would the program submitted by president reagan i suspect that whichever program we approve in a few years hence we will be discussing the same problems we do todayhigh unemployment rising interest rates unacceptable inflation and staggering federal budget deficitsin short we will be struggling over a battered economy despite the rhetoric neither this nor the budget cuts will be our salvation nonetheless i will support the wayls and means committees proposal not because it is good but because it is better better for the people of my district better for working class america it is the distribution not of wealth but of sweeteners anid as reluctant as i am to say it i choose the democr ts sweetenners unlike the presidents proposal the democrats have improved the child care tax credits increasing child care credits to 40 percent for taxpayers with incomes below 11 000 and phasing down the rate to 20 percent for those incomes from 11 000 to 30 000 the democrats version also has a much better marriage penalty deduction of up to 5 000 versus the presidents 3 000 and finally the democrats plan favors small businesses the very entity which creates over 90 percent of all new jobs perhaps the most significant difference between these two proposals is in the treatment of small business true the president would reduce paperwork and accounting difficulties with his 1053 depreciation plan but the real beneficiaries of this plan will be industries with longlived and outdated assets and investments on the other hand the democrats have proposed a truly innovative approach called expensing this process would benefit one of the most productive and fastestgrowing industries in americaelectronics an area where worldwide americans are in the forefront it would also incredibly simplify and streamline paperwork and accounting procedures at this time i would like to compliment the sponsors of both pieces of legislation in recognizing the importance of research and development by providing tax credits to businesses small business must survive and prosper if our economy is to improve and grow the democratic version is simply far superior in this respect nonetheless this will not entirely counteract the expense and waste of these giveaway proposals politicians sometimes find this hard to believe but i do not really believe that americans are so simpleminded or so selfish as not to read this present behavior as mere political shenanigans the president talked of balanced budgets just a little over a month ago but has proposed a tax cut that will surely create massive deficits in the years to come we in congress are not fools nor sheep to be led to slaughter

stinted on training and readiness we have been willing to pour untold sums into those very badly managed defense r d and procurement programs and let no one here think that those two issues are unrelated because if you really want strong defense one of the things you want is for the united states to have the capacity to project conventional force anywhere in the world that our strategic interests are threatened there is no question as one looks at the history of the defense budgets that have been passed by recent congresses that we have been denying ourselves that capacity because we are continually overspending on the glamorous procurement programs and not providing the nuts and bolts that we need so that the military can function we have our forces in europe keeping their planes
