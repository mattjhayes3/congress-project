rights of the house so we could work out the language and we withdrew the amendments the gentleman from colorado the gentleman from louisiana the gentleman from california and i and the staffs sat back and worked out the language of the perfecting amendment and the reason is this let me go through just briefly what this is about the problem is that when the federal government wants to take land away from private citizens under eminent domain or anything else quite often there is not the money to pay for the land and in the meantime that rancher homeowner or private owner has to live under the restrictions and cannot improve the land therefore the land goes down in value and by the time the federal government pays that individual the land may be worth a nickel on the dollar that is not right and the gentleman from california agrees with that what our amendment did not make clear is that we want in the meantime for the rancher or the private owner to be able to go ahead and utilize the land in a normal way we do not want as the gentleman from california suggested in his perfecting amendment to add toxic waste dumps in that area which would really deflate the value of the land when the federal government took it over and it would cost billions of dollars to take it over or to affect the mining act on parks so we have worked it out and i think the gentleman from colorado the

shortfall in the clinton budget in defense just to do what we have to do is about 1 million jobs a 50 billion cut is about i millions jobs let me go to something that i think is also important here that is confidence in the 1980s americans had differences on many occasions with president reagan and with president bush but one thing they had that allowed them to sleep a little bit better at night was the knowledge that under those two administrations they could be confident that we had a strong military that means that if their son was out on a mission halfway around the world and was in the marine corps he was out in some very difficult situation they knew number one that their son had the best equipment you could find in the world today they knew number two that their son was accompanied by a lot of bright young mean who had been selected through a very vigorous process to be marines for example if he was in the marine corps who had a high degree of education and had excellent excellent leadership they knew that they were safe they knew that they could sleep easily because they had a strong national security the american people during the 1980s learned that it is a truism that you achieve peace through strength they had a lot of confidence i think in secretary of defense dick cheney our last secretary of defense during desert storm i think they had a lot of confidence in general schwarzkopf in colin powell in the team that had been assembled under president reagan and bush it is interesting a lot of people decried president reagans socalled star wars initiative when he said you know there are a lot of ballistic missiles around the world and they are making more all the time and i think it might be important for us to learn how to shoot those down because some of those might be incoming at some point i remember presidential candidate walter mondale who said that is war in the heavens shooting down missiles sdi that is war in the heavens and i will not engage in war in the heavens yet when we shot down those scud missiles that were incoming at our troops in desert storm i am sure that walter mondale said because of ronald reagan thank heavens so the american people had a lot of confidence today there is not cause for confidence under president clinton and there is not cause for confidence because president clinton has no 1 refused to provide the numbers of equipment and men and women that are necessary to handle a dangerous world that is a twoconflict world because you have to bet that if you are involved in a conflict somewhere another guy may come and jump on you knowing that you are vulnerable knowing that your forces are occupied the president has not given us a twoconflict force no 2 he has not even funded the force he has given us he is 50 billion short what that means i think it is important that the gentleman from top gun speak on this point because what that really means and we both know it is that in the end when we run short of money the place where you can get cash fast is out of the spare parts account out of the readiness account where you repair your aircraft and that means that more youhg

high to create new jobs my concern however is with the direction we are moving under the deficit reduction plan as proposed by president clinton under the best of circumstances this plan over 5 years would reduce the deficit by only one third of the estimated nearly 300 billion deficit today and thars with 275 billion in new taxes proposed in the plan this is even if the promised spending cuts in the future come to pass billions of promised cuts have fallen by the wayside over the past decade while the upfront tax increases are immediately enacted now with this budget we have the novelty of retroactive tax increases taking even more money out of the private sector will only increase the current lag in economic growth in addition contrary to claims that the presidents deficit reduction program will create jobs and grow the economy the plan is void of incentives to save invest or start up new businesses and saddles small businesses which are expected to create 75 percent of new jobs

countries without congressional approval the debate in the senate illustrates the continuing concern in congress over the worsening political and economic crisis in haiti as early as january of this year i wrote to president clinton urging him to lift trade sanctions against haiti currently the united states is enforcing an embargo begun by the organization of american states which prohibits nearly all trade with haiti the only exceptions being humanitarian goods such as food and medicine the trouble with this policy i argued to the president is that it has had little effect in restoring democratic rule to that desperately poor country i also wrote however there is widespread agreement that the embargo has had one devastating effect it has forced the haitian people into even deeper economic deprivation that is even truer today haiti is ruled by ruthless military officers whose main concern is to retain power and who have nothing to gain by allowing the return of mr aristide or by keeping promises made to the united nations when i visited haiti a few years ago i observed first hand the grinding poverty and economic chaos a countrys economy even in an economic basket case like haiti is actually a patchwork of transactions destroying one part leads to the devastation of other parts that is why the international sanctions cannot help but destroy what little semblance of commerce once existed in haiti also exempting food and medicine has not saved the haitian people from nearstarvation and an almost complete shutdown of haitis rudimentary health care system on october 21 the washington post in a frontpage story reported that even aristides staunchest supporters now resent the economic sanctions which are making life progressively more difficult i am afraid that if the united states and the united nations continue their present policy of sanctions the likely result will be thousands of deaths from starvation and disease in haiti coupled with additional thousands of refugees teeming to united states shores in creaky boats hoping to escape their nations growing imisery certainly the united states bas an interest in political events in haiti but a series of crippling economic sanctions are not going to turn hardened military leaders away from their tyranny poverty and dictatorship ususily go hand in hand our policy of further impoverishing haiti not only

thurman and i are offering the conditthurman amendment to commercejusticestate appropriations for fiscal year 1995 this amendment provides 600 million to local and state governments which have born the cost of incarcerating criminal aliens a cost which is a federal responsibility as you know the immigration reform and control act of 1986 authorizes reimbursement to states for these costs in section 501 which is codified in 8 united states code 1365 in addition on april 20 the house approved our amendment authorizing reimbursement for incarcerating criminal aliens in an enbloc amendment that was adopted by a vote of 402 to 22 600 million is the amount scored by the congressional budget office as necessary to fully reimburse state and local governments in fiscal year 1995 illegal immigration is a federal responsibility yet we are abdicating this responsibility the conditthurman amendment give congress the opportunity to ownup to its commitments and provides the funding for reimbursing state and local governments after many years of allocating scarce resources to their jails and prisons criminal aliens are in state and county jails because the federal government has failed to enforce immigration laws the unitedstates criminal alien population totals 4 percent of all the unitedstates prison population california alone incarcerates 55 percent of all criminal aliens in the united states and can no longer continue to be expected to pay for costs which the federal government has failed to pay a 2 5 percent cut across the board is the only fair way of funding this program with regard to the byrne program the 20 1 reduction could be considered the incarcerated alien portion of the 446 million increase of byrne our amendment still leaves sizable amount of 784 2 million for state law enforcement programs under byrne therefore states without incarcerated criminal aliens do not lose under our amendment another important provision of the conditthurman amendment is that these funds would be appropriated directly to section 501 of the immigration reform and control act versus the current proposal of filtering criminal alien reimbursement moneys through the byrne grant formula this policy does not do justice to states because by filtering funds through the byrne formula you force states to choose between reimbursing for criminal aliens and much needed law enforcement programs like additional police officers on crime prevention programs lastly under the formula currently mandated for the byrne grant program states with no criminal alien populations get a larger share of the moneys but will not have tb make the tough choices that criminal alien impacted states will have to make we must protect this reimbursement by separating it from other department of justice programs which may be subject to pressures from other programs within and outside the doj the conditthurman amendment is supported by national and international law enforcement

in the world which is a threat we are outspending that nation by at least 10 to 1 and if we combine all of the nations which we fear the socalled rogue nations all of their defense spending combined the united states outspends them by a margin of almost 15 to 1 this comes down to some pretty tough choices as budget debates will which is more important to america the defense of japan or the defense of american families against crime which is more important to america building president reagans cold war relic the star wars program or building a health care system which protects millions of uninsured working families which is more important to our future better schools or better trident missiles why in the world should we cut money to be spent on medical research so that we can turn around and give the department of defense the only increase over the budget deficit agreement of last year many argue that these are false choices i disagree as the chairman of an appropriations subcommittee i am facing a freeze in spending it is not pleasant i think the department of defense should be up against the same kind of a standard let me close by saying this next week we will have a vote on the balanced budget amendment we will hear some of the most soaring rhetoric in the world about cutting spending take a close look at this roll call and find out how many of these balanced budget warriors are going to sign up today to actually cut 2 5 billion in spending"], [0.974392831325531, 0.025607168674468994, 1, "madam chairman i yield myself the balance of my time i want again to read from the committee report because the question is not whether or not we have succeeded in interdicting we have the question is whether the fact that some percentage of drugs grown or shipped is interindicted has any significant beneficial effect within the united states the fact is that some of my market economy friends have lost track of the power of the market economy unfortunately in this case market forces sometimes work whether they are legal or illegal we get substitution we get a powerful drive to sell something that is very profitable the problem with interdiction is not that it does not work on its own terms but that the success of interdiction has very little if any physical effect within the united states and because resources are limited the billions we spend on interdiction prevent us from putting more money into law enforcement treatment and education these are the three separate issues we are not simply talking about treatment that is very important but so is education which does seem to have significant effects and i believe is more responsible for the decline in the use of drugs than anything else certainly more than interdiction the committee report itself says this is the public committee report there are differing views on how progress inthe war on drugs ought to be measured if you measure by physical quantities interindicted or overseas drug people arrested it succeeds others believe that progress should be measured by reductions in the amount of drugs flowing into the united states and increases in the street prices of the drugs that result if the latter is used as a measure then the war on drugs might be considered a failure that is the point if one batch is interdicted another batch replaces it if it is shut down in one country this is a big world they will grow it in h15886 myanmar they will grow it here they will grow it there the problem with interdiction is that for a free society with the free movement of people and goods that we fortunately have and do not want to give up it is physically impossible significantly to reduce the availability of that very small and sadly very valuable quantity therefore we are wasting that money i am not talking about cutting out all the money we cannot get into specifics intelligence help and cooperation with countries that want to help would still be here but the physical emphasis on interdicting is a mistake when this was first offered to the defense department in the early 1980s as i remember they did not want to do it they said this is not for us this is not useful that was at a time when they were getting all the money they needed from congress now that they are in a budget crunch the defense department looks more favorably on this because it helps them support some of their arguments but it is not the way to fight drugs it is not effective the problem is that given that overwhelming demand that tragically exists we get it in here we stop it in one country it comes through another we stop this shipment another shipment comes in that is the problem the problem is practicality the power of market forces even though in an illegal market overwhelm the ability of law enforcement in the freest society in the world with the greatest exchange of goods that comes in and out to stop it therefore i believe we ought to begin the process of shifting resources we will then decide among ourselves there is deficit reduction there is local law enforcement there is education and there is treatment all four of those seem to me to be preferable to the time wasting and money wasting policy that we now have madam chairman i yield back the balance of my time"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0005470514297485352, 0.49945294857025146, 1, "smokefree facilities are
