the years but despite the promises made to sell them to an increasingly skeptical public they have manifestly failed to open foreign markets for unitedstates producers or even to limit predatory foreign commercial practices such as subsidizing dumping and exchange rate manipulation in fact the trade flows clearly shows that the main new accomplishments of these trade agreements have been to help unitedstates and foreignbrand automakers alike supply the american market from lowwage export platforms like mexico as symbolized by the ludicrously unequal auto tariffs left in place by unitedstates negotiators of china trade deals unitedstates policy on automotive trade with china is speeding down the same road and will likely produce the same results the united states still runs a small trade surplus in autos with china but since 2000 chinese auto eiports to the united states have outpaced the united states vehicle exports to china by a fourtoone ratio the unfair chinese

very important statement the proposal relates to the civil forfeiture provision of 18 unitedstatesc 981 and would add a section that would allow civil plaintiffs to attach judgments to collect compensatory damages for which a terrorist organization has been adjudged liable and from the pool of assets that have been forfeited under section 981 this is distinctive because this pertains to circumstances of terrorism but not necessarily in circumstances when we are at war my amendment seeks to allow victims of terrorism who obtain civil judgments for damages caused in connection with the acts to attach foreign or domestic assets held by the united states government under 18 unitedstatesc section 981 g calls for the forfeiture of all assets foreign or domestic of any individual entity or organization that is engaged in planning or perpetrating any act of domestic or international terrorism as we look at h r 3199 the patriot act it misses the opportunity to in fact allow victims to satisfy judgments that is the key for example the sobero case where the gentleman from riverside california was beheaded by abu sayyaf leaving his children fatherless the administration responded to this incident by sending a thousand special forces officers to track down the perpetrators yet the family of this decreased could not claim any compensation for the tragedy that occurred the same thing occurred with the iran hostages which many of us are familiar with but are my colleagues aware of the situation with our american servicemen who were harmed in the libyansponsored bombing of the la belle disco in germany they were obstructed from being able to enforce judgments that they received against the terroristsponsored attack and the attack that was sponsored by libya in addition a group of american prisoners tortured in iraq during the persian gulf war were barred from collecting their judgment from the iraqi government i do believe in conference we will have the opportunity to vet this and to work with all the parties concerned to finally bring some relief on this issue many members have attempted to bring about relief in special claims for their particular individual constituents in their particular jurisdictions fortunately in the opportunity we have today by including this sense of congress in the patriot act we will finally get both our debate and we will get action i bring attention as well to the world trade center bombing victims who were barred from obtaining judgments against the iraqi government in their claim against the iraqi government the victims were awarded 64 million against iraq in connection with the september 20 2001 attack however they were rebuffed in their efforts to attach the vested iraqi assets while the judgment rendered was sound the second circuit court of appeals affirmed the lower courts finding that the iraqi assets now transferred to the unitedstates treasury were protected by unitedstates sovereign immunity and were unavailable for judicial attachment one major problem that frustrates the objective of my amendment is the fact that information is not publicly available regarding the amount and or kind of civil forfeitures made to date so this amendment will allow the full discussion by a sense of congress of what would be the right process to proceed balancing the needs of the government balancing the needs of the victims of terrorism balancing the question of justice and yes balancing the responsible actions under the patriot act protecting us against terrorism but then when we are victims of terrorism to give us the opportunity for relief i would hope my colleagues would support this amendment so we can carry this forward into conference and be able to provide the kind of leadership necessary for the throngs of victims those who have already suffered and we hope not but for those who may suffer in the future i would say that absent this public disclosure of this very substantial information

not clear the language applies to any advanced research and development that is funded by the secretary which may inappropriately extend the exemption far beyond barda to other research funded by the

reject any idea that israel should not exist unfortunately this did not happen this reminds me of the time that dr king led as he moved into the time when inore groups began to circle and intervene in the movement as we called it and he welcomed the youngsters and those who had provocative and different thoughts he knew that the ultimate end was what they all cherished and that is the elimination of the shackles of segregation and racism and the divide of this country that was then black and white but dr king had to make a very important decision whether or not this movement required his standing firm on denouncing violence so he had to reject some of the groups who came to the circle of the movement he had to stand for nonviolence he had to stand for the movement being one that we could seek the plateau of freedom without violence and so i stand here today because i want to at least express the fact that those of us who argue for the opportunities around the world for the peace around the world for the elimination of the shackles of the sudanese people and who claim that we want that kind of fierce and absolute pressure on government have to be able to understand this legislation i want divestiture and sanctibns in sudan and so clearly i have to understand that there are times when we must intervene in order to make the point so that freedom might live i hope president abbas will meet with the prime minister the new prime minister of israel i hope that they will find a common ground and a way to promote peace but at the same time i think it is important that we make a firm stand to find in our hearts and our minds the ability to stand up to hamas and ask them to reject violence but also to say these three words israel can exist that is what we are asking for tonight i guess i speak as one who has a great kinship and friendship with many muslims around this nation and this world particularly i speak tonight to those palestinian americans who are frustrated and confused by legislation such as this i beg of them to link arms with all of us and demand of the hamas that they rid themselves of this violence so their children can learn so the sick and the feeble can be taken care of but i do thank the authors of this legislation for putting these exceptions in and they can be read clearly that health and humanitarian needs can be taken care of and educational needs can be taken care of with the consultation of this congress this is a very difficult time there are hard choices to make and i would argue that the arab league has been if you will absent from the team the arab league has been absent from this process so as i close let me say that there is fault everywhere we can blame anyone and everyone but it is clear what has to be done that is the denouncing of violence i want to say to our friends here in america palestinian friends and others you can be part of this solution we are not here to undermine the children of palestine or the women or the families or those who are sick but we are here to heal the land and to cause an opportunity for peace so that two states can live along with each other i cannot be a hypocrite tonight and as i cry out for sudan i must cry out for peace between israel and the palestinians i hope this legislation will begin the debate and i hope the arab league and others will join us in this fight for freedom i rise today to support and express my views on h r 4681 the palestinian antiterrorism act for the last few months we have watched the middle east transform once again and every day we have witnessed history in the making israel experienced the end of an era when the honorable ariel sharon was disabled by a powerful stroke israel also resurrected its government into an entity focused on stability and the necessity of safety the palestinian authority successfully elected a new govemment in the spirit of democracy i had the opportunity this past january to visit israel to once again tread the soil of the holy land and meet with state officials to discuss the ramifications of mr sharons illness and prospects of peace in the middle east at the time apprehension toward the upcoming palestinian elections was tangible and the israeli elections were not too far in the future all of israel and the middle east knew that this was a turning point now however we have a conundrum where we want to encourage and celebrate a democratic election we are dismayed that the party elected has a history that disappoints hopes of peace and a mutually beneficial resolution in the near future until we can achieve a twostate solution with lasting peace we must address the fact that the government now in power has not met the baseline requirements for returning to the discussion table over the last few months we have seen the palestinian people elect a government athat promised more organization and resilient public administration as well as less corruption and abuse of its citizens however the charter of hamas remains committed to the destruction of the nation of israel and the supremacy of the islamic faith around the world the palestinian authority is struggling to deliver the stability it promised on the campaign trail h r 4681 states that it shall be unitedstates policy to promote the emergence of a democratic palestinian governing authority that denounces and combats terrorism upholds human rights for all people and has agreed to recognize israel as an independent jewish state the palestinian antiterrorism act of 2006 would freeze aid to the palestinian authority pa and nongovernmental agencies ngos unless for educational needs and overridden by the president operating in the west bank and gaza so long as hamas or any other terrorist group is a part of the palestinian government the palestinian antiterrorism act puts in place a stringent benchmark that must be met by the pa before america resumes aid the aid will not be resumed until the president certifies that the pa is not controlled by and does not include terrorist groups and that the pa has demonstrated substantial progress towards a number of specified goals i know we can have peace if people of good will no matter what their faith help denounce violence and begin to work for two peaceful states i hope that this bill will not be misinterpreted as stifling the palestinian authority or harming the palestinian people this bill has been carefully written to make a compelling statement against any government that would challenge the sovereignty of another nation and yet preserve the international aid and support to a people in need of stability we welcome prime minister ehud olmert this week to address a joint meeting of congress i hope that while he is here we may discuss actions that will serve to dissuade stakeholders from violence and actions that will be a catalyst toward peace and stability in the middle east one event occurred this week that fills me with hope deputy prime minister shimon peres and foreign minister tzipi livni met with palestinian president mahmoud abbas on the sidelines of the world economic forum in sharm elsheik egypt achieving the highestlevel public talks between israel and the palestinian authority in months while the discussion focused on ideas for alleviating palestinian humanitarian problems both sides said it could lead to a first olmertabbas summit i am pleased that conversations between the governments continue and i hope that we do indeed see such a summit in the coming months"],

the managers amendment a lot of us like the preference for the gulf areas some of the restrictions on what people do with the use of funds there are three small provisions in the mhanagers amendment

recognized that this is something the legislatures should contend with and that is precisely whatwe are doing today on the house floor congress needs to take action we need to take it immediately our

dangerous abuse and so doctors in most states even prohibit them for being prescribed for medicinal purposes that is a standard that is the national standard the issue was raised about states rights but no one has raised the issue about states rights about the other drugs that are schedule i drugs but we do have a right a constitutional right and an obligation to regulate drugs in america the question really is is marijuana among them and it is and so we would be seeking to by this amendment usurp that decision and change that standard but with regard to the addictive nature of marijuana i am looking at a study here that says that if adults started at a fairly young age say by the time of 26 orolder they used marijuana before the age of 15 62 percent reported a lifetime cocaine use 9
