the rapid increase in sensitivity to the needs of the disabled and the protection of their rights i would like to underscore provisions in the bill i offered in subcommittee the developmental disabilities program has its origins in a 1963 law which applied only to individuals who were mentally retarded over time congress has expanded the definition so that those efforts now include a broad spectrum of functional limitations currently under the law a developmental disability includes any severe chronic disability which a is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical impairments b is manifested before the person attains age 22 1 c is likely to continue indefinitely d results in substantial functional limitations in 3 or more areas of life activity i selfcare ii receptive and expressive language iii learning iv mobility v selfdirection vi capacity for independent living and vii economic selfsufficiency and e reflects the persons need for a combination and sequence of special interdisciplinary or generic care treatment or other services which are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated in our hearings we learned that many states construe the definition far more narrowly as a result many eligible individuals are not being reached in many states disabilities attributable to physical impairments such as cerebral palsy and epilepsy or developmental disabilities attributable to a combination of mental and physical impairments are not reached by the advocacy and planning of the state councils which administer this program the bill before us would require each state to develop a process to identify those individuals and report to congress on ways of fully serving the developmentally disabled population states would be required to hold public hearings to bring out the views and recommendations of developmentally disabled individuals and advocacy organizations the goal of the program is to assure that persons with developmental disabilities receive the care treatment and other services necessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential through increased independence productivity and integration into the community the failure of states to properly respond to the definition of developmental disabilities now results in this program being an unfulfilled promise to 1 million individuals and their families it is certainly my hope that this provision will send a strong signal to the states that they should move toward fully serving all of

republicans in 11 different committees of the house have struggled to present a constructive creative comprehensive approach to the biggest problem that faces our domestic economy and that is the trade deficit yes it is a tough bill it is a tough problem that confronts america for 4 years the trade deficit has been growing it has been closing american factories it has been eroding americas industrial base it has been robbing america of jobs it has been exporting jobs and opportunities out of this country to overseas nations it has been eroding the percentage of ownership of americas land and americas banking facilities and americas means of productiontaking these out of the hands of americans and putting them into the hands of foreigners the future if we do not do something is obviously a future that is descriptive of an underdeveloped country where more and more we produce raw products sell them on foreign markets to other countries which turn them into finished goods and then return them for sale on american markets if we needed any single incentive to recognize the desperate straits of americas trade i think all we need to do is to look to the two biggest export commodities out of the biggest port of the united statesthe port of new york what are those two biggest commodities scrap metal and waste paper scrap metal mostly from junked automobiles waste paper sent to other countries and made into cardboard boxes and returned to our shores with television sets and computers and other commodities for sale on the american marketplace and so we have said representing the american people it is time to put a stop to that and this bill does many things yes you can find a lot of things that you do not like in any 946page bill it is not a perfect bill but

and surely they should be willing to pursue the project and to pursue the process until we shall have produced the best from both houses and sent to the president an article that he can sign or not sign but surely let us not stop halfway last year with the aid of about onethird of the republican members we passed a bill essentially similar to this one it had more than enough votes to have overridden the veto in the house if that had been necessary i hope it will not be necessary i hope it will not ever become necessary i believe the president of the united states wants to do something

duncan and mr frenzel that they produced contributions that are embodied in this bill if this were not on balance a bill acceptable to most members if 90 percent and more of its provisions were not broadly acceptable across the board then surely the minority given the option of writing any amendment it wanted would have added more than three changes that is all that were askedonly three changes from this 946page document were requested in the minoritys motion so we come with a bill that enhances our capacity to compete in the world we come with a bill that rewrites the laws on a fair basis

has some appeal drug murders are among the most heinous and wanton crimes perpetrated against our society today the ultimate penalty for the ullmate crime seems logicalon the surface practically however those of you who want to impose the death sentence on drugrelated murders face a classic catch22 situation the constitution forbids the imposition of mandatory death sentences that deny defendants the opportunity to present and the jury to opportunity to weigh mitigating and extenuating circumstances two hundred years of experience with the death penalty in this country have shown that where juries have any discretion they are extremely reluctant to impose a death sentence on their fellow citizens when the death sentence has been the penalty for a crime juries have been willing to let palpably guilty defendants go free or to find them guilty of lesser offenses rather than bearing the burden of imposing the ultimate penalty as long ago as 1853 a member of the alabama house of representatives wrote that if the dealth penalty did not actually allow a criminal to go free it often resulted in a findings of guilty only for a lower grade offense however fully proved may be the higher offense this is because man have more humanity than the society which they establish because as a society they enact laws which in the moment they abrogate in consequence of their inconsistency with the unconquerable feelings of our nature before you cast your votes on the rangel and gekas amendments i urge you to consider which would be a tougher penalty for drugrelated murdera mandatory life sentence which juries would be likely to impose or a death sentence which juries despite all the emotionalism surrounding drugrelated murders would seek to avoid i also urge my colleagues to

1667 and i do rise in strong support of the atmospheric and satellite program authorization i think that one of the most significant aspects of the entire piece of legislation has to do with noaas research program the 1988 budget request that we received provided us with some proposals for the largest decreases actually 23 percent the largest decreases in all federal research and development programs a decrease that i and my committee felt was terribly inappropriate so as a result i rise in very strong support of this particular bill for the global climate change severe weather and ocean research the national science foundation programs have received large increases and i felt it only appropriate that s 1667 allocate funds to restore some of those proposed cuts and to increase noaas global climate and severe weather research program let me just mention a few things about the global climate change program before our science space and technology committee we had scientists testify that increases in greenhouse gases are expected to cause an unprecedented temperature increase of 1 h to 4 2 degrees centigrade and the recommendation was that we take action now in order to take appropriate policy action it is absolutely essential that we have good scientific data on which to base that policy so the increase would as they had predicted change weather patterns that could adversely affect the unitedstates agriculture the breadbasket of the world in addition the predictions were that it could cause sea levels to rise 20 to 80 inches leading to flooding of coastlines people from coastal states like my oceanside state of rhode island and for many other coastal regions recognize the economic impact that could have on our cities and states third the indications and scientific data indicated that it would result in dramatic geographic shifts of entire ecosystems which may cause the extinction of a number of different species of both plants and animals so our solution to the challenge is that s 1667 requires noaas national climate program to undertake studies of both policy options that would reduce the likelihood of human induced global warming trends and second to prepare climate change reports every 5 years so we can more appropriately monitor our access to information and the impact of the changes that are taking place in addition to that the second point i would like to raise is the ozone monitoring amendment that is included in this bill in september 1987 the international ozone agreement that was raised would reduce by 50 percent the 1986 levels in emissions of ozone destroying chemicals by 1999 epa however says that an 80 percent reduction of cfc emissions is really what is needed to have a longterm impact on the stratosphere so the solution that we have proposed in this legislation is to require noaa to submit a plan to construct and operate a worldwide system of ground based remote sensors to monitor atmospheric levels of ozone and chemicals which do destroy the ozone the third particularly important aspect and i believe it to be a significant element of reform which i congratulate the committee for being so creative on is that of user fees noaa can now recover only the cost to reproduce and transmit its archived environmental data and what with the increase of new satellite information and radar information last year the national academy report indicated that the growth of data could completely overwhelm the current system the data that is now held by noaa has doubled since 1984 and it is expected to double again over the next 4 years so the committee on science space and technology has chosen to require noaa to charge user fees for archived data to commercial users based on fair market value and to raise onehalf to 1 million per year when fully phased in as a result i feel that s 1667 is not only fiscally responsible but it is creative in its approach to taking on the challenge of investing in

citizens are compensated in the case of an accident for readiness of understanding let me give examples of the three levels the first level is 160 million or so which the powerplants get from their own insurers the liability insurance group to protect people offsite if they have a disastrous escape of radiation for example the second level is the one that goes up to 7 billion or 8 billion that to me is chernobyl i do not know about the property values in the soviet union system but with the number of people that were killed and wounded by radiation and otherwise probably you would have damages in the 7 billion or 8 billion or 9 billion or 10 billion range because the industry wanted it that way they decided to pick up the tab for the more serious accidents under the plan of charging each working reactor the retrospective premium of 10 million an annual amount of 10 million until they have paid six times and then they would have reached that limit the third layer is the disaster layer let us say the indian point nuclear plant in new york has a meltdown or some very serious matter affecting whole cities and regions we could not decide whether that ought to be 20 billion or 50 billion or 100 billion or what so we decided that third layer will be determined by a commission appointed by the president and given 2 years to come up and say how we should handle claims above the 7 billion or 8 billion obviously you would have to have a large amount of money and it should not be the ratepayers of the nuclear utilities who paid for the first two levels we believe and so wrote the bill that the third level will come from ratepayers everywhere and taxpayers everywhere and the commission will tell us in advance how we ought to finance this and set it up and distribute the

enact welfare reform legislation so far we have proven the skeptics wrong this time is different we have a president who has asked us for welfare reform the house and senate have passed responsible

would impose heavy new burdens on the states and could leave them without adequate resources to carry out those requirements the conferees must strike a balance between the more restrictive senate

was before us in the 99th congress and that is before us today with the added provision but let us try to think about whether we want to have a narrowgauge bill or a widegauge bill the reason we did not include octogenarians who are assaulted is because there was no testimony that suggested that they ought to be as awful as the crimes visited upon them are and the reason we did not account for policemen killed in the line of duty although police organizations do is that there was no request that they be separated out from the uniform crime statistics the crimes of rape are already counted in the uniform crime reports and also crimes are divided by sex what we are saying here is that we really want a narrowgauge bill and it is only because of the incredible testimony about the rising

be removed only for cause second h r 3964 requires the director of the national park service to be knowledgeable in natural and cultural resources third h r 3964 transfers authority for park

primary purpose is to provide the president and the congress with annual independent reports on the national park system and its budgetary needs h r 3964 reaffirms the original principles set forth in the national park organic act of 1916 this act declared unequivocally that the purpose of the national park system is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner 0 0 as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations unfortunately under our current division of authority for our national parks political expediency can override professional judgment this ccurs because the secretary of the interior holds the reins of the national park service although the present administration has demonstrated less concern for conserving the scenery in our national parks than any administration in recent memory the politicization of national park service is institutional and under existing law could reoccur at any time under any administration why because the secretary of the interior is a multihatted administrator he is the chief miner he is the chief oil driller he is the chief grazer he is the chief water developer and in addition to all of this the secretary of the interior is the chief park ranger because the majority of public lands under the secretary of the interior are multiple use conflict is inevitable when the multipleuse manager tries to wear his single purpose hat as chief manager of 80 million acres of the national park system the gentleman from

colleagues to vote yes on h r 3964"], [0.0008009076118469238, 0.5008009076118469, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume h r 4039 is a bill by representative stark of california that addresses the status of certain lands in alameda county ca that were originally granted by the united states for a railroad rightofway the southern pacific railroad which is the successor grantee of the lands involved has acted to abandon use of the lands the tracks have been removed and the railroad has relocated its lines in that area alameda county wants to have the old rightofway included in the countys highway system under california law lands within a county highway rightofway can be used for recreational purposes as well as for other public purposes including transportation under existing law such action by a local government must be preceded by a declaration of abandonment by a court or by congress this bill would provide such a declaration earlier thts session the house approved legislation sponsored by our colleague from maryland mrs byron and many others that dealt with future policy concerning whatever interests the national government may have in such rightsofway upon their abandonment that railstotrails legislation recognized and continued the policy in existing law favoring the ability of local governments to incorporate such rightsofway into public highway systems therefore h r 4039 is not inconsistent with the general policies the house has adopted for disposition of such rightsofway as the one addressed by the bill the interior committee made a number of revisions in the bill in order to accomplish three main purposes first the committee amendments more closely conform the bill to the generic railstotrails legislation that we hope will soon be enacted into law second the committee amendments are intended to assure that the bill cannot be construed as an attempt to resolve any of the issues in ongoing litigation concerning these lands as was brought out at our hearing certain parties claim to be entitled to ownership of these lands under a 1922 act dealing with abandoned rightsofway that claim was denied by a decision of the unitedstates district court but the claimants have appealed that decision to the court of appeals so as to avoid interfering with those judicial proceedings h r 4039 as reported includes explicit language that nothing in the bill is to be construed as expanding or diminishing any right these parties may have in the lands in question if that right vested on or before the date of enactment i believe that this fully protects the position of all parties in the litigation which does not directly involve the united states finally the bill as reported includes language proposed by mr lehman of california that has already passed the house as part of h r 1548 the california military lands withdrawal act but has not been acted on by the senate this would provide for maintaining the status quo at the marine corps mountain warfare training center in the toiyabe national forest and would preclude the forest service from selling or otherwise transferring the affected lands while allowing the marine corps to continue to use them for their training activities this was not controversial when we approved it last year and i know of no controversy about it now i believe that as amended by the interior committee this bill is not controversial it would allow the courts to continue to resolve underlying questions but would put in place policies that could advance the public interest once the courts have made a final ruling i believe the amended bill deserves our support and i urge its approval"]]}
