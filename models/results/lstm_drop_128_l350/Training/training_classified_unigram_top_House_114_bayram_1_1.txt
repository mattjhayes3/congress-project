continues the 5050 blend payment for an additional 3 months it also requires hhs to report to congress on any access issues caused by the blended rate before the full rate change can go into effect the bill also improves access to quality healthcare providers for vulnerable medicaid patients and includes legislation that recently passed the house 4060 in this legislation we again reiterate the houses support to address two important issues that plague medicaid beneficiaries first state medicaid programs too often suffer from waste fraud and abuse and second too many medicaid patients may have a hard time finding a doctor the bill would ensure healthcare providers terminated from medicare or one states medicaid program for reasons of fraud integrity or quality are also terminated from other state medicaid programs the office of inspector general at hhs has previously found that 12 percent of terminated providers were participating in a state medicaid program after the same provider was terminated from another state medicaid program it is critical that fraudulent providers are not allowed to defraud taxpayers or harm patients across the board the bill also requires state medicaid programs to provide beneficiaries served under feeforservice or primary care case management programs an electronic directory of physicians participating in the program this important effort will address a critical challenge of medicaid patients in accessing certain types of care such as obtaining specialty care or dental care medicaid patients would now have better information by simply applying requirements similar to those in place for medicaidmanaged care plans to feeforservice and or primary care case management programs finally the bill includes legislation by mr mchenry and mr butterfield that ensures that payments made under a state eugenics compensation program cannot be considered as income in determining eligibility for any federal public benefit simply put the bill prevents any funds from such a compensation program to be counted as income for purposes of receiving any federal benefits according to the congressional budget office h r 5210 as amended would be

years ago when i was with constituents in my district they were gun dealers and they were complaining and telling me how the administration quietly began requiring the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosiveswe call it the atfto record a firearms purchasers race and ethnicity this is not law it is not congressional action we did not do this the atf through administration rules requires the race of the gun purchaser and the seller who is selling the gun has got to check the box and write the race of the gun purchaser if they do not do that or they do it wrong the atf can come back later look at the records say you left it blank on the race of the individual and shut the business down now there are several problems with this new rule by the atf in order to avoid breaking this federal regulation the dealers then have to ask the customers their race and when people are offendedand they get offendedthey take it out on the dealers themselves sometimes refuse to give their race and then what is the gun seller to do why is our government racial profiling people who exercise the second amendment why are they doing that second it is none of the governments business the race of a gunowner the second amendment does not just apply to certain races it applies to everybody it doesnt exclude races and only include certain races as the gentlewoman from tennessee has said the federal government ought to be colorblind across the board on every issue especially when it comes to rights the second amendment applies to everybody regardless of their race just like the first amendment applies to everybody regardless of their race so this amendment would simply tell the federal government it is none of your business the race of a gun purchaser in the united states stay out of that issue just as equally important you cant shut some business down if they dont put the right race or they leave the race block blank that is none of the federal
