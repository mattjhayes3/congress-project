issues of crony capitalism a corrupt court system and a massive bureaucracy but having said that i think it is important to note that weve seen action taken here in the house foreign affairs committee

according to most reports is that he was beaten to death well what does this legislation do something again vladimir putin would be virulently opposed to it actually penalizes anyone who was involved in those human rights violations against sergei magnitsky so this is a good thing and at the same time in passing pntr we will say that the 140 million consumers in russia will have access to goods

down in american history under presidents reagan and bush the debt held by the public quadrupled by the time bill clinton left office the budget was on track to pay off the entire publicly held debt on a net basis by 2009 remember alan greenspan warned us that we were paying down the debt too quickly the clock in times square which chronicled the deficit was actually turned off at the end of the clinton years but unfortunately there were those who thought that we should shift course economic growth averaged 4 percent during those clinton years compared to an average of 2 8 percent during president reagans years the economy grew for 116 consecutive months the most in history fueled by more than 22 5 million jobs that were created during those 8 years the most jobs ever created during a single administration and more than were created in the previous 12 years on january 20 2001 when george w bush took the oath of office the cbo estimated that the total budget surplus for 2002 to 2011 would be 5 6 trillion and their campaign began to spend that surplus in earnest despite warnings president bush began taking us down that fiscal path by enacting tax cuts first in 2001 of 1 3 trillion and again in 2003 1 trillion that cost the government going forward almost 4 trillion the other major expenditure in those years was our idea that you could simultaneously engage two wars and cut taxes by 2 3 trillion remember the argument about weapons of mass destruction that took us to the unnecessary war in iraq while some question tax cuts in wartime including people like mr lincoln others thought it brilliant the republican leader at the time or the deputy leader at the time said it was patriotic to cut taxes in a time of war well i wonder if the 2 2 million more veterans who have served us with honor and distinction in iraq and afghanistan are going to feel that way when proposals come down the road to draw back on the benefits that theyve earned during the bush years our country spent 1 5 trillion in iraq and on national defense the turnaround in our budget picture during the bush years was remarkable in october of 2008 cnn reported that the debt clock had run out of numbers the debt clock actually had exceeded 13 digits that had been allotted so the clock had to be revised according to one report at the end of the bush term the number of jobs in the nation increased by 2 percent thats the lowest or most tepid growth at any time since data began to be collected seven decades ago gross domestic product was at the lowest pace for a period of that length of time since the truman administration and the price that america has paid for the theology that suggested during all of those years that tax cuts paid for themselves you cant find a mainstream economist in this town today who will acknowledge that argument and yet we hear now more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans by the time that the bush years ended the debt had increased to 10 6 trillion setting a record for any administration and incidentally the tarp vote that we hear so often that took place in october of 2008 thats a very important consideration that was during president

welcomed he reminded us of all that was great about americaa place where people have for generations come here in search of a better life often fleeing from oppression persecution and deprivation when america was faced with a growing wave of undocumented immigrants 25 years ago he proposed common sense solutions to fixing the problem he never demonized illegal immigrants he never belittled them never used them as a scapegoat and never blamed them for the nations troubles he never inflamed public opinion and saw the good in people his former speechwriter peter robinson once said he could picturein his own minds eye he could picture those little ships that the pilgrims sailed in he could picture the difficult oppressive conditions under which the chinese were brought to california he admired people for what they had gone through to achieve better lives for themselves and their families in this country he even felt compassion and empathy for those who had come here illegally at the signing ceremony for the immigration reform and control act of 1986 president reagan said the legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now

sorely needed it would invest in conservation programs it would invest in environmental restoration projects it would invest so importantly in renewable energy research and development so that once again we can regain the lead around the world it would invest in clean energy technology as well as increasing development of existing as well as traditional energy sources like improving our

code or appliance standard or home retrofit we should be doing far more in this area in fact a recent international energy agency analysis found that without new policies twothirds of the costeffective energy efficiency gains that could be made will remain unrealized through this bill includes a number of noncontroversial technical fixes to appliance energy efficiency standards for water heaters walkin freezers deli counterstyle refrigerators and certain types of air conditioners the bill includes improvements to the process by which the department of energy updates its energy efficiency standards in addition there are a few sensible provisions to promote industrial energy efficiency and the efficiency of federal government buildings this bill will not produce large energy savings but its a worthwhile package of consensus improvements the package is based on provisions that recently passed the senate by unanimous consent both industry and energy efficiency advocates support the bill this is a bill that has a very good chance of becoming law this month but we need to do much much more the beginning of a new congress provides us an opportunity to work together on a bipartisan basis to enact commonsense energy efficiency legislation such legislation will save consumers money boost domestic manufacturing while cutting pollution including the carbon pollution that is driving dangerous climate change i look forward to starting those discussions with chairman upton and our energy and commerce committee colleagues there are many good ideas for policies that would reduce waste and save energy and we should work together to explore those ideas and enact the ones we can agree on todays bill is a first step i encourage my colleagues to support it and i reserve the

food came in and because it kills people when that happens i urge my colleagues to support the amendment until we can get ourselves in a situation where we have proper and adequate funding for food

class in our country and his work to ensure that we would have this payroll tax cut as well as the extension of unemployment insurance that he fought so hard on as well as on making sure that our seniors are able to see their doctors under medicare congratulations and thank you mr levin i rise today in support of this legislation of course i identify with the concerns expressed by our distinguished whip mr hoyer and of mr van hollen regarding our public employees before i talk directly about what is in the bill i do want to say that for our country to thrive and for us to do our very best we must have a great relationship between the public and the private sector the private sector is the driving engine of job creation in our country but it cannot succeed unless we also have an effective and thriving public sector its about so many things that relate to our public safety the courts the implementation of laws passed in congress they dont exist unless the public sector then implements them so this is a symbiotic relationship that has existed from the beginning of time in our country its not a zero sum game we cannot say were going to do this in the private sector at the expense of the public sector so i salute them for their persistent leadership and recognizing the important role that the public sector plays it was not necessary for us to go down the path that has been taken in this bill and ill get to that in a moment first i want to say that this represents a victory for the middle class in our country and i salute president obama for going out there so strongly and taking this message to the american people that it was very important for us to have a payroll tax cut for the middle class its important to those families because it puts 40 more into a paycheck to buy groceries to buy gasoline and to make ends meetto make ends meet in addition to being personally helpful to families it has a macroeconomic effect because these families will immediately spend that money and inject demand into the economy and that is a job creator any economist will tell you that this is very important to continuing the economic recovery in our country to have rejected it as had been in the mix earlier would have halted if not turned back our economic recovery so let us recognize that we had three pillars that we insisted be in this package we on the democratic side one that we would have a payroll tax cut for 160 million americans preferably unpaid for and that is the way it is in this bill what is unfortunate is that we did not use our choice of a payfor should it be paid for the surcharge to cover the unemployment insurance that would have been a preferable place to go the extension of unemployment insurance it could have also been used to pay for the sgr the ability for seniors to see their doctors instead of taking money out of the prevention piece of the affordable care act prevention makes america healthier it saves money and it expands opportunity for people to get in the health care loop thats unfortunate and it could have been avoided as well as the unfortunate provision relating to our public employees even on that score mr hoyer said as mr van hollen did there was a further compromise that could have been made that addressed some of the needs of the republicans to vote for this bill without doing more harm to as mr hoyer said the recruitment and the retention of public employees the bestthe bestpublic employees to help implement our laws and i want to salute all of them for their patriotic duty to our country to make and keep us safe in every possible way and to allow commerce to proceed in a very positive way now lets get back to why this is important this victory for the middle class this was a fight why should it have been a fight theres something out there in the public the ground truth the common sense coming up from the ground that this was an important thing to do and the american people overwhelmingly supported it theres a ground truth out there from the public common sense coming up from the ground that in order for us meet our needs and also reduce the deficit that we should have a surcharge on the wealthiest people in our country people making over 1 million a yearnot having a million dollarsmaking over 1 million a year that was not contained in this bill but it will be part of the debate as we go forward so lets take a moment to say that we recognize here on this floor of the house the importance of a thriving middle class to our democracyto our democracyand that this action taken today is an important step but we have much more work to do democrats are committed to reigniting the american dream to building ladders of opportunity for all who want to work hard play by the rules and take responsibility but we have work to do in this thrivingthis reignitingamerican dream its about recognizing the role of entrepreneurialism in our system of small businesses and what they do to grow our economy and how we have a publicprivate relationship there to encourage small business and also again all of this relates to a thriving middle class so i urge my colleagues to be evervigilant about every opportunity we can take to support the middle class today is a good day in that regard its just one piece of it though we have much more work to do in any bill that comes up there are things you may not like in it and you say well im not going to vote for it for that reason on balance i come down in favor of supporting what the president asked us to do which we did do and what the american people want us to do but i dont want to go forward without registering the concern that we could have done better in this one place we can start on our next legislation is to look at the surcharge for the wealthiest people in america instead of taking billions of dollars from preventive care so that we can offset the cost in here none of it needed to be offset the payroll tax cut has not been unemployment insurance has not traditionally been paid for and we didnt have to do it now in fact paying for it diminishes some of its stimulative effect because economists will tell you unemployment insurance benefits paid out are immediately spent back into the treasury as the payroll tax cut will be too and stimulates the economy by injecting demand and creating more jobs sgr we should have gone all the way with it we should have done it permanently we could have paid for it with our war savings or with a surcharge at the high end republicans said no having said all of that the fact that we are here today is an admission that this is the right thing to do in terms of the payroll tax cut and unemployment compensation and our seniors its a recognition that the american people are watching and they have little appetite for us to be fighting over what they know is the right thing to do which is to take every action we can to grow our economy focusing on the middle class small business entrepreneurial spirit and the rest again we have important work to do to reignite the american dream in even bigger ways so with that i urge our colleagues to support the
