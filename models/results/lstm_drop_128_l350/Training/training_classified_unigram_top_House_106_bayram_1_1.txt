newborns we all know of cases where newborns have been killed or left to die there was a piece done by the philadelphia inquirer the pulitzer prize winning newspaper called the dreaded complication it talked about live births that resulted from failed or botched abortion attempts dr willard cates is quoted extensively in that report he was at the time the chief of abortion surveillance for the cdc he made the point that reporting that failed abortions resulted in live births is like turning yourself into the irs for an audit what is there to gain the article talks about repeatedly case after case where abortionists tried to kill an unborn child failed to do so only to have someone else step into the gap scoop up that child and bring that child to some kind of life saving situation the report notes that the common thread in all of the incidents and they go through one instance after another is that it was not the doctor but someone else who intervened to administer care to the child notwithstanding three decades of distraction distortion and deceit by the abortion lobby i am happy to say a majority of americans believe and according to a recent nationwide l a times poll 61 percent of all american women regard abortion as murder the violence of abortion should be selfevident chemical poisoning dismemberment brain sucking procedures but the bill of the gentleman from florida seeks to protect newborns kids that are already born they too are now at risk under this slippery slope if one looks and reads the supreme court decision on partial birth abortion it should be

positive effect in particular on middle and lower income married couples at the outset this member would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the house ways and means committee from texas for introducing this legislation it is important to note that h r 4810 has the same provisions as h r 6 which passed on the floor of the house on february 10 2000 by a vote of 268158 with this mem bers support however the senate has been unable to reach the 60 vote threshold on a cloture vote to close debate on marriage penalty legislation as a result the house is now considering the marriage tax penalty as the first reconciliation bill a status which will allow debate and amendments to be limited in the senate while there are many reasons to support h r 4810 this member will enumerate two specific reasons first h r 4810 takes a significant step toward eliminating the current marriage penalty in the internal revenue code second h r 4810 follows the principle that the federal income tax

nonitemizers if one does not itemize their taxes they benefit from the standard deduction we double that if one does itemize their taxes they benefit from the widening of 15 percent tax bracket the

conclusion at some point we are going to have to make some adjustments we are going to have to do an acrosstheboard cut or we are going to have to do whatever it takes to make certain that we live

districts in america i represent the south side of chicago and the south suburbs in cook and will counties industrial communities like joliet bedroom communities like morris and new lennox farm towns like tonica and mazon i hear one common message as i travel throughout this very diverse district and listen to the concerns of the people i have the privilege of representing that message is fairly simple that is the american people want us to work together they want us to come up with solutions to the challenges that we face when i was elected in 1994 i was elected with that message of finding solutions and finding ways to change how washington works to make washington more responsive to the folks back home we were elected of course to bring those solutions to the challenges of balancing the budget and raising takehome pay by lowering taxes and reforming welfare and taming the irs but there were a lot of folks here in washington who said you know those are challenges that you will never solve that you will never be able to do that and they said it just could not be done and i am proud to say tonight that we did we did do what we were told we could not do i am proud that our accomplishments include the first balanced budget in 28 years the first middle class tax cut in 16 years the first real welfare reform in a generation and the first ever reform of the irs our efforts produced a balanced budget that has now generated a projected surplus of extra tax revenue of 2 3 trillion over the next 10 years we now have a 500 per child tax credit that is going to benefit 3 million children in my state of illinois welfare reform that has succeeded in reducing welfare rolls by 25 percent and taxpayers now enjoy the same rights with the irs that they have in a courtroom for the first time taxpayers are innocent until proven guilty these are real accomplishments of this congress and i am proud to have been part of those accomplishments but we also have greater challenges ahead of us because this congress held the presidents feet to the fire we balanced the budget and now we are collecting more in taxes than we are spending something new here in washington and the question before this house and this congress in washington is what do we do with that extra tax revenue 2 3 trillion an extra tax revenue we are collecting more than we are spending i think it is pretty clear there was an agreement a bipartisan agreement that the first priority for this extra tax revenue is to save social security to make sure that we keep social security on sound footing for our seniors and future generations and i do want to note that last fall the republican house passed and sent to the senate legislation that would earmark 90 percent of the surplus of extra tax revenue for saving social security now this year president clinton says he only needs 62 percent we can save social security with 62 percent well we agreed that at a minimum we should setaside 62 percent of surplus tax revenues for saving social security of course the question is what do we do with the rest bill clinton says that we should save social security and then spend the rest the remaining 38 percent of surplus tax revenues on new government programs on big government i disagree and say that we should save social security and we should raise takehome pay by lowering taxes the question is pretty simple before this house whose money is it to start with you know if you think about it if you go to a restaurant and you buy a meal and you find that you overpay the restaurant will usually say wait a second you have given us too much you should take this back you have paid too much and that extra money they should get back to you well it is clear today that this government is collecting too much and it is time to give that too much back in a tax cut there is a pretty simple question again it is do we want to save social security and spend the rest of the surplus tax revenue or do we save social security and give it back for working families give it back by eliminating the marriage tax penalty and rewarding retirement savings you know the tax foundation tells us that todays tax burden is too high the average family in illinois sends 40 percent of its annual income its earnings its salary to government at local state and federal levels forty percent of your income goes to government at one level or another and i also want to note that the irs tells us that since bill clinton was elected president in 1992 taxes collected by the federal government from individuals and from families have gone up 63 percent the tax burden on americas families is the highest ever my colleagues we can save social security we can eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us

to hold this public discussion of the individuals with disabilities education act many people at home know it as idea i must say that when i talk to teachers back home and school superintendents back home this is one of the greatest topics of concern in many cases many of the younger newer teachers think all of a sudden in the last few years we invented idea which is not the case of course it was passed in 1975 when we took the republicans took control of congress we tried to deal with some of the discipline problems just 2 years ago that are occurring in idea so this is sort of new news to youngsters who are just out of college and just started teaching let me begin by stating that i doubt that there can be a more important job in america than teaching our children i do not know what it would be this is especially true of our special education teachers education for those with disabilities allows all of our children to have the opportunity to learn and succeed ensuring that all of our children have a safe and orderly environment in which to learn must be and is a top priority most every teacher i have talked to about idea brings up the problem of classroom discipline teachers tell me that there is a great double standard that exists when disciplining disabled students for instance a nondisabled student who brings a gun to school can face a much stronger disciplinary action than a disabled child who engages in that very same activity we need to make sure that our teachers and students are protected in the classroom while at the same time ensuring that disabled students are fairly treated this is critical if we are going to make sure that our children disabled and nondisabled have a good learning environment a good order at their schools learning will soon become a casualty if it has not already if we do not do this and soon enough our children will become economic casualtie6 if they do not learn well i believe that we should trust our teachers to determine who should be in the classroom they will know firsthand which students are discipline problems and which students are just having a hard time reading up to their grade level they will know how to deal compassionately with those students with disabilities who because of their disability may be disrupting the classroom experience of others we can and should provide a good education for all without putting our teachers in this untenable position in addition i want to speak a minute about this unfunded mandate that the gentleman from pennsylvania was talking about we have since 1975 mandated to our states that they do certain things at the school districts the same law that mandated what our special education teachers have to do said we the federal government will fund that we will pick up 40 percent of the tab you at home pick up 60 percent of the tab that simply has not been the case it has been only under the gentlemans leadership over the last 4 years that we have finally gotten the funding level up to 12 percent that is a long long way from 40 percent now what does that mean that means people at home who are paying property taxes that go to their schools who want to use that money to add new teachers do not have it because they are funding special education if we want to use that money for bricks and mortars which we should do at home to build new schools we do not have it because it is going to special education and the federal government is just simply not keeping its word and i will yield back after making one point my great state of georgia for example is a perfectly good example we received almost 54 million as part of this mandated special education money but had we received what the law required it would have been over 276 million we received 54 million by law we should have received 276 million we can fix a lot of roofs in georgia and we can hire a whole lot of teachers back in georgia if the federal government will do what you are trying to

my time and thank the gentleman from tennessee for his leadership in helping families he has been a tireless advocate in making the tax code fair that is what it is all about our goal is to make the tax code fair for working families those who work hard pay their bills on time and pay their taxes on time they all tell me they pay too much in taxes but they complain even more about how unfair the tax code is that it is too complicated and that our tax code punishes marriage it punishes family it punishes those who are entrepreneurs and create small businesses clearly a decision has been made by our leadership under the leadership of our house speaker the gentleman from illinois that we are going to do something that is a good idea we are going to send to the president a standalone bill that does one thing so there are no excuses there are no excuses for bill clinton to veto this bill this time and that is we are going to send to the president legislation that will help 25 million married working couples by bringing fairness to the tax code that wipes out the marriage tax penalty the proposal we will vote on tomorrow does several things it helps those who do not itemize by doubling the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that of singles and that will take care of about 9 million couples we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who itemize their taxes and as we all know the primary reason middleclass families itemize their taxes is because they own a home so if we want to help those other couples and we are going to help 25 million couples we have to help those who itemize those who own a home and pursue the american dream they should not have to continue paying the marriage tax penalty just because they are a homeowner that is wrong we also help those who participate in the earned income credit the working poor those who are at the edge that need a little extra help of course ronald reagan created the earned income credit program back in the mid1980s to help families that are working poor and of course want to be in the work force and be able to support their children and raise their families in a good quality of life so we wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples we help those who itemize and suffer the marriage tax penalty and we help lowincome families and under our proposal according to the joint committee on taxation the biggest beneficiaries are those with incomes between 30 000 and 75 000 in fact for a couple making 30 000 in combined income 97 percent of their federal income tax is wiped out when we wipe out their marriage tax penalty for those making 75 000 we reduce their tax burden by about 11 percent when we wipe out their marriage tax penalty i think of young couples like michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers in joliet illinois who suffer the marriage tax penalty they both teach in joliet public schools they just had a baby and they are excited about that and as michelle told me she says if we can convince the congress and the president to wipe out the marriage tax penalty what the marriage tax penalty means to couples like michelle and shad hallihan is about 3 000 diapers for their newborn child the marriage tax penalty is real money for real people it is 1 400 on average twentyfive million married working couples suffer the unfairness of the tax code when they pay 1 400 more in higher taxes in the south suburbs of illinois on the south side of chicago the area i have the privilege of representing 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet junior college the local community college it is 3 months of day care it is several months of car payments 1 400 the average working tax penalty is a significant contribution to an individuals retirement account those iras it is real money for real people tomorrow h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act will be brought to the floor of this house to be debated my hope is it will pass with an overwhelming bipartisan majority it is all about fairness bringing fairness to the tax code my hope is democrats will join with republicans in wiping out the marriage tax penalty i am pleased that

the republican tax bill which basically came out of the committee on rules that there are some democratic principles that we can support the truth of the matter is one does not have to be an accountant or h r block or a tax lawyer to see that the 120 billion tax cut is not for the small business person so take a look at it clearly it is targeted for the wealthiest americans that we have now it may not be bad to do that but do not pile up on a bill that is just trying to give a dollar extra in terms of minimum wage if these things want to be done come out and let the committee on ways and means have hearings vote on it and bring it to the floor so that the floor can work its will what my colleagues are basically doing today is to say how can we kill the minimum wage bill now the gentleman from california the chairman of the committee on rules he stood up in this well and he said he thought it was bad to superimposge congressional rule on employers and i know a lot of my colleagues think that is true so why not just take the minimum wage bill leave the tax portion to the committee on ways and means and vote up or down on what is right on minimum wage or do it their way and say hey the president is inclined to support minimum wage maybe politically we can vote for it and have the president to veto it now how can one get the president to veto it load it up with provisions of the tax bill that passed last year because he would veto it now it just seems to me that if my colleagues on the other side did not have the political courage to get a vote to override the presidents veto we should not do on legislation for minimum wage what the committee on ways and means and what this house is not prepared to do with a straight shot everything that the people want is going to be taken whether it is the patients bill of rights affordable drugs and it is going to be said that my colleagues on the other side are for these things and then add on to it substantial tax cuts that is not for the working people but for those who really have the highest earnings and deserve the benefits the least if one takes a look at the alternative that we asked for many of the things h844 coi that are in their bill we have but what we do is close the loopholes of americans that after enjoying the benefits of the great prosperity that we have renounce their citizenship renounce their country renounce the american flag and flee off to foreign countries for crying out loud why would anyone be opposed to closing up that loophole it is in our alternative we then will target the tax money not 122 billion but 36 billion to the small farmers the small businesspeople and this is what they want and this is what the president is willing to sign we have targeted relief for people that need and deserve it so if what my colleagues on the other side are trying to say is that they are for an increase in the minimum wage but they want to help the small businessman how do they explain that threefourths of the bill in terms of tax cuts is not going to the small businessman not going to the small farmer is this their way to kill a bill by having the president to veto it and then wait until their whole legislative process collapses and then we negotiate with the president we should not have to negotiate with any president we should legislate and we should also give the minority an opportunity to express its will what does that mean why would the rule deny us an opportunity just for an alternative just to give republicans and democrats an opportunity to say that we have a better way to do it well we know one thing that what is really trying to be done is to get that 800 pound billion dollar gorilla back up here to the tax floor in smaller pieces it did not work last year it was vetoed last year an override for the veto last year was not run for and an override this year is not being thought about to try for there are things that we should be working

including in this bill for the social security administrations ssa administrative expenses this bill reduces the presidents request by 156 million compared to the commissioners request this is a reduction of 378 million these reductions will force ssa to reduce staff at the same time that the ssa is facing its own wave of retirements from its own employees in the next five to ten years as well the reductions will also result in decreased service to individuals with disabilities and the nations seniors and reduced oversight of the integrity of the agencys programs i fear that these reductions will put a strain on the agencys ability to carry out its mission i believe that the ssa faces these funding shortfalls because it is subject to the allocation required by the spending caps even though social security benefit payments are considered offbudget and not subject to spending cap restrictions since we are not able to fund the ssa properly we should take social securitys administrative expenses out of the caps we could fund the agency based on the size and scope of its programssubject to the approval of the committee on appropriations but not subject to the section 302 allocationrather than what we are able to find without our allocation even though most of the administrative funding for ssa is derived from the trust fundsfunds that cannot be used for any other

crime rate under mandatory minimums is not affected several studies have concluded that the rand study for example showed that mandatory minimums essentially wasted the taxpayers money because there were much more effective ways of reducing crimes than mandatory minimums the mandatory minimums associated with project exile show no better results the proponents suggest that the violent crime rate has gone down 39 percent in the city of richmond under project exile at the same time it went down 43 percent in norfolk 58 percent in virginia beach and 81 percent in chesapeake without project exile even if project exile had some value this bill is simply inadequate according to the sponsprs only six states would qualify for funding under the bill and even if 10 states qualified the funding is only for 10 million on average per state and simple math at 25 000 per year per incarceration would reflect that each state could only incarcerate about five additional defendants per year in the city of richmond we have over 3 000 people in jail today and incarcerating a handful more certainly is not a serious attempt to reduce the overall crime rate in the commonwealth of virginia or across our nation accordingly i oppose the use of this costly unfair ineffective mandatory minimum sentence if we are going to be serious about doing anything about crime we should take the common sense approach recommended by the bipartisan task force on juvenile crime which encourages us to use funds for prevention and early intervention programs that have been proven to reduce crime and we should ignore the rhymes and slogans which are ineffective and waste the taxpayers money we can start doing that by voting against this bill i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.799121081829071,

seriously stood up to george wallace in this state and i paid for it i paid in dollars cashing in my pension fund to help finance that campaign and watching debt follow debt in years to come i paid in

bill continues to have a number of good things in fact even some better things as a result of bringing it to the floor this second time there are three additional million dollars for the southwest waterfront that were not here additional funding to the cja attorneys for the local courts so they can be paid for representing poor people in the district we have money for the d c scholarship act

marijuana under this and it is something that frankly outside of the appropriations process i cannot believe congress would approve if my county passed it i know the commonwealth of virginia would not

to support this legislation that seeks to address the issue of child abuse and prevent it and treat it it is a terrible problem in our society more than anything i want the house and the speaker to understand the value of communitybased child abuse prevention efforts like that which exists in my hometown of spokane washington in the mid1980s a group of us decided that in order to address this growing problem something needed to be done to have a safe place for children who are potentially abused children to go until their parents or guardians or custodians could have a chance to get the variable social services that might be available whether it is job loss advice or alcohol abuse advice or other assistance so we started a group called the vanessa behan crisis nursery it is a nonprofit charitable organization that exists today without any government funds it is all community supported and assisted from labor unions to community leaders to business leaders to social service assistance to junior league of spokane and many many others who have banded together to contribute clothing have bought a house and converted it through the assistance of contractors and labor union tradesmen and made this house a home for children who are potentially abused children to this day they do not take any state or federal money so my point to the speaker and the house is that it can be done outside of the auspices of government but there is also a challenge that the vanessa behan crisis nursery has and its wonderful director sue manford in trying to have phase two of the crisis nursery be constructed terribly expensive terribly difficult to get more money to try to assist in this program but it is a valuable program my hope would be that as we discuss the issue of child abuse and child abuse prevention that we think about the nonprofit charity i believe communitybased and supported operations that can go such a long way to helping solve this problem of child abuse and protection of children without the bureaucracy and the strings that are attached many many times to government money so i would hope that my colleagues the gentleman from florida and the gentlewoman from texas and others the gentlewoman from ohio especially would think carefully about making money available to communitybased organizations for proper purposes and with accountability but without so many strings attached and so much federal or state control over what happens to the money once it gets there accountability is a good thing it has to be but at least the crisis nursery thus far has rejected federal funds application or state funds application for just that reason it is burdensome and creates more problems sometimes than it is worth but i really think that the model that is established through the vanessa behan crisis nursery in spokane i think it is the only one in our entire state that has addressed this issue of child abuse prevention it is a safe haven respite care facility for kids young children who are the subject of abuse or potential abuse but it may be temporary it is an opportunity for the parents of these kids or the custodians or guardians to get out and get some social services help which i think probably will be help in this bill as well so i commend my colleagues to this model to the great success of the crisis nursery in spokane washington and i suggest that those who may be interested in this look to the crisis nursery as an example of what can be done in a nongovernmental charitable communitybased organizational way with that i will support this bill and i thank the gentleman from florida and others who work so hard to make this concept of child abuse a prominent one and prevent the child abuse that exists so much in

twice this year with strong bipartisan support in fact it is even better than the version we had earlier because we have accelerated the tax relief to married couples so that they can get tax relief from the marriage penalty burden in the year 2000 this year the doubling of the standard deduction and the doubling of the 15 percent income tax bracket the expansion of the earned income tax credit limits those will all be effective retroactive to january of this year that means if president clinton signs this bill millions of couples will be helped next year during tax time mr speiker i think this bill is fiscally responsible because it is less than onehalf of 1 percent of the 2 2 trillion nonsocial security surplus less than onehalf of 1 percent second it gives the most help to those

invite my colleagues to join in cosponsoring this legislation federal employees play vital roles in ensuring that the many important services offered by the federal government are provided to citizens of the united states when they are needed all too often instead of being rewarded for their work on behalf of all americans federal employees find themselves facing many arbitrary barriers restricting their ability to enjoy many of the privileges that other americans enjoy in a recent column in the washington post mike causey pointed out the unfair situation under current law prohibiting federal employees from saving for their retirement in the same manner as private sector employees with 401 k plans to address this and other inequities affecting federal employees retirement savings i have introduced h r 483 the federal thrift savings plan enhancement act this legislation will provide federal employees with tools essential to ensure that the thrift savings plan meets their retirement needs the bill will allow employees to invest up to the irs limit of 10 000 to the thrift savings plan without changing the government contribution currently fers employees can put up to 10 percent of their salary into their tsp accounts csrs employees can only invest up to 5 percent of their salary into these accounts this arbitrary percentage limitation works to the clear detriment of federal employees for instance a fers employee at a gs10 level earning 35 498 per year may only contribute 10 percent or 3 550 annually into his or her tsp account however someone in the private sector earning the same amount may contribute as much as 10 000 annually into his or her 401 k account which is 6 450 more than the similarly situated federal employee may invest my legislation is a sensible way to encourage federal employees to increase their savings for retirement at a time when we are encouraging americans of all age to save and invest more for their retirements it is absolutely inequitable to arbitrarily restrict the ability of these employees to invest in their retirements in the same manner as private sector employees with 401 k plans in addition to remedying this inequity my bill will eliminate all waiting periods for employee contributions to the tsp for new hires and rehires making these employees eligible to contribute their own funds to the tsp immediately president clinton declared during his state of the union address that we must help all americans from their first day on the job to save to invest to create wealth well this bill will enable federal employees to do just that to begin investing for their retirement from day one finally this legislation ensures the portability of retirement savings by authorizing employees to roll in money from a private sector 401 k to their tsp accounts that really does make sense doing this gives employees entering the federal work force the ability to continue managing their retirement account and maximize the wealth that these accounts create america has one of the lowest savings rates among industrialized countries it has fallen steadily over the last 20 years seriously jeopardizing americans security during what should be their golden years while americans recognize they should be saving more half of all family heads in their late 50s possess less than 10 000 in net financial assets with the retirement of americas baby boomers approaching congress must encourage americans to save more and this legislation is an important tool in empowering federal employees to do precisely that i also want to point out that i am also working on child care needs critically important i have introduced h r 206 the federal employee child care affordability act it is a bipartisan bill it will allow federal agencies to use their salary and expense accounts to help executive agency employees pay for child care surprisingly enough under current law they cannot do that so they need the authorization which would come from this bill and the federal agencies want it this bill developed with the help of opm would allow agencies to pay a portion of the providers operating costs thus enabling child care centers to reduce the fees charged to lower income federal employees and frankly it does not require any additional appropriations i do hope that all of my colleagues will join in cosponsoring
