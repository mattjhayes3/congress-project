in reaching in agreement authorizing 299 6 billion for defense consistiint with last novembers budget summit agreement and the fiscal year 1989 budget resolution i am particularly grateful for the excellent work of the distinguished chairperson or the military personnel and compensation subcommittee mrs byron for her leadership in shepherding legislalion i introduced earlier this year h r 3975 which directs the secretary of defense to establish a permanent rental housing program involving military personnel and their civilian landlords this program will remove perhaps the largest financial burden on our military families this legislation will make permanent the pilot program which has been in effect at fort ord over the last 15 months the program has been implemented with a high degree of success resulting in the solution of problems with military residents with respect to payment and landlords obtaining guarantees on security deposit payments although the senate defense authorization measure did not contain a similar provision h r 4264s housing lease indemnity program was adopted by the senate with two amendments i support both amendments the first amendment clarifies the due process provlsions of the program regarding each participating service members obligation before reducing that members pay for breach of the lease or damage to the rental unit and the other amendment outlines the extension of this program to our service members overseas i would like to take a few minutes to describe what this legislation will do first of all it authorizes the secretary of defense to make the program permanent each military service would then have the option of whether and at which inst llations to institute participation in this program in the united states second civilian landlords who rent to military personnel would agree to waive security deposits when renting housing units to military personnel for the guarantee of rental deposit security from the military in return the military post would agree that if for any reason the service member leaves without making final payments for rent or damage the post would make such final payments these payments could not exceed the amount of an ordinarily required security deposit any outlays of the military post would then be deducted from the service members paycheck for example a service member wants to rent an apartment for 500 per month under this legislation the landlord would agree to accept only a first months rent without any required security deposit or last months rent right away we are saving the service member up to 1 000 if the service member if transferred to another post or is assigned to onpost housing and leaves his apartment without paying his last months rent the post to which he is assigned would meet the last months rent payment of 500 this 500 would then be deducted from the service members paycheck all of my colleagues are aware of the tremendous financial and emotional pressures inflicted on our military personnel and their families this already tense situation is made even worse during a permanent change of station move travel and relocation expenses come out of the pockets of our servicemen and women reimbursement comes later although in the past only 1 out of 4 spent on a pcs move has been reimbursed according to an air force study and when the military families arrive in a new location they must meet the immediate costs of security deposits first and last months rent utility deposits and more before you can even blink a military family can be thousands of dollars in debt and 2 years later the entire process is repeated it is important to note that no appropriation of funds is necessary because the service member would be ultimately responsible for meeting the costs of any damage or breach of lease i know that the landlords on the monterey peninsula have benefited from the pilot program the favorable comments from the civilian landlords show that the vacancy rate has dropped considerably in their particular apartment complexes since participating in the program also a housing referral office representative available when requested during moveout inspections provided the verification necessary to resolve any disputes or misunderstandings that arose at that time they realize the hardships imposed on the military family and they understand the progam guarantees payment for damages and breach of lease up to the amount of the usual security deposit this program gives landlords one point of contact for all their military tenants and a source of information regarding military personnel who may soon be transferred thus enabling landlords to prepare for a change in the lease soldiers have been very happy with the program because without it they could not afford a place to live and would therefore be forced to live apart from their families until onpost housing became available the program has also kept soldiers from getting into serious financial difficulties which is often associated with a pcs move this program should solve one of the major problems facing our military personnel and do away with certainly one of their largest financial burdens what is more no one loses in this program everyone wins landlords are guaranteed payment our military personnel are able to use their hardearned dollars for necessities and the services are guaranteed reimbursement for any outlays to landlords when the house voted in the 99th congress to accept many proposals to ease the burdens on our military personnel servicemen and women all over the world breathed a sigh of relief now this legislation will resolve one of the most pressing and financially disabling issues by making permanent this highly successful pilot program permanent so that one day our military men and women will not look on military service as a financially crippling experience again i want to thank the conferees for their excellent work on reaching this conference agreement and express my appreciatiort to subcommittee chairperson byron for her excellent work in implementing this legislation"],

aid to the contras i think that it is useful in reviewing this proposal to put it to two tests the first test is does the policy work on the ground in nicaragua and is it likely to succeed this is a military action by soldiers that we are supporting and i think that as we think about whether or not they could militarily succeed putting aside the cia reports and even our own defense reports that say they are unlikely to overthrow the sandinistas it is important to review a little history of our involvement in nicaragua the united states has invaded nicaragua 12 times in history if you go the 1920s and 1930s it sounds an awful lot like the congressional record of today and if you look at the old newspapers from those periods you will see that the headlines remind you of the headlines of today so to the people of nicaragua the people that were involved in those times this is nothing new 1 1700 i think a second fact we must recognize is that in the late 1970s when this country underwent a revolution 50 000 nicaraguans lost their lives this is a country of about 3 3 million and if we remember in the vietnam conflict we lost about 50 000 people on almost any day you can drive by the vietnam memorial here and get a sense of what that conflict and that loss of life meant in this country so we can imagine what that meant in nicaragua when we begin thinking about whether or not a military solution to the problem is something that can work on the ground in nicaragua so i simply submit on the basis of that anecdotal evidence and the evidence we see from our own military and our own central intelligence agency that having a military policy and a military solution to our problems is not likely to succeed i think the next thing we should look at is this does the policy reach the goals and the vital interests of the united states on this point i think there has been some confusion because we have many different goals that are enunciated by the administration i think we should try to better articulate what our goals are i think there are two i think we have two vital interests in nicaragua the first is to reduce the foreign military influences in that country certainly soviet cuban libyan whatever foreign military influence is in this country and the second is to keep the sandinistas from interfering with their neighbors with many of whom we have treaties and obligations if we put this policy against that testwhat are our goals and are we reaching them i think members would agree with me that we are not previous speakers on the other side have said that we just cannot negotiate with communists certainly there are people in our country who have that view i do not think the president has that view if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with mikhail gorbachev and the soviet union if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with the chinese on a variety of subjects and i believe that the president has even said that the contras are in the field in order to put pressure on the sandinistas so that we can get to negotiations to resolve and reconcile our vital interests if that is our goal then what are the people in the region who are leading the effort and working to make this effort come about saying about contra aid president arias who is the author of the live and viable plan of the moment said when he received his nobel peace prize that president reagan knows very welland i quote that the contras are the problem and not the solution and yesterday the people who have been active n the contadora process said this we urgently call upon the countries with ties or interests in the region to halt unconditionally unilaterally and immediately any actions aimed at destablization or any type of aid to irregular forces as is established in the san jose declaration for the attainment of peace and democracy n central america in conclusion i would say let us give peace a chance let us give the people in the region a chance we have been trying the military solution for 6 years now let us give the other way a chance let us give life to the words of a great american uttered about his brother

present unitedstates tax laws the report was compiled by arthur young inc one of the nations largest and most reliable accounting firms in comparing the tax policies of the united states with those of the netherlands japan and germany the disadvantage was quite apparent this competitive disadvantage in world markets is present today due to enacted federal tax policy over the past 20 years including the 1986 tax reform act the primary reason this has occurred is due to the fact that many other countries have adopted tax policies that to varying degrees encourage firms to do business overseas essentially the united states has adopted exactly the opposite policy it is no wonder we are experiencing record trade deficits with a tax policy that is complex vague and discouraging to multinational companies the simple fact is that congress has failed miserably when it comes to encouraging business to engage in the international market instead congress prefers the easier route of protectionism we must aggressively seek to change the tax structure so that it is fair and equitable to do business overseas which will then in turn reduce our trade deficits though his competitive disadvantage has been accumulating over several years of federal tax policy arthur young inc has pointed out three very obvious disadvantages of the unitedstates multinational companies first when exemptions or deferrals foreign tax credits and tax treaties are taken into account the unitedstates multinationals most often are at the highest end of the tax rate scale on foreign operations compared to other countries even though the 1986 tax reform act lowered the nominal corporate tax rate many unitedstates companies will face increased tax liability on foreign source income second the united states has no treaty in which it agrees to spare unitedstates tax on income that could have been but was not taxed by a lesser developed country many other countries have such a tax sparing treaty the main effect of this absent treaty is that it hinders the unitedstates ability to access the low cost labor and raw materials of third world countries in a way that would enable these companies to compete equally in world trade third the third reason that puts the unitedstates multinational companies at a competitive disadvantage is the extent to which the present federal tax treaties modify the two above reasons this study has made me aware of a very serious problem with our international trade tax system in the coming weeks i plan to solicit the views of top multinational corporations in america on how to address this situation only then can we begin to answer the comfebruar~y 25 1988 cor plex questions facing our international trade problems"],

forest service report that as much as 90 percent of the archeological sites on federal lands in the southwest have been looted or vandalized this high level of historical resource destruction cannot go unchecked the 8 years of experience since the passage of arpa have demonstrated that there are weaknesses in the law that make it extremely difficult to prosecute looters in fact there has been only one arpa felony conviction by jury since the law was passed because of the weaknesses in arpa federal prosecutors often resort to statutes other than arpa to prosecute archeological looters the compromise legislation before the house today makes four important changes to current law which will strengthen enforcement of arpa and significantly reduca the level of looting of americas archeological sites the first provision will change current law which requires that an artifact be worth 5 000 before the crime can be prosecuted as a felony the bill will lower the threshold to 500 to bring in many more artifacts second it will make attempt to excavate an archeological site a prohibited activity under arpa this change will allow the prosecution of looters who are caught digging but who havent yet retrieved ihe object third it will strike the requirement under current law that an artifact must be of archaeological interest this provision of current law only confuses juries and injects a subjective view of archeological resources into the courtroom fourth it will require each federal land manager to establish a program to increase public awareness of the significance of archeological resources this legislation will reverse the shocking increa3e in recent years in arche115866 ological site looling the unitedstates attorneys in arizona and utah who are partly

the unitedstates government was in effect going into partnership with the farm credit system in an effort to make sure that the farm credit system survived while at the same time we were entering into that partnership that assistance to the system we would be with the secondary market establishing competition with the system itself so there seemed to be a conflict as far as the interests of the taxpayers and the efforts we were putting forth in fact we could succeed in destroying the farm credit system in our zeal to create the secondary market as we reflect upon this i think that we have to keep in mind what the principal objective is the principal objective has to be to provide financing to our nations farmers to make money available and the facts are that today that is not the case there is a shortage of financing for farmers there is a shortage that we can see in the foreseeable future so with that in mind i felt it was important that we would create the secondary market and we do it in such a manner that we give the farm credit system the best possible chance to survive and hopefully we will create two systems that will actively compete against each other that will profit
