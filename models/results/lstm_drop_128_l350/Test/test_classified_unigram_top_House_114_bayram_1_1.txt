country because a person with evil in their heart was able to get his hands on a gun this horrific event was the 294th mass shooting that we have seen in 2015 more than any other country in the world so far this year we have mourned nine parishioners who were killed during bible study at their church in charleston south carolina two women who were killed and nine others who were injured at a movie theater in lafayette louisiana and a local television reporter and her cameraman who died covering a story outside lynchburg virginia but there were thousands of other victims of gun violence their deaths have garnered less media attention but they too deserve to have their sto ries told in the united states this year more than 10 000 people have died and more than 20 000 have been injured during an incident that involved a gun each day an average of 92 americans are killed in an incident involving a gun yesterday the victims included the supervisor of a food market in houston who was killed by a disgruntled employee a 21yearold father of two in louisville and a 23yearold man and an 18yearold woman who were killed outside new orleans during a driveby shooting altogether nearly 1 5 million americans have lost their lives to gun violence since the year 1970 i have no doubt that every one of my colleagues in this chamber has spent much of the last few days thinking about and praying for the victims in oregon and their families i know i have but to put it bluntly our thoughts and prayers arent good enough not for those who have already been killed and not for the 92 americans who are going to lose their lives today tomorrow and every day until we do something thoughts and prayers wont bring back the innocent men women and children who have been killed or heal the families that have been torn apart thoughts and prayers are no excuse for inaction and cowardice in the face of powerful special interests it is on all of us to do better than thoughts and prayers it is long past time to take actions to reduce the threat of gun violence and to do all we can to protect our constituents from the ravages of this epidemic earlier this year i introduced a package of three bills to get to the core of our countrys problem with gun violence by focusing on keeping guns from children criminals and those who are severely mentally ill such that possession of a firearm would pose a threat to themselves or others the end purchase of firearms by dangerous individuals act h r 2917 requires that states provide information to the national instant criminal background check system on individuals who are committed to a mental institution or make a threat of violence to a mental health professional that demonstrates that this individual would present a danger to himself or others if armed with a gun the fire sale loophole closing act h r 2916 ends the practice by which federally licensed gun dealers who lose their licenses for misconduct can convert their entire inventory to a personal collection in order to liquidate it without conducting background checks on their customers under the law such dealers could transfer their inventory only to other properly licensed federal gun dealers i also introduced a resolution h con res 59 to support the goals of national ask day which falls on june 21 each year national ask day encourages parents to ask other parents whether their children are playing in a house with an unlocked gun in the united states 1 7 million children are in homes with loaded unlocked guns this initiative is supported by head start the american public health association and the american academy of pediatrics in addition to these measures that i have introduced i have also cosponsored the large capacity ammunition feeding device act to ban the sale of largecapacity magazines and denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act to prohibit individuals suspected of ties to terrorist organizations from purchasing a gun and h r 2380 and h r 3411 which fix our broken background check system any of these bills would immediately improve public safety in this country a country that sees its citizens die

united states the truth is that more than 100 000 are at risk of being trafficked for commercial sex here in the united states each and every year here in america we have a word for a situation when one group of people is dehumanized and has their basic human rights snuffed out for someone elses economic gain that word is slavery the problem we have today is not a thing of the past it is not from some remote corner of the world that you cant find on a map slavery in the form of human trafficking is happening right now it is happening in our cities suburbs and rural communities it is happening in each and every one of our congressional districts i am sad to say that minneapolis minnesota my home state has actually been listed as one of the 13th largest centers for sexual exploitation of children in the entire country i realize how critical it is to educate our community about what i have learned from talking to victims like dayanna who became a 13yearold trafficking victim dayanna didnt get a lot of love and attention from her mother or family while she took it upon herself to take care of her brothers and sisters she longed for someone to give her love and attention she ended up being seduced by a man who promised to be her boyfriend guess what at age 13 within days after running away with him she found herself being trafficked in chicago and philadelphia without a home and separated from her family only a daring jump from a secondstory window actually allowed her to escape many might think that if dayanna had come from a different family situation she wouldnt have been trafficked sadly that is not the case i will never forget meeting with the mother of a young woman named brittany brittany was a very young girl who was violently raped murdered and then found dead in an impound lot last february unlike dayanna brittany had a loving family she worked with children at a local recreation center and taught dance lessons despite these circumstances brittany was also a victim of sex trafficking but was too embarrassed to speak out until it was too late as brittanys mother told me it doesnt matter if victims have a home because if sex trafficking can happen to my daughter it can happen to any young girl that is exactly what we are talking about young girls who are only 12 13 or 14 years old they are not old enough to have graduated from high school they are not old enough to have voted in an election they are not old enough to pass their drivers license exam in fact in most states these girls would be considered criminals that should be incarcerated and charged with prostitution instead of being treated as victims we found that criminalization only traumatizes these girls and actually isolates them from the community and the services that they need and deserve that is why we need this legislation h r 159 the stop exploitation through trafficking act which focuses on incentivizing states to have safe harbor laws safe harbor laws ensure that these girls are treated as victims safe harbor laws will give legal protection for minor victims and provide them with specialized social services we know that by bringing these victims out of the shadows we can make sure they get the services they need including medical and psychological treatment housing legal services educational assistance job training and more law enforcement can then focus on actually bringing the perpetrators of these awful crimes to justice this bipartisan legislation incentivizes states to adopt these safe harbor laws so we can expand on the successes we have seen in states like minnesota in 2011 minnesota became the fifth state to approve safe harbor legislation after their safe harbor laws went into effect guess what law enforcement in minnesota began arresting more johns than ever before and human trafficking convictions more than doubled best practices evaluated by law enforcement and victims groups show that removing the fear of prosecution from victims actually works today only a little over a dozen states have full safe harbor laws we have got to do more to protect these victims and be sure the pimps and johns are brought to justice this legislation also helps victims by codifying a national human trafficking hotline and making victims eligible for job corps services by giving them an avenue to access for job skill training they can begin to rebuild their lives the bill also helps law enforcement by allowing the unitedstates marshals service to support other state local or federal law enforcement agencies that are investigating missing child cases finally the bill increases oversight by requiring additional reporting to congress on restitution orders in trafficking cases these provisions are all essentially critically

transparency the foreign assistance dashboard created in 2010 demonstrated a promising inclination towards disclosure that we should hope to enshrine in law this measure will strengthen and codify

to the agencys it systems in practice this would erode collective bargaining rights by excluding any impact or implementation of such an action from collective bargaining requirements such as reasonable accommodations to allow an employee to communicate with family members or schools h r 4361 also subjects the members of our senior executive service to the political whims of presidents by stripping them of their ability to appeal their termination after a decision by an administrative law judge the department of justice has declined to defend the constitutionality of similar provisions

and against the resolutionwell actually in favor of the resolution of approval i must say in starting we are at a paradoxical moment the fears the haunting specter a terrible thing the existential threats posed by a nuclear iran are all legitimate fears and legitimate haunting specters regional hegemony to be avoided but ironically those concerns and those fears and those outcomes raised by my friends on the other side of the aisle and the opponents of this agreement actually come true and are realized if we do what they want us to do which is to reject this agreement the alternative to this agreement is an opaque unconstrained iranian nuclear program hanging like the sword of damocles over all of our heads and the security of the united states and israel and regional partners who knows the false hope offered by the critics is lets return to the negotiating table to seek a better deal a man that i respect at one of our hearings that chairman ed royce chaired on the house foreign affairs committee former senator joe lieberman said just that i said how did that work he said well lets just go back to the partners and iran and say we just couldnt sell it lets start over the proposition that we would renounce our own agreement that we negotiated wrought by more than a year of tough negotiations and expect that our negotiating partners including russia and china and of course iran itself would sit back down at the table and start all over again under our leadership is specious if not delusional as an argument we cannot be naive about the scenario in which congress rejects this agreement brokered by our own country among our allies we divest ourselves of the goodwill that undergirded these negotiations and among our adversaries we would confirm their suspicion we cannot be trusted the international sanctions regime that drove iran to the negotiating table would collapse and our diplomatic leverage would be diminished in all future unitedstates led negotiations most concerning of all we would return once again to the situation we are at one of deep anxiety and uncertainty regarding irans nuclear ambitions critics of the agreement have offered no alternative and have tried to define that agreement by what it is not it is not a perfect deal that dismantles every nut and bolt of the iranian nuclear development program peaceful or otherwise it is not a comprehensive resolution of the entire relationship and the myriad issues the unitedstates and our allies have with the repressive regime in tehran and its reprehensible support for terrorist insurgencies in the region no one ever said it would be what arms control agreement in the history of our country has ever attempted to circumscribe every aspect of a relationship with an adversary and certainly not this one in other words this agreement is the diplomatic alternative we sought to attain when we entered into these very negotiations the deal adheres to the high standards of verification transparency and compliance on which any acceptable agreement with iran must be founded that isnt just my word that is what former republican secretary of state colin powell says that is what republican former nsc adviser brent scowcroft says that is what former republican senator john warner from my state says the agreement erects an unprecedented and intrusive inspection regime that provides the iaea with access to declared nuclear facilities and suspected covert nuclear development sites additionally they will be able to monitor irans entire nuclear program supply chain including uranium mines mills centrifuges rotors bellows production storage facilities and dedicated procurement for nuclearrelated or dualuse materials technology the agreement also rolls back major components and places strict restrictions on the iranian nuclear program if these restrictions are not adhered to the united states can at any time unilaterally revive the sanctions currently in place congress should immediately begin to conduct close oversight to ensure those terms are implemented and that iran is living up to its obligations this isnt about trust it was ronald reagan who said trust but verify former secretary of state clinton today kind of echoed those words saying distrust and verify and that is why she supports the agreement it does just that more broadly the united states must signal to iran that its condemnable record on human rights terrorism and regional subversion will not be tolerated nor will we hide with this agreement that action and our response to it in fact quite the opposite we will redouble our efforts to stop them in that egregious behavior in closing article i section 8 clause 11 of the constitution vests congress with the duty to authorize

regulation of private equity and not the rollbacks we see today in h r 5424 this is from a june 25 2016 article titled when you dial 911 and wall street answers since the 2008 financial crisis private equity firms the corporate raiders of an earlier era have increasingly taken over a wide array of civic and financial services that are central to american life unlike other forprofit companies which often have years of experience making a product or offering a service private equity is primarily skilled in making money and in many of these businesses the times found private equity firms applied a sophisticated moneymaking playbook a mix of cost cuts price increases lobbying and litigation in emergency care and firefighting this approach creates a fundamental tension the push to turn a profit while caring for people in their most vulnerable moments this article then goes on to describe how response times slowed and lives were put in dangerand i am talking about the response time of fire departments that are now controlled by equity fundswhen these profithungry wall street firms took over essential public health services like ensuring ambulances arrived to victims on time from an article titled how housings new players spiraled into banks old mistakes dated june 26 2016 when the housing crisis sent the american economy to the brink of disaster in 2008 millions of people lost their homes the banking system had failed homeowners and their families new investors soon swept inmainly private equity firmspromising to do better but some of these new investors are repeating the mistakes that banks committed throughout the housing crisis an investigation by the new york times has found they are quickly foreclosing on homeowners they are losing families mortgage paperwork much as the banks did and many of these practices were enabled by the federal government which sold tens of thousands of discounted mortgages to private equity investors while making few demands on how they treated struggling homeowners the rising importance of private equity in the housing market is one of the most consequential transformations of the postcrisis american financial landscape a home after all is the single largest investment most families will ever make private equity firms and the mortgage companies they own face less oversight than the banks and yet they are the cleanup crew for the worst housing crisis since the great depression the article then goes on to describe how private equity firms can squeeze fees out of homeowners during every stage of the foreclosure process often through conflicts of interest that make foreclosure more profitable than providing sustainable loan modifications this investigated series by the new york times exposes practices that i think no credible member of congress would want to be associated with this is horrible that we could even think that we are allowing our citizens to be placed at risk and their lives jeopardized because we have a private equity firm that is brought up and is now in control of critical services to our citizens and they have to do it and make a profit the way they make that profit is they cut back on personnel equipment machinery or whatever it takes to turn that dollar i am absolutely amazed that any member of congress would dare to think about supporting this kind of legislation that would allow these practices not only to continue in ways that i have described and let me just remind you i dont know how we can soon forget the crisis that this country experienced in 2008 when we had this subprime meltdown and we had so many foreclosures so many families that were literally put on the streets because they lost their home because of practices that were not regulated by this government
