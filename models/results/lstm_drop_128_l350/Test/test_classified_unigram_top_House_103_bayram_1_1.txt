this plan they are making two great assumptions one is that the tax revenues they estimate are really going to happen and second that there will be some control over the numbers the dollars that we spend on this plan on the first point are the new tax rates really going to bring in the revenue we estimate i do not think so all we have to do is look at 1990 and realize that the expected and their tax revenue actuallydecreased the second point that i would make is that when this plan goes into effect and people lose their jobs they are not working they are not earning money and they are not paying taxes on the second point we are going to control spending there are no controls in this plan on entitlement spending none e h5671 whatsoever eighty percent of the cuts are in years four and

up 4 500 we are still about 6 000 short at the same time we are cashiering out of the military about 2 000 young people every week that means if we just took 3 weeks worth of personnel slots where young marines and army and air force and coast guard personnel are being cashiered just 3 weeks of people who are being taken out of the air force and put those job slots in the border patrol we would be able to stop illegal immigration in the southwest similarly about 350 000 bureauqrats or federal workers work in washington dc not counting the department of defense if we took 6 000 of those slots of those 350 000 people who work in washington dc in administration doing paperwork if we took just 6 000 of those slots and put them on the border then we could stop illegal immigration so illegal

agree with the gentleman from california mr dolnan what happened to our troops in somalia was a disgrace but i want to point out what i think is a solution not only for somalia or for haiti or for bosnia i think we have to have a plan the gentleman mentioned before in his opening statement that the pundits are asking what kind of grade is clinton getting in foreign affairs or what kind of a grade is bush getting and so on i do not want to focus on that although i will say this clinton is not even in the same league with bush when it comes to foreign affairs everybody would have to agree with that but i am not interested in the politics of it what i am concerned about here is that we are not guided today in foreign policy by any principle or any philosophy it is all expediency the problem with that is in a country like this you can only move ahead if you have the blessing of the people on the issues and the initiatives being taken by our leader our government can only function if it has the trust and confidence of the people and you cannot get trust and confidence of the people if you are guided by expediency so i would say that for us we have to have certain principals where we are guided by a certain formula and if foreign issues arise and they fit into this formula i think then we should be guided by that formula so we have a road map so we have a procedure that we can follow and i would say in considering our involvements overseas whether we use unitedstates troops i think we have to ask ourselves consistently four questions basically they are these how is our national security the national security of the united states threatened that would be the first question seeond we have to ask is there a clearly defined mission for our forces so when we put our forces into somalia or as the gentleman here had mentioned into haiti so that we have a missiofor our troops and so we know whether we have met our mission third do our troops have a reasonable chance of success there are some places in this world no matter how much power we are going to apply or how much treasures we are going to pour into that region we are never going to be successful because there is no chance of success we do net have enough leverage in some parts of the world and that is why we have to focus on this third question is there a reasonable chance of success fourth how are we going to get our troops out you know the thing that has always amazed me is that american troops have been deployed to all parts of the world and we have never asked the question how are we going to get them out to me this is a blind foreign policy we cannot go in that direction we have got to have a criterion a plan we do not today that is why we are facing all of these little disasters all over the world i think that these four questions are relevant in fact the secretary of state himself has enunciated four questions pretty much like this and we have to have a criterion for us when we are involved so that we can go to the american people or at least the president should be able to go to the american people and say that we are going into somalia but here is how i answer these four questions here is why we are going in here are the chances for our success here is our mission and here is how we are going to get our troops out i think if the preakdent the commander in chief cannot explain that to the american people and to this congress then we should not be going into these areas because we are only going to take our nation down the road to pain terrifi pain i yield to the

committee was not made available to the house so therefore at that time we asked that the whole of the information be presented the reason now becomes clear for presenting us with all the information with the recent conviction of a former officer of the house we now understand that there was a widespread problem in the house post office it may involve as the recent documentation indicates several

distinguished colleague from kansas our fearless leader on the commit tee on agriculture tonights debate for me is really the whole reason why i ran for congress the whole reason i got into this crazy business in the first place is because i recognized what the deficit and the national debt was doing to our kids and maybe selfishly doing to my kids in fact when my son mark was born there was a bill in his crib because of the deficit and debt in thiscountry of 15 000 you might think well jny son is what paying more than his fair share no every person in this country has that kind of bill sitting at their table right now to pay as a result of our problems so what do we do what do we do we hear about cutting we hear about fair share well fair share has definitely been provided by farmers in fact over the past decade as my colleague for kansas indicated farmers have contributed 57 billion to deficit reduction 57 billion are we complaining no maybe a little bit only because we feel that maybe some other sectors have not contributed as much but we will take that and we will even up the ante farmers have told me we will contribute more in deficit reduction through more spending cuts so the committee on agriculture this year was asked to make a few cuts we did we cut 12 9 billion out of farm progranis for farmers in the committee on agriculture we went along with it only because we knew we had to provide our fair share but only until we found out what that savings was going for you know what it was going for the same thing farmers across the country complain about all the time the fact that we use farm program reductions for food stamp increases increases 7 3 billion was increased in this agriculture budget because 6f the effect of get this the btu tax you might ask what is going on here the clinton administration believes that because of the effects of the btu tax that they are going to have to increase food stamps 7 9 billion just to make up the difference the committee on agriculture cannot stand for that republicans stand firm on the fact that those cuts should not go if we are going to cut in agriculture programs it needs to go to deficit reduction and not toward food stamp programs when there has been no reform of the program no revitalization no streamlining no efficiencies that is promised down the line just like everything else has been promised in this country but nothing was done today the btu tax is supposed to bring in 70 billion over the next 5 years but in order to offset that we have increased welfare programs 40 billion because we expect because of the btu tax more and more people to be dependent on welfare forced into that dependency we heard just a moment ago the majority leader indicate that arent we special we are increasing the earned income tax credit why somebody needs to ask him that because the btu tax is driving people into poverty the farmer must take the risk the farmer must grow the food the farmer must transport the food then he has got to finance the food then he has got to market the food then he has to sell the food and now we are telling farmers stand in line in order to earn food stamps so you can buy back your food and that is ridiculous in this kind of economy what are we telling the young farmers out there we are telling them dont come back to the farm dont come back to the farm we dont need you we dont need you just make farmers get bigger get bigger spend more money that is what we are encouraging them to do none of those young farmers that iowa has lost or any other district in this country are going to come running back to the farm in order to grow food under this kind of a plan that is ridiculous that is not economic growth and revitalization clinton talked about patriots in his state of the union address he talked about all americans being patriots farmers are patriots they are not patsies and we cannot stand for a btu tax that is offset by welfare programs to drive farmers into welfare so that they can in fact be eligible for those same programs in a recent tax foundation study that just came out today iowa alone because of the effect of the btu tax according to this independent foundation is going to lose 4 779 jobs that is economic growth folks in fact my district alone if this btu tax passes is going to lose 890 jobs in just my district is that economic growth ask yourself who of you out there is willing to give up your job for this btu tax there are a lot of congressmen i think who are probably going to lose their job over this let me tell you this about the state of the union address the state of the union address for me was exciting because i felt as a newcomer to congress that we had a president that was willing to stand up to the plate and deal with the budget deficit you know what happened when he went out to sell this plan to people not the republicans but the people they said cut spending first what did he do he abandoned his sales pitch now what happens we have democrats by the droves running to the floor of the house to save the presidents plan when he himself is not selling when he himself is not out advertising when he himself is letting democrats fall on the sword people ask me gridlock in congress jim how do you get around gridlock in congress folks gridlock is over gridlock is over on this side we cannot stand in the way of their plan how many do they have they have more than 218 dont they if they dont maybe the gridlock is on their side of the aisle and maybe they have to face up to that fact not on the republican side of course we are not going to vote for it are you crazy we are not going to drive people out of work but if you want to you provide the votes you pass the presidents plan he is not calling republicans he has not called me he has not asked me to support the plan he has not asked me how it affects farmers in iowa they say be specific we have got kasich we even have two amendments that we are willing to introduce this week if they will let us will they let us have an open rule people out there watching they say what is an open rule that doesnt make any sense that is procedural an open rule means we get to debate this we get to offer our amendments and we get to offer our specifics we will see if they let us put your money where your mouth is so to speak i think what we have to do is face up to the reality of what this plan is really going to mean i think it is probably put best in the words of president clintons barber president clintons barber probably would say clinton is hair today and gone tomorrow what is most disturbing about the past 4 months is that the way of doing business in the house of representatives has not changed my constituents tell me they are willing to sacrifice to reduce the federal budget deficit they have said repeatedly they are willing to step up to the plate and take their fair share of the hits to fight the red ink spending in washington but thars not what has happened first rural america took its share of hits when agricultural programs were cut 2 9 billion but the hits didnt end there they were also informed that in addition to 2 9 billion in cuts for agriculture they would get hit with a btu tax that will cost farmers between 1 000 and 4 000 per year and they will get hit again with a barge tax that is expected to increase the cost of each bushel of corn between 5 and 10 cents but the hits dont just end there either the money resulting from the cuts in farm programs and increased taxes will not go to the 4 trillion debt hanging over our heads instead congress has decided that any savings resulting from farm program cuts and tax increases will go to fund new federal programs after the house of representatives votes on the budget reconciliation package this week and the dust settles it is rural america that will carry the burden of increased taxes rural america no doubt

particularly bothers me if i understand this correctly currently if a highway is put through a community the persons who give up their homes for the highway construction are compensated that is a taking and they are reimbursed hopefully adequately but the people who used to look at homes and are now looking at highway are not currently compensated under our system and it would bankrupt the

administrations deficit reduction package represents a historic change for the country and el paso congress voted to reverse 12 years of squeezethemiddleclass policies of the reaganbush years certainly there are plenty of critics whopan the clinton administration deficit reduction plan as having done too much or not enough in comparison to what i had a front row seat for a decade of the reaganbush years and their initiatives hardly resulted in greater investment or smaller deficits when ronald reagan moved into the white house the deficit was just over 74 billion and the national debt was just under 1 billion when george bush moved out of the white house the deficit was racing past 300 billion and the national debt stood at just over 4 trillion the test of the clinton deficit plan should not be perfection rather it should be does this plan offer a change of direction from failed trickledown economics that brought us shrinking incomes record unemployment soaring debt and more families living in poverty than in the last 40 years the clinton plan delivers that change of direction surely even given its worst assessment the clinton plan delivers that change of direction surely even given its worst assessment the clinton plan could come nowhere close to the reckless results of the past two republican administrations and what do my republican colleagues choose to do to set this situation right nothing not a single member of the party which brought us this debt was willing to begin to reverse the spend now pay later policies which their party wrought more than 40 republican members voted no on every plan even their own partys instead the republican party embarked on an unprecedented campaign of misinformation falsely alleging the middle class would get soaked and that small business would be robbed by the clinton plan now the facts not a single family with a gross adjusted income under 180 000 a year will pay a penny more in income taxes need i repeat that families with higher incomes will pay higher taxes as they should during the last decade the wealthy saw their incomes increase at a rate of about 136 percent as a result of trickle down economics during this same period middleclass families incomes fell the clinton plan restores progressivity and tax fairness and asks that the wealthiest do the most to help reduce the deficit middleclass families are asked to pay only about 1 a week in the form of the gas tax and every penny of that weekly dollar will go directiy to reducing the deficit but the clinton plan does more than just reduce the projected deficit by about 500 billion it also invests in families and in small business in el paso alone families living in poverty despite both parents fulltime jobs will receive 86 million in assistance to lift them out of poverty and reward their economic contribution more than one in three of every family in el paso will see their taxes cut and their incomes increased fewer than 1 000 families in the entire county actually have incomes high enough to require that they pay higher income taxes most importantly the snall businessowners of our country are finally going to get their just rewards for having done their best during the long recession to keep their heads above water and create jobs the clinton plan will provide some of the most lucrative tax incentives ever offered to small business to say otherwise is dishonest even the wall street journals analysis of the small business package last week carded a headline that read higher expenditure ceiling retroactive too promises an array of breaks the package includes a 50percent cut in the capital gains tax rate for investment in small business a 75percent increase in expensing of investments in equipment and an extension of the health insurance deduction for the selfemployed in fact 95 percent of small business or 6 million entrepreneurs will see their taxes go down under the clinton plan this is not the largest tax increase in history it is the largest deficit reduction package in history because it restores tax falmess and cuts 260 billion from projected govemment spending those are the facts"],
