charged with protecting our borders could be making their yearly salary in just a matter of days by taking bribes that is right bribes border patrol agents our the first line of defense in the fight to secure americas borders may have dirty money on their mind instead of illegals all the while they are compromising national security for a fist full of dollars this month two border patrol supervisors pleaded guilty after accepting 200 000 in bribes and working with the illegals to come into the united states these supervisors were working on a test program set up between the border patrol and the mexican government where human smugglers coyotes as we call them were arrested in the united states and were supposed to be deported back to mexico for prosecution this is the same program that these officials have been raving about they even came to washington and testified before congress that 82 suspected smugglers were returned back to mexico last year but what is worse is these supervisors used a government vehicle to bring two smugglers across the border one bought his way out of jail for a 10 000 bribe while another shelled out 6 000 in bribes so he wouldnt be shipped back to mexico then these two agents new best friends of these two individuals dropped them off at a walmart parking lot their case isnt the only one that is under investigation in fact it is far from it other border patrol agents charged with upholding our laws and our sovereign borders are facing federal charges and investigations border patrol agent oscar ortiz was in fact not even a united states citizen an illegal himself and he used a false birth certificate to get this become a unitedstates border agent andwork on our border his lies were only discovered as he conspired to smuggle in over 100 different people into the united states another example two border patrol agents brothers have vanished into the darkness of mexico because they were being investigated for smuggling drugs and illegal immigrants into the united states once they figured out that the federal bureau of investigation was out to capture them they took off and disappeared as i said into mexico two other agents were indicted for taking bribes and allowing illegals to cross our border for a few dollars experts say targeting border agents is an easy task you see here is what happens on the other side of the river they watch our border agents with binoculars they say coyotes look for weak inspectors and then they test them to see whether or not they are lawful the way they do it is they send someone across the border someone like a woman who will flirt with the agent until he lets her in and the people that are with her in once this occurs then these individuals are approached by these coyotes to see if they will let more people in all in the name of money our national leaders are divided over what to do with immigration what to do with the people that are here illegally but the country cannot be divided over corruption on the border by border agents americans h5818 co arent okay with people buying and flirting their way into the united states they demand safe and secure borders and honest and upstanding border patrol agents make no doubt about it most of our border patrol agents are honest hardworking men and women but we must make an example of anyone who breaks the immigration laws no matter which side of the border they live on from time to time we point out even on this house floor corruption of some mexican government officials that work along the southern border when they are helping drug smugglers and coyotes all in the name of filthy lucre so we cannot tolerate a few border agents who in the name of money sell out america and insult the good name of most of our border agents so all of those who make money off of illegal entrants should be accountable and it makes no difference who they are the rule of law should be enforced it is illegal to enter the united states without permission that is the rule and it should be enforced by honest border agents and people that enter illegally should be held accountable it makes no difference who those people are whether they are illegals that cross whether they are narcoterrorists that bring money or drugs into the united states to sell whether they are coyotes or whether they are illicit

act has been instrumental in building todays workforce and the workforce of the future today these programs are changing in the face of secondary and postsecondary education and they equip americas workforce with the skills they need to compete in a global economy more important career tech programs acknowledge that we must be preparing students and adults for high wage high skill jobs that exist in this new economy to do this however we need a system that is challenging and academically sound and a system expands the secondary and postsecondary programs offering students a pathway toward those kinds of careers i am pleased that the conference agreement mirrors the recommendations we have heard that we must pay more attention to math and science and technology to increase our

technical programs successful techprep programs offer a challenging and rigorous coursework at the high school level that is coordinated with postsecondary career technical programs and techprep

and vocational teachers to develop curriculums together to teach together so that students can apply the academic content to the real world context this conference agreement contains new measures of accountability for career and technical education systems i do not doubt that some programs may have difficulties in meeting this new system however there have been too many programs that have chosen the status quo to the detriment of our workforce competitiveness successful career and technical education programs produce students that outperform their counterparts and make higher wages we must demand that all programs work toward this same goal the accountability systems move us in that direction i want to point out two other areas where the conference agreement improves upon the house passed bill graduation and career plans under the agreement local programs may use perkins funds to create graduation and career plans for students these plans can be tools for students and parents to help focus the student on the students future goals making sure that the actions that we take will lead to the outcome they desire and also the special populations and nontraditional careers the

with my congratulations and thanks to the gentleman from michigan the chairman of the subcommittee he and i worked in the last session along with the gentleman from texas and the gentleman from michigan and other members of our committee in order to draft legislation which is very similar to the legislation which we are passing here today i would like if it is permissible within the rules to also thank the democrat and republican members of the other body for their work on this legislation as well we truly passed this legislation in a bicameral bipaitisan fashion first let me state that back in ancient prehistoric political times back in 1991 that i was the principal house sponsor of the telephone consumer protection act which contained the original junk fax prohibition in 1991 that legislation passed this body and this general prohibition against junk faxes became law because of this intrusive form of advertising every time someone junk faxes you it is your paper that is coming out of the machine you are paying for that paper your machine is tied up it is just absolutely one of the most irritating things to people to have to pay for someone else coming into your hormie or your business when you do not want them there it is essentially a tax which is paid by the recipient of something that they never asked for in the first place this is something that ultimately takes up precious time as well the machine is tied up there is too much clutter that is associated with it and important faxes are lost in the midst of the pile of junk faxes how many people have just taken a pile of junk faxes throwi it away and in the middle of i t was a fax you really wanted from someone but you were just so ticked off by this generally unwanted clutter which has come into your home or your business so i think it is important to emphasize that the bill we bring to the house floor today retains the general prohibition against sending junk faxes in other words sending an unsolicited facsimile advertisement is against the law we are not changing the law or the policy with respect to this sending a junk fax was illegal and it remains illegal under this bill neither are we changing any of the statutory enforcement mechanisms available to the federal communications commission or to the individual consumers themselves in this bill the legislation we are proposing will address certain provisions affecting an exception to the general prohibition against sending junk faxes and will improve the bill in these areas i think that it cannot be emphasized enough how this bill is the product again of the bipartisan work that both parties have engaged in over the last 2 or 3 years to reach todays final product and i urge the house to adopt unanimously this legislation today i rise in support of this bill this legislation builds upon legislation that was passed by the house in the last congress and which this year was negotiated out between both democratic and republican members in the other body over a number of months i encourage members to support this legislation today first let me state that i was the principal house sponsor of the telephone consumer protection act tcpa of 1991 which contained the original junk fax prohibition congress endorsed my call in 1991 for a general prohibition against junk faxes because of the intrusive nature of that form of advertising junk faxes represent a form of advertising in which the ad is essentially paid for by the recipient the recipient of a junk fax pays for the fax paper and printer costs pays in the form of precious lost time as the machine is tied up and also in the form of the clutter in which important faxes are lost in the midst of a pile of junk faxes i think it is important to emphasize that the bill we bring to the house floor today retains the general prohibition against sending junk faxes in other words sending an unsolicited facsimile advertisement is against the law we are not changing the law or the policy with respect to thissending a junk fax was illegal and remains illegal under this bill neither are we changing any of the statutory enforcement mechanisms available to the fcc or consumers in this bill the legislation we are proposing will address certain provisions affecting an exception to the general prohibition against sending junk faxes and will improve the bill in these areas since the fcc originally implemented the 1991 junk fax provisions of the tcpa commission regulations contained an exception for faxes that were sent because an established business relationship existed between the sender and the recipient these regulations were in place and the ability to send junk faxes based upon this exception was permitted by the commission for over a decade this concept of an established business relationship perriiitted a commercial entity to invoke its ability to demonstrate such a relationship with a consumer in order to contact that consumer in spite of the general prohibitions of the law the fcc has more recently determined that the term established business relationship was not specifically included in the provisions addressing junk faxes in the tcpa and therefore changed its regulations the new rules proposed by the commission require written permission from consumers and these new rules have been stayed from going into effect until june 30th of this year just a few short days away the legislation before us is designed to put specific language into the statute permitting an established business relationship exception to the general prohibition against junk faxes many businesses have complained that written permission is too onerous a regulatory requirement for many of the faxes that they stipulate are routinely sent in the ordinary course of business to established customers or customers requesting such faxes this has been done by reputable business entities presumably without complaints from the recipients of such faxes we must recognize however that many small businesses and residential consumers find many of these unsolicited faxes including those faxes sent because a valid claim of an established business relationship was being asserted to be a considerable irritant and strongly object to receiving them the legislation therefore addresses additional issues including putting into the statute an optout ability for consumers to object to receiving junk faxes even when such faxes are sent to them based upon an established business relationship for the decade that the original fcc regulations were in place many consumers simply were not aware of the fccs established business relationship exception nor did very many know they had an ability to stop these faxes or any clear way in which to effectuate such a request the bill the house is considering includes new provisions requiring an optout notice and policy that we will add to the statute the bill requires junk faxes to include on the first page a clear and conspicuous notice to consumers that they have the right not to receive future junk faxes from the sender second the notice must include a domestic contact telephone number and fax number for consumers to transmit a request not to receive future faxes third the substitute requires the notice to conform with the commissions technical and procedural standards for sending faxes under section 227 d of the law which include the requirement to identify the entity sending the facsimile advertisement this is an important provision because one of the biggest complaints from the fcc at the hearing and with other law enforcement entities and aggrieved consumers is that they have had difficulty legally identifying the source of many of the unsolicited faxes in addition there were some senders of junk faxes who evidently and false ly believed that simply because they were sending an unsolicited fax based upon their ability to prove they had an established business relationship with a consumer and thus did not have to abide by the general prohibition against such faxes that this also meant they did not have to abide by the other fcc and statutory technical rules these statutory and regulatory rules include requirements that junk fax senders identify themselves in such faxes law enforcement entities and consumers need to be able to find the legal business name or widely recognized trade name of the entity sending a junk fax in violatioq of the rules in order to pursue enforcement actions fourth this bill makes it clear that a consumer can optout of receiving faxes to multiple machines if they have more than one rather than opting out solely for the particular machine that received the junk fax fifth in this legislation the commission is tasked with exploring additional mechanisms by which a consumer might optout such as in person or by email or regular mail and also requests that the commission establish costfree ways by which consumers can optout these notice and optout requirements all represent new provisions to the law for which existing enforcementremedies will apply this legislation also includes the ability for the fcc to limit the duration of an established business relationship notwithstanding the fact that the law would include an optout notice and ability which avails consumers of the right to optout of receiving faxes atany point in time i believe this is an important concept and one which deals with the legitimate expectations of consumers if a consumer buys something from a store consumers might expect to hearfrom that store within a reasonable period of time over time however a consumers expectation changes and there is a time after which the established business relationship can be said to have lapsed finally i think it is important to take a comprehensive look at overall enforcement of the junk fax law i am concerned that some of the most egregious junk fax operations the entities that broadcast such faxes to millions often escap6 enforcement they may be found guilty cited by the fcc and sometimes finedbut often it appears as if they either ignore the fines skip town or live overseas for these reasons the bill includes provisions that will give us an annual accounting of the fccs enforcement activities as well as a gao analysis of what additional enforcement tools may be necessary to provide sufficient deterrent especially to the most egregious and abusive junk fax senders again i want to commend chairman upton and chairman barton for their work on this bill and in particular for their willingness and openness in working with me and mr dingell in crafting the compromises needed to achieve consensus i encourage all the members to support it i yield back the

cqmpromise when appropriate there are two sectioni of this bill which i am particularly excited about from an acquisition policy point of view first is the section authorizing the continued use of energy savings performance contractsthese contracts have over recent years provided agencies with an effective tool to rapidly improve the energy efficiency of their buildings without increasing costs to the taxpayer some have suggested limitations to this program but such limitations will translate into reductions in the energy efficiency of government facilities in my opinion that is heading in the wrong direction and im happy to see such limitations were not included in the final bill second this legislation authorizes the use of other transactions for the department of energys critical research and development efforts these arrangements support research and development without using standard procurement contracts grants or cooperative agreements other transactions authority has been used successfully in the department of defense for years to great effect i appreciate the science committees willingness to work with me and the senate tocraft language that allows the use of this valuable tool where appropriate it is a shame when the government is denied a technological advance simply because our standard acquisition policies are not suitable for the development of cutting edge solutions finally i want to note that the conference has decided to include a request for a report on china and the cnooc offer to acquire unocal this report will be conducted simultaneously with the regular review conducted by the committee on foreign investments in the united states the report will essentially develop the same information required by the cfius review in other words the

responsible attempt to respond to the harsh economic realities facing our nation and our people but when we examineit objectively we cant avoid seeing the reality behind the pretense the bill is

veterans or helping americans raise themselves out of poverty or even protecting our country from the consequences of either national disasters or mounting national debt the authors and supporters of the legislation will tell us that if we wish to avoid increasing our national deficit which they have already driven to unprecedented heights we have no choice but to spend on the programs that americans rely on the most while they are busily cutting out the revenues that come into the government but once again they are offering a false choice for 5 years they have forced the massive tax cuts through the congress last week they made the most recent down payment on the cuts one was 70 billion while president bush signs that bill into law today republicans are asking us to pass this bill which adds another 158 billion to those cuts so in 2 weeks we have made those massive cuts and any justification melts away when we realize who is benefiting from it they are not for the poor they are not for the working class they are not for the middle class they are for the oil companies they wont spur our economy or help the average person afford their morning drive to work they are instead the cuts for billionaires and millionaires pure and simple they are not going to help the economy but they will indeed help people who dont need it and that assistance will come at the expense of everyone else but as always the case despite objections not just from democrats but much of the american public reducing or extending these cuts isnt even on the table here it never is they are considered too sacred to touch and just tonight in the rules committee once again we turned down an opportunity to pay for more by taking away part of their tax cut what do we get in exchange for this giveaway well the majority offered us a budget that will cut domestic spending between 1 and 2 percent every year as a result the party that tells us to support the troops is cutting veterans health care by 6 billion and we worry and fear for the over 20 000 young soldiers in iraq and afghanistan who have been grievously lifealtering wounded will not be able to get the care they need when they come back republicans who promised to leave no child behind will be cutting education funding by 45 3 billion and the budget of the department of education by 2 2 billion now not content to make education less rewarding in the present they apparently want to make our students worry more about loan payments in the future the bill eliminates all mandatory spending on student loans leaving congressional appropriators to somehow find 600 million to meet the students needs the majority wants to cut environmental protection efforts by 25 billion and take over 1 billion from community development and social service initiatives which we desperately need the poorest of the poor wont find any relief at all in this legislation in fact they will find the opposite the budget will underfund housing and child care assistance by 447 million over the next year and over 5 years the funding for them will fall almost 15 billion short what will the results be well consider the fate of the commodity supplemental food program which provides nutritious meals to 420 000 lowincome elderly and 50 000 mothers and children at a cost of 111 million a year the budget eliminates it entirely it may make sense that they are forcing the cuts through congress so they can afford the handouts to the rich but perhaps that really is what todays republican party stands for but apparently they also stand for something new contrary to their rhetoric irresponsible government spending the legislation before us will increase our deficit without a vote by 410 billion over the next 5 years at the same time it increases the debt limit by over 650 billion by 2011 the limit will stand at 9 6 trillion when the clinton administration left office the debt limit was about 4 5 trillion and they left

physician she is not on a respirator or other 24houraday medical equipment terri is responsive to stimuli such as voices touch and the presence of people she can move her head and establish eye

a physician who has cared for people in comas and who were considered in a persistent vegetative state i have some experience in determining the degree of incapacitation of disabled individuhls and it is a travesty to countenance the notion of putting her to death somehow because she is not able to speak terri and similar incapacitated people should be afforded the same constitutional protection of

nothing prohibits them from doing so the incapacitated persons legal protection act is needed because the state of the law on this topic needs to be clarified these cases are typically reserved for criminal cases in civil cases like terris the decision to even consider a habeas appeal is at the courts discretion the constitution in the 14t1 amendment however gives congress the express authority
