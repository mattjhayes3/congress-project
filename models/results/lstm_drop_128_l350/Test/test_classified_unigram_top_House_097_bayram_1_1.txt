crosscurrents that accompany national emergencies poland was so blessed in the person of cardinal stefan wyszynski a courageous prudent farseeing and temperate spiritual leader who adroitly headed the polish catholic church of some 30 million souls for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski

of detroit who was accompanied by the reverend stanley milewski chancellor of orchard lake schools orchard lake mich mrs helen zielinska president of the polish womens alliance and mr joseph drobot president of the polish roman catholic union of america the outpouring of sympathy we witnessed for this towering religious figure has left me with poignant and lasting memories it also has caused me to realize what a legacy he leaves behind the poland we see today in many ways is the result of his efforts therefore while saluting his memory i pray that whoever is chosen as the next primate of poland will be able to build upon the wyszynski legacy and in so doing move poland toward a permanent solution to its most difficult internal problems"], [0.0006252527236938477, 0.0006252527236938477,

rise in support of the conference report and urge its passage this bill has passed the house overwhelmingly on two occasions i am pleased to speak now on the successful conclusion of a very confused and unusual legislative course much of the departure from the normal process has been over a nongermane amendment about the public health service commission corps added to this bill by the other body after two meetings between the house and the senate conferees on this particular item it became clear that the amendment added in the other body was so flawed in its language that its legal effects were limited to persons already members of the corps and did not reach persons not already in the corps the cash discount act h r 31 originated in the house banking committee it passed the house on february 24 1981 it was amended on the senate floor with a nongermane amendment to the public health service act which is within the jurisdiction of the committee on energy and commerce when returned to the house the speaker referred the nongermane amendment to our committee until april 8 the health subcommittee held a hearing but the deputy assistant secretary of health and human services whose responsibilities include the service refused to testify this committee took no further action within the time allotted on april 8 the house asked for a conference on h r 31 and appointed conferees the senate appointed conferees on april 29 the senates amendment to the health act makes two related but permanent changes in law the first amends section 204 to authorize appointment of a person as surgeon general who is 64 or older the second waives the mandatory retirement provision of the act for the surgeon general only i wish to point out that last february the departments assistant general counsel was asked whether it would be permissible to make an original appointment in the regular corps of a person over age 64 in a memorandum opinion dated february 9 1981 the answer was an unequivocal no the general counsel said that section 207 a 3 of the actprohibits appointment in the regular corps or call to active duty in the reserve corps of a person age 44 or over unless he has had the number of years of prior service by which his age exceeds 44 or the secretary determines that he possesses exceptional qualifications not readily available in the corps for the performance of special duties with the service also he pointed out that section 211 a requires mandatory retirement of commissioned officers at age 64 the general counsel concluded even though the appointment limitation may be waived in an appropriate case there is no authority to waive the mandatory retirement provision the only provision for active duty after age 64 is the provision in section 211 c for recall to active duty in a retired status to appoint an individual who is subject to immediate retirement on the theory that he could then be recalled under section 211 c would be an obvious attempt to circumvent the requirement of the statute and would frustrate the intent of congress in imposing maximum retirement and appointment ages as you kiow there are comparable provisions in the other uniformed services as well as in the civil service and we are unaware of successful challenge to those provisions another provision of law requires an examination for persons appointed to the corps above the grade of junior assistant the president however may waive this to appoint with consent of the senate a limited number of persons between the grades of senior assistant and director dr julius richmond the former surgeon general received such an appointment however he was under the retirement age i agree withthe departments general counsel i also observe that 31 unitedstatesc 82c provides that a certifying officer is held accountable for and required to make good to the united states the amount of any illegal payment prohibited by law payment of anysalary to a person who does not meet the requirements of law if he were to be appointed surgeon general with the enactment of h r 31 only would be prohibited by law senate confirmation could not correct this because of the house instructions referred to in the conference report the conferees could make these other changes needed to appoint dr koop because as congressman madigan observed at the time of the house instruction

passed and the president has claimed his first victory i congratulate him on final passage i voted for the amended budget resolution because even though i have reservations about the presidents economic program i believed he should have the chance to make it work i think it is important however to take an honest look at what this fight in the house of representatives this week was all about members of the house were faced with a choice between two very austere budgetsthe recommendations of the house budget committee the socalled jones resolution and the recommendations of president reagan the grammlatta resolution both represented the essence of president reagans economic plan both of these budgets made deep cuts in a wide variety of social programs both recognized the need to control the growth of federal spending both provided substantial tax cuts to individuals and to businesses to stimulate economic growth each resolution provided for a 45 billion increase in defense spending both of these resolutions set a very conservative budget in my opinion with the adoption of either budget president reagan would have won his econoniic plan the jones budget called for slightly smaller cuts in important human investment programs such as education child nutrition and youth training it also provided a somewhat smaller tax cut but it also has a deficit smaller than president reagans the grammlatta budget made deeper cuts in domestic programs provided higher tax cuts and a larger deficit both proposals were essentially very conservative documentsboth recognizing the need to cut back on runaway government spending and the need to provide incentives for individuals and businesses to invest for economic growth and make our economy healthy again it is a fallacy to say that a vote for the jones budget is a vote against the reagan program the jones budget cut 31 billion in spending and provided 38 billion in tax cutswhile moving more rapidly toward a balanced federal budget it did not reflect more of the same the jones budget called for a substantial change in the role of the federal government it is a budget that was responsive to voters demands to slash government spending and it was fashioned after the goals set by prei ldent reagan there was really very little difference betw~een the two proposals considered by the houseyet the president sold his version as the only acceptable one in recent weeks i have read thousands of cards and letters and talked with hundreds of individual constituents on my weekends at home i thought long and hard over the comments i received from the people i represent they were pretty evenly divided therefore i made my decision to vote in favor of the jones budget on the basis that it is slightly better for the state of michigan and it is a more humane budget than the grammlatta budget last year michigan ranked dead last in its return of federal dollars on taxes paid by o ur citizens the primary reason for this is that national defense money flows predominantly to the sun belt states and the west the major increases in defense spending called for by president reaganand included in both the jones and grammlatta budgetswill mean that even more tax dollars will be diverted away from michigan at the same time that increased defense spending will be diverting more of michigans tax dollars out of our state those programs that have helped our stateand the people of our stateto get through our states present financial and economic crisis h 2042 c are being cut significantly we have the highest unemployment rate in the countryand that means that there are fewer tax revenues to finance services provided by local governmentssuch as education and law enforcementand fewer dollars for state programssuch as mental health care and child welfare programs at a time when financial constraints are forcing cutbacks in these services provided by our local and state governments the federal government is cutting its contributions to these same services leaving it to the states to make up the difference the state of michigan does not have the money these cuts will be realized and felt throughout the eighth district and michigan the jones budget would have been slightly less harsh for example the grammlatta budget cuts funding for education by 25 perent this will cost saginaw schools 2 4 million and bay city schools 1 million the jones budget would have cut education by only 10 percentstill a significant cut the same is true for health carethe grammlatta budget cuts the federal contribution by 25 percent jones would have cut it by 10 percent both proposals require cuts in the school lunch program the city of saginaw would lose 5 9 percent of its school lunch funds under jones but 18 6 percent under grammlatta the lapeer school district loses 22 7 percent of its funds under jones but 69 5 percent under grammlatta one out of ten in michigan receive food stamp assistance the grammlatta budget cuts food stamps by 1 65 billion the jones budget called for a 1 billion cut the difference means 20 million in food benefits to the people of michigan who are using the program because unemployment in our state is twice the national average i could go on but as i stated earlier both the jones and the grammlatta budgets were very austere budgets in line with the presidents goals both called for cuts in federal programs almost acrosstheboard cuts that are substantial neither was a budget that just cut welfare these budgets both cut deep into almost all government services and in michigan it means cuts not just in federal services but also in those services provided by the state and local governments despite the reports in the media president reagan could not have lost on this vote in the house of representatives whether the jones budget was adopted or whether the grammlatta budget passed the president would have received a budget that makes deep cuts in federal spending provides investmentoriented tax cuts and markedly increases defense spending furthermore it is important to remember that the passage of a budget in the house is not a final step even had the jones budget been adopted in the house the final budget would have been a compromise negotiated with the senate passage of the jones budget however would have left some negotiating room with the senate as to who will receive the greatest tax cuts and which programs will recieve the biggest budget cuts the cuts would be maderegardless of the action taken by the house this week my vote for jones honored my commitment to reduce federal spending and cut taxes i have serious reservations about whether the reagan plan will workwhether it really can bring down inflation increase economic growth and balance the federal budget by 1984 the plan makes some very boldand empirically unsupportablepredictions about savings rates growth employment and inflation rates in the next several years alreadyat least according to todays newspapersthe stock market is pessimistic about the presidents projections if these predictions prove wrong we could have higher inflation record budget deficits and aneconomy in worse shape than it is today the plan represents a gambleand we are told that we should accept in on faith i hope in fact i pray that this economic plan will work i

engineering changes have been made since the conceptual design was completed incorporating the latest technological developments and improvements in safety systems mechanical components core design and fuels second crbr is the most economical means of developing breeder technology by the turn of the century the site is now being cleared the design is 90 percent complete over 1 3 billion has been invested and 70 percent of the plant equipment is ready or on order third the crbr effort has assembled an impressive team of people and facilities which are at the forefront of american breeder reactor development 753 private utilities are partners in crbr development fourth the current total cost estimate from the department of energy for crbr is 3 6 billion including the 1 3 billion
