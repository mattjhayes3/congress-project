substitute for the feeling of satisfaction after a hard days work too often work is something that many people take for granted but one group of people who do not take work for granted is our seniors because of the social security earnings limit working seniors can literally not afford to take work for granted because of the social security earnings limit millions of working seniors are stripped of their social security benefits their crime is employment because they have a job the government takes away the social security benefits that they have spent a lifetime earning this is wrong this is not fair last week the house took the first step in giving relief to married couples who pay tax penalties because they are married now it is time to give relief to seniors who are penalized because

one more time run through what this budget proposal and outline does today because it is i believe the right combination and the right direction for our country although i will tell my colleagues right off the bat it spends too much but with what we are working with here with a narrow margin and a lot 6f diverse interests i think we have come up with a very good proposal first of all for the second year in a row the second time in 40 years we are not going to touch the social security surplus we are not going to take any money that is in surplus that comes in from the social security taxes to pay benefits for our seniors we are not going to take it and spend it on any other government program that means that that surplus is going to be available to fix social security for the baby boomers and their children so we will keep our mitts off of that secondly we are going to strengthen medicare with a prescription drug program and other medicare reforms we think that is important now we hear people on the other side of the aisle criticizing our medicare proposal the president first of all cuts medicare and secondly does not have a prescription drug program until 2003 i like to call it the somewhere over the rainbow program we believe we ought to get medicare reform and prescription drugs today and we are going to be unveiling our plan to strengthen medicare thirdly we are going to retire 1 trillion of the publicly held debt now for so long around here we talked about passing all this debt on to our children we are going to pay 1 trillion of the publicly held debt down and in fact we are on track if we wanted to to pay off the public debt by 2013 we are also going to strengthen education and science let me just make the point that some folks have said on this house floor that we do not do enough for pell grants well we have had a 50 percent increase in pell grant funding since 1995 when we took charge as you can see under a democrat president and democrat congress pell grants were not a priority but under the republican congress starting in 1995 we have significantly increased pell grants every single year now i know that some people say it is never enough but the fact is that we do in fact want to accomplish these other missions having to do with medicare and retiring debt and having a small tax cut at the same time i will get to that in a second for those who do not think we make education a priority in this budget they are wrong we significantly increase education primary and secondary and we continue our march to make pell grants more available but i would suggest to many of my colleagues whydo we not have a few conversations with these university presidents who cannot seem to control costs that are going up in higher education by far faster than the rate of inflation no matter what we do in this body we cannot solve the problems of the cost of higher education until we get some help on the side of the people who run these institutions who have not been able to manage costs but let there be no mistake we have increased the amount of money for pell grants in this congress by 50 percent in addition to our support of education and basic science a basic science program that we believe stresses programs like the human genome project which offers so much hope for everyone in this country for a healthier life for our families not just extend life but improve the quality of life with the major breakthroughs that are occurring by the ability to code the human gene they say that sometimes advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and the fact is when we think about efforts that go on today to decode the human gene system it is just remarkable we believe in basic science research in this house in addition to that we are promoting tax fairness for families and farmers and seniors let me talk a little bit about this we have a guarantee of 150 billion in tax cuts out of a 10 trillion budget i can only define that as puny the president today is going to say that that is too much of a tax cut well of course it is for the president he raises taxes but to cut 150 billion guaranteed out of a 10 trillion budget and to somehow say that is risky and out of line well sure it would be for somebody who thinks that we ought to just get our paychecks and send it all to the government of course they think that is too much but i tell you it is interesting when we have votes on things like repealing the earnings test tax so that seniors can be independent and not get penalized on their social security everybody votes for it when we put the elimination of the marriage penalty tax on the floor it is amazing the bipartisan support we get for that i will tell you another thing we bring a bill up here to reduce the inheritance tax the death tax on farms you watch the people that will vote on a bipartisan basis in this house because you know what the day you die you should not have to visit the irs and the undertaker on the same day the fact is that we need more tax relief i am disappointed we do not have four times as much tax relief in this bill because the american people know that america is strengthened from the bottom up not from the top down that in this new era bureaucracy and centralization is not the key in this new era it is the power of the individual to compute and to communicate and to reknit our families together in our schoolhouses in our churches in our synagogues and community organizations let us strengthen them not strengthen the power of the central government in a faraway place finally we are going to restore americas defense we are going to restore it because we do not think that our soldiers and sailors and airmen ought to be in a position where they are on food stamps where we have spread them out all over the world and not given them the tools they need to be an effective fighting force let us not forget that providing for the common defense is the number one priority of the central government we need to rebuild our nations defense and i hope at the same time to reform our nations defense i think we ought to come to this floor on a bipartisan basis and we ought to support a budget that saves social security that strengthens medicare and allows our seniors to have access to prescription drugs that reduces the publicly held debt by 1 trillion that gives our children a fighting chance to have a better tomorrow that strengthens the support for education and basic science that promotes tax fairness and reduces the tax burden h2250 cor on small business and families and family farms and restores americas defense establishment if we can accomplish all of that in one vote today we should have no reluctance on a bipartisan basis being able to support this we should come here with a firm eye and send a message to the american people that we are starting to get it we are starting to understand

to bring to everybodys attention the fact that today i am introducing a bill called the personal lockbox bill i think it is built on common sense because one of the things i have consistently heard from folks back home is the very simple idea that the first part of saving social security is making sure that social security taxes stay with social security that is what this bill does because it takes the social security surplus whatever h5850 co that happens to be and simply rebates it back to the people paying social security taxes not to go out and fix up the car or buy a refrigerator with it but instead to go into their own personal social security savings account that would be held by a fiduciary like the local bank the individual could not get their hands on the money until they turn

to address this house i rise in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the

tuesday on guam there will be a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the organic act many times unless one lives in a territory perhaps the term organic does not really mean much but organic act means it is an organizing act an act that organizes the local government pursuant to an act of congress so it was that on august 1950 president harry truman signed the guam organic act creating and making permanent a local civilian government providing for a locally elected legislature and providing for an independent judicial system that had a direct linkage into the federal court system and most importantly providing unitedstates citizenship for the people of guam the people that i represent this is the 50th anniversary of congressional action which brought an end to military government in guam a measure of real democracy to a group of loyal people of loyalty that had been just tested during a horrific occupation by enemy forces during world war ii and were therefore granted unitedstates citizenship the organic act was preceded by a very sustained effort on the part of the people of guam the islands leaders and many friends of guam and supportive persons in the united states here in congress and in the administration of president truman as well as president roosevelt and in the national media who at the time in the late 1940s people who took a direct interest of the affairs of what were to happen to dependent territories coming out of world war ii the organic act formally ended although it had ended a few months earlier by presidential action the congressional act entitled the organic act put an end to military government in guam a form of government meant to be temporary but which lasted some 50 years a military government a clearly unamerican form of government clearly undemocratic form of government in which the people of guam basically lived under the control of military officers whose primary duties were military in nature and whose secondary duties included the civil administration of a people that they saw as a dependent people as wards of the state clearly untenable and undemocratic form of government unfortunately many people in the military had continued to justify the continuing nature of this government by saying that guam had very strong strategic value for the united states and that therefore the people of guam should not enjoy too many civil and political rights under military government the people of guam were called unitedstates nationals under a military government government was created by fiats mandated by the naval governor of guam called general orders every time he wanted to make a law he simply called in a scribe they numbered these laws in consecutive order ranging from general order no 1 first promulgated in 1899 right up until the very end of naval rule some 50 years later one of those rules encapsulated the civil status of the people of guam and it was called general court martial order no 1923 held while the people of guam owed perpetual allegiance to the united states they are not citizens thereof nor is there any mechanism through which they could become citizens so as far as the navy was concerned the people of guam owed perpetual allegiance to the united states but they were not unitedstates citizens and more importantly there was no way that they could become unitedstates citizens that is probably the most outrageous general order in the whole series of general orders that were prosecuted on the people of guam throughout naval government that led to a citizenship movement this movement for unitedstates citizenship was seen in guam as the way to eliminate the vestiges of military government if one wanted to get rid of military government it was assumed that if people were declared unitedstates citizens that it would simply be untenable to continue to have military officers run the life of the island this citizenship movement was led originally by two men b j bordallo and f b leon guerrero during the 1930s they made a trip here into washington d c met with the president met with a number of congressional leaders to argue for a unitedstates citizenship for the people of guam the way that they funded their trip was to go through the villages of guam with a blanket that was carried at all four points and citizens and children would throw pennies and dimes and nickels into the blanket after doing this for a few months they were able to secure enough funds to fly the then china clipper to come here and spend several months making their case in washington d c they were able to a meet with president roosevelt and they were able to prevail upon two senators senator tydings from maryland and senator gibson from vermont who subsequently introduced a bill granting the people of guam unitedstates citizenship and it passed the senate that bill went to the house where it died on the basis of a congressional testimony made by secretary of the navy claud swanson that said the people of guam were living on too strategic a piece of real estate to be concerned with such things as civil and political rights subsequent to that of course the people of guam endured an occupation by the japanese during world war h coming out of world war i there was a renewed spirit here one had a war that was essentially fought to end tyranny and at the conclusion of the war there were a number of territories and dependencies that existed throughout the world so the united states and great britain and france and other countries that were on the victorious side of world war ii had then created the united nations in order to ensure a peaceful and stable world and introduced as part of the un charter article 73 which was meant to deal with nonselfgoverning territories that the countries that were responsible for these areas had a distinct responsibility to promote selfgovernment and selfdetermination for these nonselfgoverning territories the united states voluntarily placed a number of territories on those lists of nonselfgoverning territories to dramatize to the world how sincere the commitment was to end the whole nature of colonial government in the world also commensurate with this effort which was in the national consciousness and with the local citizenship movement there was an effort by citizens of the united states who were very friendly to the idea of civilian government for guam and citizenship for the people ofguam these people were led by an anthropologist by the name of dr laura thompson who founded the institute of ethnic affairs she worked very closely with her husband john collier and former secretary of the interior harold ickes and a couple of people in the media one was foster hailey with the new york times and richard wells an attorney who had formerly been stationed in guam right at the end of world war ii these people in turn worked towards generating media stories that appeared in colliers magazine saturday evening post a lot of very popular magazines at the time about what the exact conditions were in the territories both american samoa and guam but guam offered the more dramatic story in the meantime the navy tried to counteract this effort by instituting their own by assigning a number of officials to point out the blessings of military government all of this came to a head when the naval governor of guam the last naval governor by the name of admiral pownall was presiding over then a bicameral what was called the guam congress the house of council and the house of assembly there was a provision in the law at the time that said that in order to run a business on guam 50 percent of the ownership had to be of guamanian origin so that the people of guam would not be at the time subjected to undue competition from foreign sources but there was a civil service employee who was surreptitiously running a dress shop the assembly subpoenaed this individual by the name of abe goldstein he ran a dress shop called the guam style center they subpoenaed him to appear in front of the house of assembly mr goldstein conferred with the admiral and the admiral told him he did not have to appear in front of the assembly that the assembly had no power to subpoena anyone so the assembly became very upset and walked out and adjourned and said that they would not reconvene until it was made clear by the naval governor what the extent of their authority was information on this particular walkout was front page news in several newspapers including in san fancisco and honolulu and attracted a lot of attention this effort was coordinated by a man by the name of carlos taitano who is still very much with us today and who will be the principal celebrant of the guam organic act celebration next week carlos taitano at the time was a member of the guam assembly the leader of the walkout was a man by the name of antonio borja won pat who also had spent several months in washington after world war h advocating unitedstates citizenship for guam he was the speaker of the assembly the author of the walkout the speaker of the subsequent guam legislature after the institution of the organic act and eventually the first delegate to the unitedstates house of representatives from guam so mr won pat is probably the single most important political figure in the history of guam in the 20th century in november of 1949 there was a hearing in guam on legislation introduced this is pursuant to this walkout in march 1949 it was seen that something had to be done legislation was introduced in the house the public lands committee went to guam in november of 1949 had a hearing and in that hearing the main concern presented by the people of guam interestingly was land during the intervening time from the reinstitution of the navy military government of guam after world war ii the navy had acquired over a third of the island probably about 40 percent of the island closer to 40 percent and people were told that they were going to get their land back we have had this difficulty ever since and we are trying to resolve this in a comprehensive way that issue is still very much alive today and was part of a bill that was passed in the house earlier this week h r 2462 the guam omnibus opportunities act now the actual act that passed congress passed both the house and the senate was based on h r 7273 which was a modified form of the earlier version and it was introduced by congressman hardin peterson of florida in this final act it set up a system of government which we would call clearly undemocratic in todays terms but seemed very democratic at the time one it provided for a unicameral legislature of 21 members elected by the people of guam and limited to two 30day sessions a year within the organic act it provided for a local court system but if one had a felony case or a case involving more than 5 000 in a civil suit one had to go to a federal court so it established a federal district court so the scope of the local courts was limited even though it established a kind of independent judiciary of course the main feature of this organic act passed in 1950 was it did not have an elected governor what we had at the time was a governor that was appointed by the president so even though it was a civilian and was not a person in uniform and even though we had disestablished the naval military government of guam clearly there was much progress to be made but for 1950 now we are talking about 1950 this organic act of guam was seen as very progressive in the entire pacific compared to all the other territories which france and great britain had and some of the other islands in the pacific this looked like a very progressive step so indeed the organic act of guam in 1950 was highly regarded at the time and widely supported and of course the good feature the unique feature about it was the acquisition of unitedstates citizenship the first civilian governor of guam that was appointed by president harry truman was carlton skinner who was a young progressive governor who made a very skillful transition from military to civilian government he was a very important figure in the development of the organic act and the move from military to civilian government and he also will be joining us in guam on august 1 to commemorate the organic act but the politics of the environment changed along with elections to president and in 1952 with the election of president eisenhower a new governor was selected for guam a man by the name of fordq elvidge who wrote an article after he finished his term in the saturday evening postentitled i ruled uncle samsproblem child it was a very uncomfortable article to read nevertheless ford q elvidge allegedly had an experience which indicated how strong the military still was in guam he was appointed to be governor of guam but up until the year 1962 people could not go to guam and people could not leave guam unless the navy allowed them to leave or unless the navy allowed them to come in this was called military security clearance unless an individual had security clearance this act lasted all the way until 1962 it was started right at the beginning of 1940 as the situation between japan and the united states started to darken so this military security clearance executive order was declared by president franklin roosevelt well ford q elvidge as he boarded a plane to leave honolulu to come to guam to take over as governor was stopped by military officials who refused to let him go on the plane because he did not have the appropriate security clearance from naval authorities only pointing out how deeply rooted military authority was in the lives of the people after some discussion on the matter they finally relented and they allowed the governor of guam actually to go to guam so this situation existed in guam for another 20 years finally in 1968 an elective governorship bill passed the congress allowing thepeople of guam toelect a new governor the judicial system was simultaneously changed to expand the scope of the authority of the local court system and later on in 1970 and 1971 there were laws passed in the house of representatives to create the office of the delegate for the virgin islands and a delegate for the people of guam so after the completion of those elements it sort of completed the cycle and it certainly gave the sense that there was complete local selfgovernment in guam the people of guam elected their governor but this was still 20 years after the original organic act the people of guam elected a delegate to congress which gave them some opportunity to participate in the affairs of the house although of course in the final analysis there is no voting representation an interesting story when mr won pat first came as the first delegate there was some discussion in the initial house rules as to whether to pay him a full salary or not there was some discussion about that fortunately for all the successors to this office they agreed that they would pay the same salary as they pay other members of congress but it shows in a way the kind of stepbystep process but there was still something fundamentally incomplete about the organic act and that is that at the end of the day the organic act is not a local self constitution the organic act is an act of congress and every time we need to change portions of that act we have to come back to congress there is a provisionthat allows the people of guam to create a local constitution but to date that has only been exercised once and the proposed constitution was defeated because the people of guam felt strongly that there was still a more fundamental issue even than the creation of a local constitution and that is the exercise of selfdetermination as i indicated earlier the united nations system which was organized by the victorious powers coming out of world war ii in order to demonstrate that they were on the right side of democracy and to show that they meant democracy for everyone created a system called the nonselfgoverning territory system inside the united nations to this date guam and american samoa and the virgin islands remain on those lists of nonself governing territories because there has not been a full exercise of selfdetermination to decide in what direction they wish to go and what directions are made available to them by what is termed in the united nations language of thisrelationship the administering power so guam continues to be a nonselfgoverning territory it remains a nonselfgoverning territory because it does not have any voting participation in the laws that are applicable to them in any respect so an individual living in a territory and a law is passed here on the endangered species act or a law regarding the regulation of land or the law regarding taxation and that law has some applicability to that person it violates the very first tenet of the american creed which is government by the consent of the governed and there is no consent to governance now one can argue that there is a sense of participation that there is some level of involvement but at the end of the day there is no real consent of the governed and of course people in the territories do not vote for the president though of course he is our president as much as he is the president of any other american and we go off to war just like we go off to war with other americans as well and he is our commander in chief today at the end of the day and some 50 years having elapsed since the passage of the organic act many see the organic act in guam as reflective of past events and to some extent past political traumas as seen as evidence of continued federal control of guam as seen as passe at worst maybe transitional at best but i believe that that is looking backward forgetting the sweet victory that the organic act represented in 1950 it was the kind of progress that was possible at the time and it was progress that many people worked hard to achieve it took many people to get us to that point and we must not forget the efforts of those very hard working sincere persons from guam as well as their friends here in washington d c who brought genuine political progress to guam we must not forget that they slain real dragons they overcame real barriers and they brought down a systemof military government that in the final analysis did not really want to leave so the organic act while it is properlyseen in its historical development for the island i represent is certainly not the magna carta for guam or the declaration for guam or not even the constitution for guam but it is an important document that embodied a fundamental shift of government from people in uniform to people in civilian clothes a document that embodied the principle that there should be some consent of the governed over laws that are made locally that embodied and most importantly recognized the loyalty of the people of guam through an horrific occupation and finally declared them to be unitedstates citizens en masse at this time that we recognize this very important anniversary for the people of guam we must be mindful of the fact that there are still many tasks ahead of us but at least let us remember august 1 1950 and on august 1 2000 take time and reflect upon our past history the work of such great people in my own islands history like antonio borja won

federal government can serve as a stimulus and by providing some of the money stimulate and embarrass the states and the local governments into doing far more the estimate is that we need about 320 billion just to take care of infrastructure needs for the current enrollment without projecting future enrollment that is the estimate of the national education association one might say they are a teacher organization they are biased well the education commissioner recently came up with a statement that 127 billion is needed some years ago 1994 the general accounting office said we needed 110 billion then the need is great we are going to improve education the least we can do is take care of the highlyvisible infrastructure problems it does not require the federal government getting

"i would say to the gentleman from new jersey he has been a cosponsor from the beginning we have worked very hard on the democratic side of the aisle to try to develop proposals that would be meaningful to all seniors al gore has the same kind of approach that we need a medicare prescription drug benefit that is voluntary so no one is forced into it but is universal it will basically provide coverage for everyone who wants it i thought what i would like to do tonight is talk a little bit about some of the arguments that are out there i was reading an article several months ago an article written several months ago before i came over and it was an article by a commentator who was saying that if you think there is no difference between the republicans and the democrats on prescription drugs you are not paying attention this election matters a great deal because these two approaches are so very different from each other we had our colleague the gentleman from ohio down here a little bit earlier this evening and he was reminding us that we found this republican pollsters suggestion several months ago recommending that the republicans come up with a plan it did not really matter what kind of plan it was as long as they could say they had a plan and that would be enough to get them through the election but that is the fundamental difference the fundamental difference here is that democrats are saying we need to have a plan that is voluntary that is universal and that has a guaranteed prescription drug benefit in addition we are saying we have got to do something about price we have to create some leverage some downward pressure on price we are not talking about setting prices we are talking about bargaining power using medicare using health and human services to get lower prices for seniors who right now pay the highest prices in the world on the other side the republicans are trying to do everything they can not to strengthen medicare to make sure that if we have any sort of prescription drug legislation at all the one thing it will not do is strengthen medicare what is the reason for that medicare is a government health care plan it covers everyone over 65 and many of our disabled citizens but the fear on the republican side is that they know people like medicare trust medicare want medicare to be stronger better to be sure but they like it and trust it and they are afraid that somehow if the program is even better that will be a problem for those who are trying to diminish medicares influence in this health care system so i want to talk a little bit about the language that is out there one thing the republican pollster recommended is that they should attack democratic plans as being onesizefitsall plans you hear that phrase on the other side of the aisle all the time now onesizefitsall so the proposal that they make is they say are designed to provide choice when governor bush made his proposal for socalled medicare reform the word choice appeared in his statement many many times the word hmo never appeared in his statement but the choice that he was talking about was going to come from letting hmos come into medicare and the government would provide some subsidy to hmos in order for them to perhaps if they wanted and if it were profitable enough provide some kind of private insurance for seniors that is not a plan that will work for seniors and it is disguised it is all wrapped up in language of choice when it is really all about letting insurance companies and hmos have a much bigger role in medicare as it stands today you can see ads out there run by the folks on the other side of the aisle that talk about a big government hmo the al gore plan the democratic plan is a big government hmo well guess what there is no such animal hmos are private insurance companies most of the biggest ones are forprofit private insurance companies there are some that are nonprofits but as we know the forprofits tend to be gaining the most ground and gobbling up some of the smaller ones but that kind of deception is really what we have got to deal with we have got to be explaining to people all the time that there is no such animal as a big government hmo there is just medicare and you can trust it you can rely on it it is there for you it does not change from year to year to year whereas when you turn to managed care plans under medicare and we have some we have about somewhere between 14 and 15 percent of seniors now covered by some kind of managed care and just now two of them are my parents my parents back in maine are two of about 1 700 people on a medicare managedcare plan in the state of maine out of all our several hundred thousand seniors we have 1 700 seniors on a medicare managedcare plan and guess what as of december 31 the private company that provides that insurance is leaving the state of maine we will have no medicare managed care in maine guess what the reason is basically it is just not profitable if you want to rely for prescription drug benefits on companies who will come and go in your state in your community depending on whether or not they can make a profit that is no assurance at all that is not security at all it is not equitable at all but that is what you get with these republican plans which are essentially subsidies to the insurance companies to do what can be more cheaply done more equitably done more fairly done through our health care plan for the elderly called medicare that is the real division between the parties on this subject what we are also seeing now on the other side of the aisle is a whole series of efforts we passed the plan over here that was a straightout subsidy to the insurance companies that passed by three whole votes it is obviously not going anywhere because it does not have broad bipartisan support then we hear about other plans maybe we could do a program to give money to the states only for the poorest people who are not covered now the trouble is that over half of all the people who do not have prescription drug coverage have incomes above 175 percent of the poverty line middleclass seniors are struggling with prescription drug bills that can be 200 300 400 600 800 a month i have talked to them in my district i have talked to people who have coverage now through a private plan and they are in their sixties i was talking to one couple in waterville maine and between the husband and the wife both of them shave insurance now but they lose it when they turn 65 they are 63 or so their cost for prescription drugs alone will be somewhere around 800 to 1 000 a month and they do not know how they are going to do it the problem gets worse year after year because the one thing we know about next year is next year spending on prescription drugs is going to be 15 percent at least higher than it is this year just as this year it is 15 percent higher than it was last year what we can see here is fundamental the most profitable industry in this country charges the highest prices in the world to the people who can least afford it many of whom are our seniors seniors are 12 percent of the population but they buy onethird of all prescription drugs the gentleman from new jersey knows from talking to people in his district as i know talking to people in maine they can barely get by and often they do not often they simply do not get by so what troubles me most about this is all of the misinformation that is out there all of the tv ads that are being run by republican candidates talking about a big government hmo or onesizefitsall plan which is basically designed to deceive because the truth is that medicare is a plan which covers everyone but it is also true that we can design and we have designed a medicare prescription drug benefit which is voluntary you do not have to sign up for it but which will be a real strong start on making sure that seniors get the prescription drugs that they need i just want to say how much i appreciate the good work that the gentleman is doing to bring us down here night after night after night to try to clear the air to try to contain the rhetoric and to try to convey to the american people some sense of the fundamental differences between plans like the republican plans that rely on insurance companies and plans like ours that cover everyone that are fair and equitable and cost effective and work through medicare i guess the last thing i would say is this it is not just the ads that are out there being run by the republican nominee for president or others the pharmaceutical industry is out there running more television ads perhaps the latest projection suggestions more television ads more money than any industry has ever run in any election until now citizens for better medicare which is sort of the front group for the pharmaceutical industry they are not citizens and they are not for better medicare the pharmaceutical industry is running ads trying to defeat the discount for seniors contained in my bill the medicare prescription care benefit contained in the democratic proposal or even our bills led by the gentleman from arkansas or the gentleman from vermont those bills that are designed to try to allow drugs to be imported into the united states and then sold by pharmacies here because medicines can be purchased so much more cheaply in canada mexico in fact anywhere else in the world than in these united states let us always remember that these are drugs manufactured by american companies and they sell for 60 percent more here than they do in canada in europe and everywhere just on average and we have got to change this we have simply got to keep persisting that we are not going to allow the american people to be fooled and we are not going to accept this rhetoric about onesizefits all or big government hmos or people who say that we are going to give a choice of plans when all they are really talking about is giving an hmo that can pull that choice any time it wants to any plan it wants to so i just want to say thank you to the gentleman from new jersey who is doing a great job pounding away on this issue night after night and i am convinced that if we cannot get it this month we will get a medicare prescription drug benefit for our seniors in the next 2 years this issue is too big it is too important and we simply cannot let it slide away we cannot let this whole area be taken over by private insurance companies hmos and the pharmaceutical industry i

the amendment in the nature of a substitute i will not repeat the arguments i made during the general debate as to why the underlying legislation is very necessary i think the vast majority of the members of this house agree with that proposition the real question is whether it is appropriate to ensure that this legislation once enacted while providing an effective shield for the religious rights of all americans will not be used as a sword against the civil rights of other americans i believe the amendment in the nature of a substitute strikes that balance and does so without doing violence to the underlying purpose of the bill members who support this legislation need not be concerned that the substitute will nullify its protections in any way it is no secret there is substantial concern that establishing a standard that says a state and local law cannot be enforced in any case where someone raises a religious claim unless the state can show a compelling interest in enforcing its law in the specific case causes concerns about whether religious claims will prevail against state and local civil rights laws the committee on the judiciary has received testimony from some supporters of this bill who have testified very forthrightly that they have and will continue to bring free exercise litigation in an effort to undermine some civil rights protections while those religious beliefs may be sincere and entitled to a fair hearing i think it is necessary to strike an appropriate balance without broad carveouts and without politicizing the process if that is possible the amendment recognizes that religious rights are rights that belong to individuals and to religious assemblies and institutions general motors does not have sincerely held religious beliefs by its nature my amendment protects individual and religious institutions in order to protect civil rights laws against the person who would say my religion prohibits me from letting my corporation hire a divorced person or a disabled person or a mother who should be at home with her children or a gay or a lesbian person and it prohibits me from letting my hotel rent a room to such people never mind the state civil rights laws that prohibit this kind of discrimination in order to protect civil rights laws against that sort of religious claim the amendment places some limits on who may raise a claim under this bill against the application of a state or local law any person would have standing any person would have standing under this amendment to raise any claim with respect to any issue with the following narrow exceptions except a claim against the housing discrimination law could be raised only by a small landlord who was exempted by the terms of the fair housing act a claim against an employment discrimination law could be raised only by a small business with five or fewer employees in accord with the general practice of exempting very small businesses from employment discrimination laws or by a church or other religious institution or religious school exercising its right to decide whom to employ based on its religious beliefs with these exceptions businesses of any size could bring any free exercise claims this is important for the mom and pop store that has difficulties with sunday closing laws or with laws allowing malls requiring stores to remain open 7 days a week as well as for large firms that for example produce kosher meat or other products the amendment recognizes that in protecting any rights we are always balancing other peoples rights the courts do it we do it and there is no way around it i think this amendment accomplishe that end i can tell the members that a great deal of work and consultation both with members of the religious coalition which is supporting this bill and with other civil rights groups has gone into developing this language it provides a basis to enact a bill that will pass and that will protect people who are in need of protection i know there are those who will object that this amendment is a carveout a set of exceptions to a general religious protection principle that will set a precedent for many more exceptions and could lead to gutting of the bill to rendering our first freedom a hollow shell i disagree in the first instance this bill already has a carveout that breaks the absolute the principle of indivisibility that we must never have carveouts this bill limits the right of prison inmates to raise otherwise valid claims under the bill by specifically referencing the prison litigation reform act so we already have a carveout in the bill this is simply a second carveout the question is not should we have a carveout but is it important worthwhile and valid i submit that to protect civil rights laws from possible claims under this bill it is a valid protection secondly it is not a carveout in the sense that for instance the prison carveout is where it simply says this shall not apply by reference or this shall not apply to this or that law it is a limitation a narrow limitation on standing which would be very difficult to extend further and which should not be extended any further i believe that without good faith compromise by people with vastly different beliefs it would be difficult to get this bill through the senate through the house and through the president that was our experience with rfra and nothing has changed this amendment provides an opportunity to find the consensus we need to protect the rights of all americans if we could not draft this amendment if we had a stark choice in which we said we can either protect the free exercise of religious rights of people from the damage the supreme court has done to it at the expense of the civil rights of other americans or we can protect the civil rights of americans but not their religious rights that would be a terrible choice indeed this amendment offers us a way to do both protect the religious liberties we need to protect as the gentleman from florida and others have so eloquently expressed but do so without violating or posing a threat to civil rights of americans we ought to do it in the proper way without posing a threat to the civil rights of americans i therefore urge my colleagues to adopt this substitute amendment and reluctantly if the substitute is not adopted i will urge my colleagues to vote against the bill so that we can have further in the process better odds of getting this amendment or something like this into the bill i reserve the balance of my

uncomfortable about that but i think it is also a complicated question i have concerns about the motion of the gentleman from oklahoma and actually there are a number of reasons first of all because i am not necessarily convinced that the best approach in my city my hometown would be the best approach in new york or san francisco or lexington kentucky or other communities or vice versa and i think one of the problems with the coburn motion is that it gets in the way of local people being able to decide how they want to handle a very sensitive problem secondly i think you do have conflicting views about which approach actually saves the most lives and prevents the most abortions and i suspect that what the answer is to that question again depends on the community morals and practices and culture and so while i understand those who say that they find issues like this distasteful and sometimes they get in fact angry i really wonder whether it is wise for the congress to tell local

means we are trying to keep as much language off appropriation bills as possible and it seems to me that to the extent that these riders are attached which are legislative in nature they get in the way of our ability to finish our work hefore the end of the fiscal year and that causes all kinds of turmoil and also frankly if we are going to start making motions to instruct on this bill then a

lower sugar prices they buy a lot of sugar and those of us that support agriculture we hear well there is a different policy here for sugar than there is for anything else which is not true this is not part of the amta payments we do not pay the farmers directly what we do in america is we limit the number of imports and we give preference to countries that we are trying to help particularly in the caribbean basin and central america allow their sugar products to come in mostly cane sugar what do we do we pay the price that we get for sugar in america which is a better price than they get on

subcommittee on asia and the pacific this member rises in opposition to the resolution it is important for us i think to recognize what the jacksonvanik waiver does and what it does not do by law the underlying issue here is about immigration based on vietnams record of progress on immigration and its continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver will continue to promote freedom of immigration disapproval would undoubtedly result in the opposite the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations 5 years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationships this is in americas own shortterm and longterm national interests it builds on vietnams own policy of political and economic reintegration into the world this will be a lengthy and challenging process however now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam vietnam continues to cooperate fully with our priority efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting of american powmias the jacksonvanik waiver supports this process the jacksonvanik waiver certainly does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion on may 4 however this body passed a resolution condemning just such violations of human rights the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate and sign a new bilateral commercial trades agreement with vietnam congress will have an opportunity in the future whether to approve it or not and whether to grant ntr or not but that is a separate process the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver only keeps this process going nothing more renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not antomatically make american exports to vietnam eligible for possible coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs the waiver only allows american exports to vietnam to be eligible for such coverage the war with vietnam is over and we have embarked upon a new although cautious expanded relationship with vietnam now is not the time to reverse this constructive course accordingly this member urges a no vote on the resolution having summarized the key reasons to oppose the resolution this member would like to expand on a few of these points first the issue of emigration which indeed is what the jacksonvanik provision is all about since march of 1998 the united states has granted vietnam a waiver of the jacksonvanik emigration provisions of the trade act of 1974 as this is only an annual waiver the president decided on june 2 2000 the renew this extension because he determined that doing so would substantially promote greater freedom of emigration from that country in the future this determination was based on vietnams record of progress on emigration and on vietnams continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year as a result we are approaching the completion of many refugee admissions categories under the orderiy departure program odp including the resettlement opportunity for vietnamese returnees former reeducation camp detainees mccain amendment subprograms and montagnards the vietnamese government has also agreed to help implement our decision to resume the odp program for former unitedstates government employees which was suspended in 1996 the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver is an acknowledgment of that progress disapproval of the waiver would undoubtedly result in vietnams immediate cessation of cooperation second the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations five years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationship this policy is in americas own short and longterm national interest it builds on vietnams o n policy of political and economic reintegration into the world in the judgment of this member this will be a lengthy and challenging process however he suggests that now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam third over the past five years vietnam has increasingly cooperated on a wide range of issues the most important of these is the progress and cooperation in obtaining the fullest possible accounting of americans missing from the vietnam war those members who attended the briefing by the distinguished ambassador to vietnam a former prisoner of war and former member of this body the honorable pete peterson learned of the significant efforts to which vietnam is now extending to address our concerns regarding the pow mia issue including their participation in remains recovery efforts which are physically very dangerous fourth the jacksonvanik waiver does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion however our experience has been that isolation and disengagement does not promote progress on human rights new sanctions including the symbolic disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver only strengthens the position of the communist hardliners at the expense of those in vietnams leadership who are inclined to support more openness engagement with vietnam has resulted in some improvements in vietnams human rights practices though we still remain disappointed at the very limited pace and scope of such reforms as this member mentioned on may 4 2000 this body adopted a resolution condemning vietnams human rights record given the strong reaction to our resolution by hanoi it is evident that our actions and concems did not go unnoticed fifth the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with any new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status however with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate a new bilateral commercial trade agreement with vietnam this agreement was signed two weeks ago in washington in the opinion of this member this agreement is in our own short and long term national interest vietnam remains a very difficult place for american firms to do business vietnam needs to undertake additional fundamental economic reforms this new bilateral trade agreement will require vietnam to make these reforms and will result in increased american exports supporting jobs here at home in a separate process with a separate vote congress will have to decide whether to approve or reject this new trade agreement and to grant ntr status to vietnam given that the agreement has yet to even be transmitted to congress and there are only a limited number of legislative days before the bodys scheduled adjoumment this member believes that these decisions will not be made until the 107th congress meets next year thus the jacksonvanik waiver simply ensures that the modest trade opportunities currently available to american businesses will continue until congress considers the agreement sixth contrary to the claims of some opponents of the jacksonvanik waiver renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not automatically make american investment in and exports to vietnam eligible for coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs such as those administered by the overseas private investment corporation the exportimport bank and the unitedstates department of agriculture the waiver only allows american exports and investments to be eligible for such coverage each must still face separate individual reviews against each programs relevant criteria americans must conclusively recognize that the war with vietnam is over with the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1995 the united states and vietnam embarked on a new relationship for the future it will not be an easy or quick process vietnam today remains a communist country with very limited freedoms for its citizens significant reforms must occur before relations can be truly normal the emotional scars of the vietnam war remain with many americans in the mid1960s this member was an infantry officer and intelligence officer with the first infantry division within a month of completing my service members of my tightknit detachment of that division were in vietnam and taking casualties the first night after arrival like other vietnamera veterans this member has emotional baggage a great many americans have emotional baggage about vietnam but this member would suggest that it is time to get on with our bilateral relationship and not reverse course on vietnam passing this resolution of disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver would represent yet another reflection of animosities of the past at a time when vietnam is finally looking ahead and making changes towards its integration into the international community a retrenchment on our part by this disapproval resolution is not in americas short and long term national interests accordingly this member strongly urges the rejection of

body that could have the potentially destructive effects of cutting off important exchanges between american scientists and their counterparts from other countries the legislation in question offered by senator shelby would impose a moratorium on visiting scientists from socalled sensitive countries in american nuclear labs the senators proposal comes on the heels of recent reports of compromises to our national security with regard to the peoples republic of china while i agree that chinese espionage activities should cause us to be more vigilant with regard to that country i am concerned that this proposed legislation casts a wide net and would give too much discretion to officials at the department of energy the result could be a cutting off of positive scientific exchanges that do not affect our national security depriving all of us of valuable knowledge and disrupting the types of scientific contacts that actually promote security and cooperation one country that could be affected by this legislation is india while the senate legislation does not mention any countries by name a recent report in the newspaper india abroad quotes an energy department official that the list of seven sensitive countries includes in addition to china and russia india and pakistan the official indicated that different criteria were used for putting countries on the list and that india and pakistan were included because they are not signatories to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty i too am deeply concerned about the persistent pattern of chinas theft of our nuclear secrets i have come to this floor on several occasions to call for more safeguards against chinese espionage as well as to focus more attention on chinas documented actions with regard to nuclear proliferation which include providing nuclear and missile technology to unstable countries like pakistan but in the case of india we clearly do not have the facts to support the conclusion that india is involved in the same types of activities as china thus i would urge members of the senate and the house as well as the administration not to jump to any conclusions about india without the facts what we know is that unitedstates india relations have suffered in the past year because of the nuclear tests conducted by india last may but one key fact that is often overlooked is that indias nuclear program is essentially indigenous developed by indias own scientists export controls on supercomputers and other dual use technology have been in effect against india for years forcing india to develop its own highly advanced r d infrastructure another very important point is that india has kept its nuclear technology to itself out of the hands of rogue regimes and international sponsors of terrorism this is in marked contrast to china which has not only stolen our technology but has shared very sensitive information with unstable countries in asia and the middle east i fully agree that we need to be

legislation protects individuals and businesses from having to pick up the tab for irresponsible debtors debtors who are capable of paying off a significant portion of their debts this bankruptcy reform bill establishes a clear causal link between a debtors ability to pay and the availability of chapter 7 bankruptcy superdischarge it requires those who can afford to pay their debts to honor their commitments let me emphasize at the outset that individuals who make below the median income will not be forced into chapter 13 under this bill although they may still voluntarily choose to file there what this bill does do is require individuals who make above the median income and are determined to have significant repayment capabilities to file in chapter 13 there are people who truly have a legitimate need to declare bankruptcy no one is denying this at times hardworking people come up against special circumstances that are beyond their control family illness disability or the loss of a spouse may necessitate the need to seek relief this legislation effectively protects these individuals too frequently however people who have the financial ability or earnings potential to repay their debts are simply seeking an easy way out of repaying debts while this may prove convenient for the debtor it is not fair to their friends and neighbors who are ultimately stuck with the bill estimates show that the average american pays as much as 550 per year as a bad debt tax in the form of higher prices and increased consumer credit interest rates to cover the economic costs associated with the excessive bankruptcy filings of others nationally consumer bankruptcies reached a record 1 4 million in 1997 and those numbers have remained high what makes these statistics particularly alarming is the fact that this trend began in 1994 during a time of solid economic growth low inflation and low unemployment during an unprecedented peacetime boom in our economy the primary culprit of this dramatic increase in bankruptcy filings is a system that allows consumers to evade personal responsibility for their debts under this legislation individuals who can pay their debts will be

tonight is an issue of great importance in my home community of onondaga county in which the city of syracuse resides and i have represented now for 10 years in the congress when i first came to washington back in 1988 we had the unfortunate distinction of having one of the highest infant mortality rates in the country in 1987 87 newborns died before they reached their first birthday over the 1987 to 1989 period an average of 68 infants in the county or 10 out of every thousand died again before they reached their first birthday these are horrifying statistics and what makes it even worse is that the proportion of these deaths fell most heavily upon the minority community last year we through now 10 years of concerted work and effort and coordination and caring we have some excellent news to report while even one death is unacceptable we have succeeded in reducing our infant mortality rate in onondaga county by over 50 percent this remarkable change did not happen without a concerted effort a number of devoted people and organizations contributed i have always felt that the best government will sponsor a partnership between local state and federal governments and special initiatives undertaken by local communities and the private sector and in central new york we proved this to be the case the efforts which have been successful in reducing the number of infant deaths in onondaga county began in the early 1990s as a member of the select committee on children youth and families i encouraged and was successful in bringing a former colleague of mine from new york mack mchugh and others to hold a field hearing for that committee in syracuse back in 1990 we had witness testimony from public health officials physicians nurses and parents about strategies for insuring healthy babies in upstate new york as a result of these hearings a number of projects were undertaken in the county with the goal of reducing infant death and increasing birth weight at the time of birth since that time a number of these projects have proved to be very effective in dealing with infant mortality dr jim miller and his successors including dr lloyd novick commissioner of health in onondaga county should be credited for the innovative efforts to address this issue by creating initiatives to reduce the instance of infant mortality and low birth weight babies one of these programs is called healthy start it works to reduce both infant mortality and adolescent pregnancy adolescent pregnancy and infant mortality are interrelated births to young women who are not physically or psychologically prepared to give birth or to adequately raise the child adolescents often cannot provide the care necessary to ensure the health of infants and often get into the system too late healthy start realizes that by addressing the issue of teen pregnancy the instance of infant mortality can be dramatically reduced low birth weight as we know is a key factor in the health of newborns and all efforts were targeted toward healthy pregnancies and early intervention healthy start is dependent on the work of many partners in the local community hospital staff university health professionals case workers local schools task forces all can provide health education and care to adolescents and their parents and must include state county and federal health agencies and officials doctor sandy lane is the syracuse healthy start project director she and her staff are to be commended for the committed efforts that they have made she has been very modest about her programs ability to create the success she credits involvement of local groups partner agencies and the help of the health department programs and strongly praises the important federal program wic women infant children the feeding program to provide nutrition for both women and those children syracuse healthy start funding is a combination of federal state and local funding over 4 and a half million dollars of federal money have come in to the program through the department of health and human services the health resources and service administration healthy start also looks to blue cross and blue shield and to new york state department of health to obtain supplemental funds the program has been largely successful because of these efforts another such program is the adolescent risk reduction
