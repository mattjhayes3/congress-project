want to do is raise the governments borrowing limit recklessly killing jobs liberals in congress need to attach real cuts to any increases they are seeking that means for every dollar proposed to

this will be miles and miles and miles i want to be very clear the levee will be there its going to be there the only thing were doing here is right now the federal government when there is a flood pays for this the federal government shares in the cost to build a temporary levee a month later they pay for it to tear it down time and time again if youre concerned about the environment or youre concerned about disruption this is where we need to have that part of a levee system a permanent levee system thats already in place that has very little impact on the environment as we can work

opposed to s 2039 a bill that is on the suspension calendar for a vote today this bill would allow communities in north dakota to construct levees on land that was so floodprone that federal taxpayers bought out the property owners on the condition of no future development construction of the levees will inevitably lead to more high risk development and future costs to taxpayers in short the taxpayer will be forced to pay twice or more the federal emergency management agency hazard mitigation grant program hmgp enables voluntary buyouts of frequently flooded property and to prevent future losses and costs to the federal government the communities agree not to develop the property in the future instead of rectifying specific instances where problems with the program may have arisen or pursuing other solutions this bill applies broadly across the state of north dakota in fact while this legislation is specifically targeted at north dakota the bill would set a precedent that could have national implications and it would trigger potentially significant future costs that would be avoided by simply not building on the land as was originally agreed in fact taxpayers would be subsidizing the levee construction by purchasing the land which would enable the future levee project and the local costsharing partner to avoid real estate fees a costly pattern could develop the federal taxpayer buys the property and a short while later the community opts out of the program and builds a levee on the ``free land we urge you to oppose s 2039 this controversial bill should not

nucleararmed pakistan but does anyone believe the war in afghanistan has made pakistan more stable these are not my words again these are the words of eugene robinson whos nationally known and

failed policy with cuba where we have had massive efforts at sanctioning cuba a little tiny island off the american coast and what we have done most independent experts agree is that we have propped up castro we have given him a reason if we had been freely trading and interacting with the cuban people i think castro would have been a thing of the past being careful about what we do with iran

the federal government from the older americans act so that she is incorruptible unassailable and thank god untouchable she presented me with a series of letters she wrote to attorney general eric

describing how local seniors are being pressured and intimidated into signing over their property for the pipelines supposed unapproved rightofway mrs lopez leon believes that repetitive violations of

false pretext of measuring a nonexistent rightofway illegal trespassing into the homes of the elderly with the fraudulent pretense to generate a written authorization from the elderly to allow and permit a consented purchase of the property to the commonwealth of puerto rico and the energy company well below market value of the property without granting the elderly the opportunity to seek counsel a recent appraisal or to contest the eminent domain procedure which they are threatened with if they do not grant a voluntary consent to sell their properties these 41 affidavits are from four towns on the route of the proposed gasoline adjuntas penuelas utuado and toa baja i would like to first talk about one of them because i will read some short translations from some chilling stories

of the energy company constantly fly over my residence and they do so at a low altitude disturbing my tranquility since my home is built of tin and wood as you see in the picture when the helicopters hover my entire house trembles that has generated much anxiety in me and for this reason i had to visit my primary doctor and have had to take medication for my nerves and my heart condition has even worsened then there is lucrecia maldonado rentas she is 82 years old and is pictured in front of her house with her sister gloria she says the letters i received were written to pretend to be a study to be conducted on the needs of the population and it ended up being one about natural gas the pipeline and the expropriation process of the barrio portugues community in adjuntas puerto rico in them

last year mr guzman does not know how to read and can barely write 1l 1010 he does not need to fully be educated however to know the difference between right and wrong if only choosing between right and wrong would come that easy to the ruling party of puerto rico i want to make it clear to you and to this body and to attorney general eric holder that these are not powerful men and women they are not legal scholars or real estate experts but they have made simple pleas to the court and their complaints should be heard they are worried that they will lose their homes and they will lose their

going to war is a big deal thats why our forefathers put within the constitution that when america is to go to war it is congress that is to lead that charge that it is congress to authorize americas going to war that has been the law in the constitution since it was written then came the war powers resolution and congress decided that it would give a little of that constitutional authority to the president for a period of days until he justified his action before congress we can argue whether the war powers resolution is constitutional or not but in any event congress has not led america to war in libya the president has the president made that decision as james madison the author of the constitution said in a letter to thomas jeffersonand i paraphraseit has been the history of peoples that it has been the executive branch that has led a country to war and thats why our constitution prevented kings and dictators and even presidents from leading this country to war it must be authorized by congress but now we find ourselves in americas third warin libya the president took us to war now on this day we are being asked to support and justify that war in this resolution i vote

already been spent on the war in libya its hard to figure out where that money came from i get different answers from different people about where the president got that money maybe we should spend that 700 million in the united states building america rather than blowing up libya i think that would be a better use of funds we need to take care of america we shouldnt be involved in somebody

leadership of our house that the american people must be engaged in the constitutional duties that have been set out for the three branches of government under the constitution the war powers are divided between congress and the president and among other relevant grants congress has the power to declare war and raise and support armed forces while the president is the commander in chief the congressional duties fall under article 1 section 8 and the commander in chief can relate his or her duties to article 2 section 2 it is generally agreed that the commander in chief role gives the president power to utilize the armed services to repel attacks against the united states but there has long been a challenge or controversy over whether he or she is constitutionally authorized to send forces into hostile situations abroad without a declaration of war or congressional authorization and so here we are today indicating that it is important for the commander in chief no matter how much respect there is to be able to respond to the call of the congress there are now two resolutions that swirl around the violence and horrific acts in libya compounding the problem is a continued violence an assault on the people of libya so for a moment let me focus on general qadhafi to ask him the question is he reasoned and does he recognize that the slaughter of his people must stop the president of south africa engaged in peace talks with general qadhafi and many of us thought that the white flag would be raised and that there would be an opportunity for resolution we see that not coming so my message to general qadhafi is to stop this senseless and violent war to allow your people to accumulate the privileges of human dignity that is to be able to live in peace and hopefully to secure democratic rights for themselves but at the same time we in the united states cannot stand by and watch as violence proceeds we must have procedure we must have process i believe the boehner amendment gives at least some tracking as to what you are asking the president for but i still quarrel with the debate and the question as to whether or not that is enough i am supporting this rule so that we can move forward to begin to debate this question of the war powers resolution and it is important that the branches of government understand you cannot roll over the constitution the

loopholes for some of the wealthiest corporations on earth cutgo doesnt lay down any rules about tax expenditures we could entirely stop collecting taxes and let the budget and the economy collapse

not fair for these institutions to be faced with up to a half million dollars in penalty fees especially in these tough economic times at the same time many of these institutions continue to struggle

which is a decision that was made based on 2 full years of work and on a 200page synthesis of major scientific assessments including assessments performed by the unitedstates global change research program and the intergovernmental panel on climate changes fourth assessment report in fact the unitedstates court of appeals in washington recently rejected challenges to epas scientific endangerment finding saying that epa used an ocean of evidence to support its decision that it was unambiguously correct in its determination and that epa is not required to reprove the existence of the atom every time it approaches a scientific question republicans decided that peerreviewed science was inconvenient because that analysis was what started the pretend war on coal so we have to vote again and again and again to eliminate all of that science this bill tells epa to ignore the science that air pollution causes lung disease and that mercury damages childrens developing brains in fact it tells epa dont even look at the science look at the costs if controlling air pollution is expensive then we shouldnt do it even if it would save lives it says no matter what epa learns about the sludge that comes out of coalfired power plants no matter how high the concentrations of poisonous arsenic mercury or chromium and that no matter what epa learns about how these materials find their way into our drinking water epa is not allowed to scientifically determine that material to be hazardous this bill turns a blind eye to science the only time republicans value science is when science can be used as a weapon when science can be used to delay regulations when endless analysis can be used to create paralysis the republicans suddenly value science the republican majority doesnt like that every respected scientific entity over the last decade has concluded that greenhouse gases cause climate change their solution repeal the science republicans arent happy that the secretary of health and human services has issued a report that finds that formaldehyde causes cancer sure the world health organization already determined that 17 years ago their solution we should study it again we should allow a national academy of sciences review so that we can prevent the administration from taking any action to protect the public against dangerous formaldehyde in fact there has already been a rider

called the misery index we had unemployment rising we had inflation rates around 20 percent we had by all gauges a difficult time a time that many people looked upon with despair and many suggested that the issues were so large and the problems so great that no president could possibly deal with it no congress and the american people could not it was just prior to that time that i met a gentleman from georgia mr gingrich as we were both freshman members elected and we began talking about the fact that our party had not been in the majority for well over a generation that there seemed to be a lack of a vision for the future and that there was an acceptance of mediocrity and failure and secondclass status for america our belief was at that time that we could come together with a number of other members and try and at least give voice to a new idea a new vision a more positive vision for america we worked together with other members and formed what was called the conservative opportunity society because we thought that that was a positive vision for the future of america consistent with republican principles and more importantly consistent with and expressive of american principles we thought it was an antidote to what we saw leading us at that time as the liberal welfare state i think history has shown that with the election of ronald reagan and the embracing of the conservative opportunity society vision of america that america could turn around we are confronted with what i believe to be a failed presidency at the present time we are confronted with questions and some great despair in families around america for the failure of an opportunity for jobs and i would suggest that at this point in time it is appropriate for those who have visions those who are ready to challenge the conventional wisdom those who believe that americas best days are ahead not behind to come to the fore there are those who look at the faults of newt gingrich id like to suggest that he was the one person that i know that had a vision in this house of how this house could be changed how we working as an institution could work with a president to make changes and ultimately
