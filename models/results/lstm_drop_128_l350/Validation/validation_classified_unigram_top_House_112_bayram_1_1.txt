terrorist attempts to attack new york have been stopped now lets get something straight the presidents homeland security advisor john brennan recently visited with the nypd during that meeting or following that meeting mr brennan president obamas homeland security advisor stated i have full confidence that the nypd is doing things consistent with the law and its something that again has been responsible for keeping this city safe over the past decade mr brennan the presidents homeland security advisor went on to say if we are going to have the ability to identify and stop terrorist operatives and terrorist attacks here on our shores the national government cannot do it alone the nypd is a model of how a community can come together he closed by saying to the nypd you have had a very difficult job i think youve done it very well the success is in the record in terms of keeping your city safe in addition to that fbi director mueller has stood by the nypd said that they are in full compliance with the law cia director petraeus there was an ig inspection done that the nypds relationship with the cia was in full compliance with the law these slanderous attacks by the associated press and the new york times cannot point out one instance of a law being violated or one provision of the constitution being violated we should be here tonight giving the nypd a medal we sit here 1012 years after september 11 and the most effective law enforcement counterterrorism unit in the country is being attacked we are attempting to cite the constitution and provisions of law as

those attacks are being joined here on the floor of the congress of the united states without one fact to back them up there is no spying all this is good police work the reality is were not going to sit back like we did on september 11 and allow the enemy to come if we know that an attack is coming and were told for instance that operatives are coming from a particular country and theres a

solely on the quality of their products and the willingness of the market to purchase those products instead these companies rely on their political connections to subsidize their businesses exim even provided enron with hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance before that companys ignominious collapse do we really want to continue funding the enrons of the world not only is it bad economics to force working americans small businesses and entrepreneurs to subsidize the exports of large corporations it is also immoral redistribution from the poor and middle class to the wealthy is the most indefensible aspect of the welfare state yet it is the most accepted form of welfare at a time when the federal government is running unprecedentedly large budget deficits why are we reauthorizing subsidies for large corporations i hope that my colleagues who criticize welfare for the poor on moral and constitutional grounds will vote against this program that provides welfare for the rich proponents of continued american support for exim claim that the bank creates jobs and promotes economic growth however this claim rests on a version of what the great economist henry hazlitt called the broken window fallacy when a hoodlum throws a rock through a store window it can be said he has contributed to the economy as the store owner will have to spend money having the window fixed the benefits to those who repaired the window are visible for all to see therefore it is easy to see the broken window as economically beneficial however the benefits of the broken window are revealed as an illusion when one takes into account what is not seen the businesses and workers who would have benefited had the store owner not spent money repairing a window but rather been free to spend his money as he chose similarly the beneficiaries of exim are visible to all what is not seen is the products that would have been built the businesses that would have been started and the jobs that would have been created had the funds used for exim been left in the hands of consumers leaving those funds in the private sector ensures that those resources will be put to the use most highly valued by individual consumers in contrast when the government diverts resources into the public sector via programs such as exim their use is determined by bureaucrats and politically powerful special interests resulting in a distorted market and a misallocation of resources by distorting the market and preventing resources from achieving their highest valued use exim actually costs americans jobs and reduces americas standard of living finally i would like to remind my colleagues that there is simply no constitutional justification for the expenditure of funds on programs such as exim in fact the framers of the constitution would be horrified to know that the federal government was taking hardearned money from the american people in order to benefit the politically powerful in conclusion exim distorts the market by allowing government bureaucrats to make economic decisions instead of individual consumers exim also violates basic principles of morality by forcing american taxpayers to subsidize the operations of wealthy companies that could easily afford to engage in international trade without government assistance exim also violates the limitations on congressional power to take the property of individual citizens and use it to benefit powerful special interests it is for these reasons that i strongly urge my colleagues to reject h r 2072"], [0.9808356463909149,

impossible to imagine that in the event that revenues are at a shortfall in the congress of the united states that there will ever be a congress under the threefifths requirement as spoken of in this

such time as i may consume as my distinguished colleague from georgia congressman westmoreland pointed out whom i am very pleased to serve as a cosponsor with on this bill he very aptly described the very dire situation facing our state of georgia as i stand here georgia since the 2008 financial difficulties started in this country 67 banks have failed which makes us the leader in the nation in this area in our state we have some very capable business people in georgia and in atlanta very sterling leaders of the financial services industry worldwide based out of atlanta were grappling with the recovery but there is no more important sector of our economy than our banking system it is indeed the heart of our economic system it pumps out the credit it pumps out the capital that makes our economy go around so it is very important that we really deal with an area and with information and with an effective study so that we can grasp the full meaning of what caused this to happen what were the characteristics in atlanta or in georgia that caused this disproportionate number of bank failures and indeed we could learn so much so that we can prevent this type of a collapse in our bank financial system from happening again and make a very valuable contribution so with that i want to take just a moment to explain what we are doing with this important bill h r 2056 that we feel will make a very valuable contribution to preventing these kinds of collapses from happening again to the detriment of our economic system the purpose of this bill is one to determine the extent to which certain fdic practices precipitated the bank failures we need to find out if theres something that the fdic was doing that regulators were doing that we need to improve upon two we need to determine whether various fdic policies and practices for resolving failed banks are appropriate thats very important to know if what were doing is not appropriate we can fix that and three we need to determine the extent to which the fdic employees themselves in the field the investigators the bank examiners take actions that were consistent with fdic policies and procedures that we developed here in washington in other words we need to take the time to look at this peculiar situation of this rash of bank failures in one basic geographic area of this country to see what really went wrong and if there were some things that we were doing here in washington that we need to correct and finally we need to determine the extent to which the fdic policies and procedures are applied consistently across all banks this information will be very important the bill requires that the fdic inspector general within 1 year of enactment of this bill will conduct a study on the impact of the failure of banks and report the results and any associated recommendations back to congress this study would address one the effect of the fdics use of loss sharing agreements on relevant stakeholders including banks that survive and borrowers of the failed idi two the significance that paper losses including the extent to which they trigger idi receiverships and the impact they have on raising more capital three the success of field examiners in implementing the fdic policies and procedures on commercial real estate workouts one of the things we find in our state of georgia one of the common characteristics that sort of held these banks separate was the overleverage we shall say of the portfolios in real estate and the housing bubble burst on us four the application and impact of consent orders and cease and desist orders including whether such orders are used consistently across all types of banks and also the application and impact of fdic policies particularly as they relate to a banks ability to attract private capital and then the fdics handling of potential investments by private equity companies in banks in h r 2056 as introduced we received great bipartisan support and

of poverty and dealing with the issue of hunger in america and around the world let me say to my colleague from north carolina i will match my antihunger credentials against hers 7 days a week but in this bill that has been brought before us the cuts in wic would end food assistance for 200 000 to 350 000 lowincome women and children that is a conservative estimate she mentioned food for peace how grateful we should be that they are throwing some scraps at the problem of international hunger in this bill there is a 39 percent decrease in food for peace title ii funding and it will put millions of lives at risk and undermine the ability of usaid to prevent famine food aid provided by usaid is a lifesaving measure for millions of vulnerable people overseas according to usaid these brutal cuts will mean up to 16 million people mainly women and children will not receive the lifesaving food aid the gentlelady mentions the mcgoverndole program which is near and dear to my heart the

life and i hope that the gentleman from california actually read the report maybe he did and maybe these pages got stuck together i dont know but if you look at the reporthe said that we dont care about the lands and the designations that we just want to use them up and all that kind of stuff let me read for the record what the report says as mentioned in the introduction of this report the committee lauds the department of the interior for its significant changes in wild lands policy and notes that the bureau of land management has to this date been in compliance with the fiscal year 2011 continuing resolution prohibiting funds for the use of secretarial order 3310 which was to designate and as the gentleman said he couldnt designate wild lands because that policy didnt exist and he cant and hes in compliance with that it continues while the department is now rightly requesting the input of members of congress senators and the public the committee is concerned about the internal direction given by the bureau of land management regarding the inventory of lands managed by the bureau as the department has stated inventories of bureau lands are required under the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma and the committee agrees the committee agrees with this reading of the act the committee points out that inventories should however cover all land uses multiple use not just lands with wilderness character the values to be assessed include wildlife fish habitat nonmotorized and motorized recreation hunting fishing grazing conventional and renewable energy development mining wilderness character forest management and aesthetics all of these values are important and one value does not supersede the other the committee also directs the bureau to use the definition of wilderness as defined in the 1964 wilderness act as directed by section 603 of flpma the committee will continue its oversight of this issue the secretary has done the right thing by withdrawing his policy of wild lands designation a designation that he made up only congress can designate a new land designation thats what congress does the secretary agreed with that withdrew it we have no problem and encourage them to go on with the inventories for all of the characteristics of public lands so the gentlemans comments relative to oh all we care about is mining and flattening the land or whatever he said is just rhetoric i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment the reality is if the secretary carries out what he says hes going to do this amendment probably isnt necessary if they decide to reverse course then it was necessary if they do what they said they are going to do it absolutely wont have any effect as the gentleman from utah said"],

companies and health care providers from any liability or full liability when they cause harm or death the medical malpractice part of this bill is so bad that the california medical association rejects the bill and says to vote no unless they had a decent medical malpractice reform part in it and when the doctors will reject medical malpractice reform issues you know its got to be bad this extreme proposal is really not needed i happen to agree with the part of the bill that repeals ipab we refused to include it in the house version of health reform and congress has always stepped in in its congressional manner to strengthen medicares finances when needed and i see no need for us to relinquish that duty we only have to look at the health reform law it has extended solvency it has slowed spending growth it has lowered beneficiary costs it has improved benefits modernized the delivery system created new fraudfighting tools weve done a good job in fact the cbo projects that ipab wont even be triggered until the next 10 years proving weve already done our job here in congress of strengthening medicares finances todays republican support to repeal ipab isnt a sincere interest in providing medicare for all they still want to give us an unfunded or underfunded voucher slash and burn funding and despite my opposition to ipab its far less dangerous to medicare than the

killed on the battlefield in flanders and other places in belgium and france after the great world war i was over with he came back home to the united states while 114 000 doughboys did not return alive many of them died from flu that they had contracted in france and died in the united states four million served 114 000 died and frank buckles jr got to come home after the war was over with when the great world war ii started he was in the philippines he was captured by the japanese and held as a prisoner of war for 31 2 years and shortly before he was to be executed by the japanese he was rescued as other prisoners of war americans filipinos were rescued he spent the remainder of his years in the united states he drove a tractor in west virginia until he was 107 and then last year at the age of 110 frank buckles died frank buckles had a mission before he died it was to see that all who lived and died and served in the great world war i were remembered by this country you see he was the last doughboy he was the last american who died from the great world war i this second photograph is a more recent photograph taken when frank buckles and i and others were at the d c memorial for world war i veterans frank buckles and others including myself members of the senate and members of this house wanted to see that the d c memorial which was exclusively to remember the veterans from d c great americans who lived fought and died representing our country in the great world war i to see that this d c memorial was expanded to not only honor the d c veterans who served but all americans who served in world war i after all it is on the national mall where we have three other great memorials to the four important wars of the last century you see america built the vietnam memorial then built the korean memorial and then built the world war ii memorial but there is no memorial on the national mall for all americans who served in the great world war i and it is time that we do that that we honor all that served not just the few but all of them so ive introduced legislation along with my friend from missouri emanuel cleaver to have legislation that will do three things first of all it will take this memorial that you see in the back of this photograph the world war i d c memorial at the time this photograph was taken it was in a state of disrepair it has since been repaired by the national park service which oversees the memorial take this memorial honor the d c vets and expand it to include and make it the district of columbia and national world war i memorial maybe even give more recognition to the people of d c who built the memorial the schoolchildren who collected money so it could be built many years ago but make it a memorial for all who served in world war i the second thing it would do is also designate the liberty memorial in kansas city as the world war i museum which would be in kansas city missouri you see it is the museum in the united states that honors and recognizes the history of world war i and the third thing that this bill would do is set up a commission so america can commemorate world war i you see its almost been 100 years since that war started not much is being said about world war i i asked a person not too long ago what he remembers about world war i from history books and he said isnt that the war where snoopy fought the red baron unfortunately too many americans know nothing about our history and its time we do something and so were going to have a commission to honor world war i and all who served this commission is not going to be paid for by the taxpayers theres no taxpayer money involved in any of this but itll be set up to make sure that america remembers the 100th anniversary and that

absolutely nothing to do with this amendment its a whole different issue should the resources committee be looking at the prices charged for cattle grazing or mining other things sure they should be

litigating in federal court that means they have to go through the review process thats been set up administratively before they can go to court recently numerous lawsuits over grazing have been filed in federal courts before the administrative review process had been completed that means they havent gone through to find out whether they would win or lose on the administrative side this ties up the blm field offices because they must respond to both an administrative process on one side and a litigation process on the other side this provision simply requires litigants to first exhaust the

they can still file for temporary restraining orders nothing in this provision prevents that i would hopeand i know the ranking member of the full committee mr dicks because weve talked about this
