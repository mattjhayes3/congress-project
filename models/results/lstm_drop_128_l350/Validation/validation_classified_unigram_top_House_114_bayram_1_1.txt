my time this is a great piece of legislation regardless of which side of the aisle we sit on and regardless of whether we think government is too big or too small i think almost everybody in this chamber should be able to agree that the government needs to do its job well it needs to spend taxpayer money efficiently it needs to get the job done for the american people one of the ways it can do that is by adopting modern technology and taking advantage of the disruption that we have seen in the private sector that has brought us innovations like our phone that now is more powerful than a desktop computer just a few years ago i agree with the gentleman from california it is absolutely imperative that we provide better more efficient service to our veterans but the same should be true in dealing with every area of government you should get as good service from the government as you do in the private sector we can talk all we want about the federal bureaucracy and i am sure i will probably disagree with some of the folks on the other side of the aisle about some of the pros and cons of this but i think what we have seen in california in texas in the carolinas in boston and all over this great nation as we have seen this boom in technology as we have seen the changes that are coming that we are able to do more with less we are able to do things faster we are able to be more efficient and we are able to give people more leisure time this innovation economy this mindset of the entrepreneur is something that this program brings into the federal government many people spend long careers in the federal government where it is often disincentivized to innovate this shortterm program that brings the best of the best into the government for short periods of time to shake things up and to rethink how we do things is one of the ways that we can make it where the federal government actually can compute its way out of a paper bag it is a way we are able to help our veterans it is a way we are able to help all of our citizens by providing the services that we choose to provide as a government in the most efficient manner and it gives us an opportunity for

accountability act of 2015 i want to thank chairman mccaul and ranking member thompson for their leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor h r 719 will save the taxpayers hundreds of thousands dollars annually by requiring the transportation security administration tsa to conform its personnel classification practices to existing federal law and regulations regarding criminal investigator positions according to a report by the homeland security departments inspector general ig about half of the employees in the office of inspection oil are classified as criminal investigators even though their duties do not involve responsibilities that can be characterized as criminal investigation activities instead the responsibilities of these employees primarily consist of administrative duties such as investigating cases of tsa employee misconduct and conducting internal reviews classifying these employees as law enforcement personnel however makes them eligible for premium pay and other significant economic benefits if tsa fails to reclassify criminal investigator positions as noncriminal investigator positions or nonlawenforcement positions this will cost taxpayers as much as 17 000 000 over 5 years this money could be utilized to ensure that law enforcement agencies which identify apprehend and prosecute criminals have the tools resources and training necessary to do their job efficiently effectively and economically i have always strongly supported providing the resources needed by law enforcement and first responders and will continue to do so in future but we have an obligation to the american people to be responsible stewards of the public trust and it is not responsible to provide premium pay and benefits intended for law enforcement personnel to employees who do not perform the dangerous duties of law enforcement officers this bill will obligate the assistant secretary of tsa to reclassify criminal investigator positions in the

of their time performing criminal investigative duties this is an important step to bring transparency to the office of inspector with regards to the work of tsa personnel and law enforcement

adversaries in protecting the health and safety of workers as chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee on the international relations committee he took on the daunting and often thankless task of fighting to promote democracy and defend human rights in central and south american nations he did this not only for the sake of justice in those countries but also to protect the interests of the

commission with little to no consideration of the rules benefits prior to issuing the new rule these regulatory cutgo provisions would apply to every new agency rule no matter how important or pressing for every regulatory agency alarmingly title ii would also require agencies to undertake a notice and comment process for all rules eliminated through cutgo because as i noted earlier agencies are unable to simply rescind the rules thus this bill would substantially delay or even prevent new regulations through this burdensome and timeconsuming requirement as several of my colleagues amendments demonstrate the bills regulatory cutgo procedures are unsafe dangerous and would tie the hands of agencies responding to public health crises requiring timely regulatory responses in fact this bill lacks any mechanism for consideration of public policy and safety which would leave no option for agencies to issue emergency rules to protect the public and environment from imminent harm the bills proponents claim that title i of h r 1155 would allow the commission to consider whether the costs of the bill are not justified by the benefit to society as professor levin testified during the subcommittees consideration of a previous version of this bill the catchall language of subsection h 2 i would allow the commission to recommend the repeal of any rule promulgated by any agency if it deems the rules requirements to be unnecessarily burdensome in short the commission would be completely free to disregard any benefit of the regulation by proceeding under this language or the bills other advisory language furthermore h r 1155 is silent on what methodology the commission must follow requiring only that it must have one which leaves the window wide open for absolutely no consideration of the benefits of regulation while consideration of the cost of regulations is sometimes important there is overwhelming consensus that the benefits of regulation vastly exceed the costs in both the republican and democratic administrations the benefits of our regulatory system of regulatory protections have made our country safer stronger healthier and cleaner the nonpartisan government accountability office has observed that these benefits include among other things ensuring that workplaces air travel foods and drugs are safe that the nations air water and land are not polluted and that the appropriate amount of taxes is collected the gao reported in 2007 that while the costs of these regulations are estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars the benefits estimates are even higher in 2012 the office of management and budget likewise concluded that even by conservative estimates the benefits of major regulations exceeded the costs
