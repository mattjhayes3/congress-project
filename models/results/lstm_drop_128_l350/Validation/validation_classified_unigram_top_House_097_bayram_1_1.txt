debt collection agencies in order to collect delinquent federal debts my colleagues are already aware of the massive debts owed to the federal government and of the enormous amount of this debt that is delinquent mismanagement on the part of bureacrats has permitted these delinquent debts to accumulate the details of the problem are described in the recently issued report of the office of management and budget debt collection project on may 18 1981 the house passed h r 2811 a bill designed to help agencies manage their debts in a more businesslike fashion and to make agency debt collection activities more effective that bill was only one step in the effort to improve debt collection practices and to increase the revenue from delinquent debts because agencies have such a poor track record in managing their debts we must recognize that there may be times when agencies need assistance that is what the bill i have introduced today will do it will authorize and regulate the use of private debt collection agencies by the federal government i hope that use of private debt collectors in appropriate circumstances will increase the repayment of debts owed to the federal government i am convinced that use of these private collectors can be done in a way that is consistent with the right to privacy the rules that govern the contracting out of government functions and the laws that regulate debt collection practices this bill is necessary because it is not clear under present law that agencies have the authority to enter into contracts for debt collection services for many years the general accounting office took the position that federal agencies could not legally delegate the debt collection function to private contractors in order to overcome this restriction congress found it necessary to expressly authorize the use of private debt collectors for a specific category of debts in the education amendments of 1976 public law 94482 i was surprised when the general accounting office and the department of justice reversed this interpretation and amended the regulations for the federal claims collection act the amended regulations require agencies to consider contracting for debt collection services this rule change appeared in the federal register for april 17 1981 no adequate reason for the shift in legal position was cited by the general accounting office and the justice department in the explanation that accompanied the rule change i asked the congressional research service to take a look at the issue of the legality of contracting our for debt collection services crs found no clear legal explanation for the change in the opinion of the general accounting office and the justice department it seems to me that if an activity was once considered to violate federal law then it takes a legislative change in order to make that activity legal neither the comptroller general nor the attorney general has the authority to amend federal statutes because of the tremendous uncertainty engendered by the change to the federal claims collection act regulations we need to clarify the law no agency can responsibly rely on the newly revised rule i am concern ed that any action based on this questionable interpretation will lead to significant disruption of agency debt collection efforts it will raise questions of possible

it seems apparent to me the message they are sending us is not one which seeks to promote the legitimacy of homosexuality individuals may have the right in their own personal lives to do as they see fit this is not to say however that the congress of the united states should venerate that conduct by expending funds to protect those practices it is therefore my proposal that no part of this bill

ing the efficiency and the effective today in terrible danger should war ness in the pentagon bureaucracy that come of a decisive defeat we are seeking in the civilian bureauc how vital is this consideration how racies important is it to us as everyday citiito place this in context i think we zens to worry about a war that probhave to begin with president reagans ably will not come to worry about a commitment under president carter battle that may not happen in constant 1982 dollars we6 had pro let me suggest first of all that the posed to spend 172 9 billion in 1980 in actual processes of defeat is itself inobllgationeil authority that had wartime everything no matter how grown to 186 billion in 1981 and to good your intellectual arguments no 196 billion in 1982 matter how good your bureaucracies under president reagan however no matter how eloquent your statewe dramatically increased from 172 6 ments to armed services committees billion in 1980 to 193 9 billion in 1981 if you cannot win on the battlefield to a proposed 222 2 billion in 1982 to nothing else matters 238 4 1billion in 1983 anid so on it is it was said best by winston churthe largest increase in defense spend chill who warned us in the gather ing in peacetime since the late thirties ing storm quoting from a speech he why did president reaganbelieve had made in 1934 that wars come we need that increase because the quickly that you cannot be certain president and his advisers believe that when they wfi happen that one day the world is dangerous because they suddenly an ambaisador comes he de believe that the soviet military build livers a message and the following day up is a threat your countries are at war the battlefield is more than just this front or that front this division or that division the battlefield is the heart and mind of the nation the strategy the general conditions in which the political leadership makes decisions harry summers in an excellent book on vietnam entitled on strategythe vietnam war in context colonel summers currently an active officer in the army teaching at the carlisle war college begins his book with a quote you know you never defeated us on the battlefield said the american colonel the north vietnamese colonel pondered this remark a moment and said that may be so but it is also irrelevant conversation in hanoi april i1075 the north vietnamese won that war on the battlefield of our minds on the battlefield of our budgets on the battlefield of our foreign policy even if they never won that war on the battlefield around saigon so long as ameri can troops were present currently we face a crisis because we are losing a war on the battlefield of the pentagon just as surely as we are losing a war potentially on the battlefields of europe or the middle east president reagan attempted to shift the quantitative side of defense spending he attempted to increase dramatically our commitment to a sound defense secretary weinberger has done i think an excellent job at the strategic level of forcing the military bureaucracies to think again and again about the mx mobile basing system und ar secretary carlucci has done a superb job of forcing fundamental thinking about procurement policy within the context of the pentagon in some recent votes on authorization bills we have changed some of the laws to allow thepentagon to spend more wisely but on balance the reagan administration has not done the job it needs to and as a consequence we are today at the beginning of our first retreat from what was a brief 6month surge of defense spending 1 there are three reasons we are retreating first the russians have not invaded poland the world seems less dangerous and shooting down twolibyan jets felt good it gave the american people the sense that we showed them second the wave of spending c uts on the civilian side has not been matched by equal toughness in defense spending there is not a sense thatwe are as willing to grill the generalsaswe are to grill the civilian bureaucracies while i praise secretary weinberger and under secretary carlucci for thei r initiatives i have to fault them for their lack of flair their lack of publicity to too great an extent cap the knife is in danger of becoming cap thie advocate and should that happen i fear he will lose his effectiveness in convincing the american people that we will question amilitary bureaucracy as tightly as a civilian bureaucracy the third and deeper reason that the reagan administration is steadily losing ground in the congress and i think ultimately in the news media in the country on the issue of defense spending is because the dry rot of the pentagon bureaucracy remains unchallenged you can take every quote by president reagan about bureaucracy in general every quote about its waste its silliness its lack of direction and you can apply them to the pentagon the reality is that the pentagon is the largest most sophisticated bureaucracy in this city that for last 38 years they have systematically and steadily developed an ability to do less and less while spending more and more with greater and greater complexity here are some recent examples the desert one tragedy in iran led to no firings no resignations no courts of inquiry when the british in the 18th century lost majorca they executed the admiral who failed in this country on all too many occasions in recent years we have promoted the senior of cer who failed on cost overruns to the best of my knowledge there have been no major firings of the military leaders directly involved in spending large chunks of money in effect whatever happens on the battlefield or in the building project the game goes on in many cases the officer who had the overrun ends up working for the company he had the overrun with simply throwing more money at obsolete ideas and absurd structure does not solve anything in the long run it may in fact weaken things both by crippling those of us who favor a strong defense and also by leading some people to believe we are actually beig saved while all we are being is wasteful the challenge i would raise is much deeper than anything we have seen this year if the administration thinks the defense threat the danger of war is important enough to spend this amount of money on then it ought to be willing to fundamentally reform the pentagon bureaucracy we need elihu root not henri maginot as secretary of defense we need a willingness to fundamentally restructure things for those who remain faithful to the vision of military bureaucratic compei tence let me suggest the following facts should at least lead them to question their faith first i have asked this of every officer i have seen recently there is no major war we can win with the soviets period let me repeat that there is no major war we can win against the soviets period second we nowfocus on buying high technology in a narrow formula that prevents us from using the high technology we spend so much money on for example we buy the f15 h 61 19 fighter aircraft a superb aircraft clearly one of the two finest airsuperiority fighters in the world the other being the f14 we buy it with enormously complex and expensive elec tronic gear so it can fight in what is called a forceonforce conflict that is with many aircraft in the air at one time yet in testimony before the senate appropriations committee on the department of defense appropriations for 1981 general russ said about the third level which is force on forcei so i would say that 95 percent of our people are at level 1 maybe 50 are at level 2 and a few are at level 3 what that means is that you are buying extraordinarily expensive aircraft which you are not flying the pilots in long enough to use the aircraft at its current capability so that 50 percent of your pilots are using the plane as though it were a dramatically cheaper oneonone fighter plane another 40 percent or so are using the aircraft as though it is a slightly superior oneontwo or oneonthree airplane and probably 10 percent of your fighter pilots are sufficiently qualified to use the airplane for the purpose you paid for it is like using a cadillac as a dump truck and it is done because the air force is focused on procuring hardware rather than on building a balanced force that has enough money tonfy the airplane to train the pilots to buy the munitions and to maintain the entire system we have to develop a total equation of research and development procurement maintenance training in order to measure full systems against each other third we are buying an allhightechnology force in a way that is historically absurd the reality is that high technology limits size and a 4 lord nelson warne4 us numbers annihilate it is important to remember that when the german army invaded russia in 1941 there were only 24 armored divisions the rest of that army was infantry with horsedrawn logistics the israelis in 1973 were still using world war ii supersherman tanks when necessary we simply cannot buy enough f15s f16s and a10s to equip all of our regular forces and all of our reserves but the professional military bureaucracys answer is to blame the politicians and the people that is candidly a copout wellington had to fight the peninsular war with the army he had not the army he dreamed of midway was won in what walter lord called an incredible victory with the navy available not the navy admiral spruance wanted the current military bureaucracy buys what it wants and shrugs off the gaps in procurement and training as someone elses fault that is simply fundamentally professionally wrong it is like buying a new car and having h 6150 go no money to buy gas to drive it home the syrians in the golan heights in 1973 lost over 100 tanks simply because they ran out of gasoline the japanese suffered extremely high aircraft losses in the mariana turkey shoot of 1944 because they could not train the pilots the first operational jet fighter of germany the me 262 could not achieve its peak effectiveness because of the lack of aviation fuel in germany in 1944 and 1945 the american military bureaucracy is actually planning in the purchasing patterns we see to create the probable fiascos of the future for our own military to spend the money in such a manner that you cannot finish the entire process that fancy weapons systems exist that cannot be used is simply irresponsible example we have a long war structure for the army that is capable not of fighting a short war but fighting

cause and i have deep sympathy for divorced spouses we heard in the hearings we did hold many sad stories and i am a sponsor of the bill that the gentleman from virginia drafted there are a lot of arguments in support for divorced spouses some have been mentioned and some have not they have frequently played a significant role in their husbands careers they have had to endure frequent moves i checked with the military to find out how frequent that was and it is as many as 10 to 12 moves in a 20year career they have had little opportunity to further their education they have little opportunity to hold jobs or to even get good jobs because of the transient nature of their lives then too they have often accepted lowpaying jobs because of that they could not provide continuity in their employment and often suffered poor career advancement for that reason but in addition to the poor work environment they spend many hours of deep concern about the welfare of their husbands especially husbands who are involved in combat they very frequently suffer poorer living conditions than spouses who are not married to military members they have had to pay higher rents they have had forced sales of furniture long periods of family separation and very frequently they have had to act as both parents when their husbands were awayhad to be both father and mother to the children as they were growing up so i conclude that they deserve far better treatment than they have been receiving and i want to certainly help them receive more equitable treatment equity i feel is the theme of this bill but not just equity for divorced spouses even though the scales have been balanced unfairly on one side for many many years i do not feel we should unbalance them on the other side in an attempt to remedy this situation i think we must also provide equity for the members of the service what we want is the best most equitable bill for both parties i agree with the gentleman from

honors court orders prior to the mccarty decision it provides improved health care for spouses and finally it provides commissary and exchange provisions to divorced spouses i think these are good

justly deserve i think the committee should be given an e for effort i think they really are concerned with the problem of retention of senior enlisted personnel but i feel they went overboard in trying to resolve a problem that does not really need the attention they gave it the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee my good friend the gentleman from new york made the quote just a couple of minutes ago that new recruits are earning almost as much as oldtimers that statement is true compared to what the situation was before the allvolunteer force but it is not really true when we compare it with the civilian sector before the allvolunteer force there used to be a huge disparity in pay between the e9 and e1 perhaps as much as 9 to 1 there was a very steep pay grade differential but since the allvolunteer force we have had to offer the e1s more money to come into the service we have had to give them more pay so that we could attract them now the ratio is back to 3 to 1 which is about the way it is in the civilian sector for similar levels of responsibility after 2 years of service then the ratio resumes its rather sharp curve to what it used to be which is what the gentleman was referring to the gentleman also mentions that general meyer supports the senate version it is true that he does but he is almost all alone in his support of it as far as our defense experts are concerned let me read a list of those wvho support the house version the 14 3 percent acrosstheboard increase we have the secretary of defense mr weinberger and i assume the whole administration wve have the secretaries of each of the military services the chief of naval operations admiral hayward the personnel chief of the air force general osway and we have most of the military associations the fleet reserve the national association of uniformed services the air force sergeants the veterans of foreign wars the united states army warrant officers association all of them like the 14 3percent accesstheboard increase even though general meyer likes the senate version the trouble with the appropriations committee bill or the senate version is that there is a targeting provision and this is the keystone of their program this is the thrust of their bill but it tends to create chaos and confusion and inequities the sad part of it is that it is not even needed to address the problem of retention they are solving a problem thiat does not exist because our bill solves this problem but in spending so much money and targeting so much to solve the retention problem they create a very serious problem with recruitment that is the other side of the scales retention is on one side recruitment is on the other we do not need any additional targeting under the house bill we permit up to 25 percent of the 14 3percent acrosstheboard pay raise to be targeted if it is needed i seriously hope that the administration does not target 1 of it because it is not necessary but the flexibility is there in the event we do wani to do that then too we already target about 2 billion almost as much as this whole bill represents for many different areas of shortages we target for sub pay we target for sea pay and we target for flight pay hazardous duty pay and proficiency pay we pay extra money for health professionals nuclear qualified officers and enlisted men and we also pay enlistment and reenlistment bonuses we can expand this procedure if necessary if we have shortages in certain areas we can target further this is the preferred method to target to skills not target to grades as the senate version does let us take a look at retention both bills solve the retention easily with 50 000 or 80 000 people left over in a very short period of time it is true that the senate version does it a little faster maybe by 3 months 4 months or 5 months as one speaker suggested he was going to support the senate bill because it would provide us with 4 000 more senior enlisteds the first year that is true it does provide 4 000 more but it is 4 000 out of 790 000 it is less than 1 percent it is sixtenths of 1 percent to get a mere 4 000 additional out of almost 800 000 they would seriously hurt the recruitment effort when they allocate huge sums to the senior enlisted portion of the bill they have to take it from some place they have to rob

assistance program that assists their needy population and has sufficlent protections to insure that the 825 million authorized will be spent in an efficient and effective manner let us keep the food

my district for about the past 8 months this was a conference to bring together community and county leaders local government and business people to discuss economic development the purpose was somewhat in jeopardy in view of the fact that so many of the programs are being cut back for this purpose i frankly went to the conference fearful that there would be great wailing and gnashing of teeth and lamentation because of the fact that we were losing so many federal dollars to help in these efforts to my great surprise and great delight that was not the case the 2day conference actually found people saying we are challenged now maybe we can spend more time working on our own programs and less time filling out federal forms to get on the federal dole perhaps we have underestimated the spirit of our people to roll up their sleeves and solve their own problems perhaps we have overestimated our peoples dependence on the federal dole i came away from the conference with great hope for our future"], [0.006280809640884399, 0.4937191903591156, 0, "the gentleman again clouds the issue by not recognizing the fact that the control of the committees is a tremendous power in this house once you attract representatives in this congress who happen to have certain interests in their own districtsthere is nothing wrong with that since such interests give employment in certain districtsbut which interests in a nationwide analysis may not be best for a total economic plan and they commit themselves to a bill as it comes through the president if he were going to have any hope whatsoever of having the essentials of his program passed through had to deal with that reality the president is a practical man the president is someone who learned while he was governor of the state of california that you have to do the legislative dance if the tune is played by the other side you do not have control of the dance and the tune is played by the other side in this house it has been played by the other side in this house for 25 years if the gentleman suggests that somehow the president should have given up on his vision to cut taxes across the board for individual citizens because this house is controlled by the other party then that is only the gentlemans opinion the president made a different decision he thought we would get the essentials of his progrank through but if the only way to get through the legislative process here was to get involved in the auction block one had to be involved in the auction block we know who the chief auctioneer was let me remind you that he was not of my party if some excesses resulted let us go back and deal with those things let us not attack the third year of the individual tax cut let us not attack indexing let us not come here and suggest that we made a major mistake in terms of our supply side analysis when in fact we had to postpone the application of the program and when in fact there were some distortions in the overall program as it was finally passed out more importantly we should admit that many of us even those of us who are confirmed supply siders probably did not fully appreciate the total cynicism of the american public with respect to the actions of previous congresses and the executives let me point out what i am trying to say the average americans have been told time and again by congress that they will get a tax cut in a particular year yet they look at their paychecks and actually see that they are getting a tax hike they have been told time and again by congress and previous administrations that spending is to be cut and lo and behold spending is increased year after year now we have a president who comes in and did what no one said could be done he started to slow down the growth of spending he started to bring down tax rates to reasonable levels the american people want to know whether we in fact are going to do that or whether we are going to step back when we pass a program in september late august or early september the first part of which only goes into effect in october and some members are already talking in december and january of getting rid of the second and third year of the tax cut why are we surprised that people are skeptical my first theorem of politics is that people are not stupid they have been fooled enough by the judgments of the congress as a whole and by the white house in terms of economic policy in the past we have got to convince them that we meant what we said that was one of the key points in the 3year program you establish a 3year program so people can have some security in knowing that is the way things are going to be for 3 years well if you just passed the program and before it even gets into complete effect you have people saying let us get rid of the second or third year let us get rid of the indexing how do you expect our constituents to respond they respond with some skepticism i would suggest to the gentleman that that skepticism is something that we did not fully appreciate we have got to get beyond that skepticism by showing the american people that we meant what we said when we talked about a 3year tax cut we meant what we said when we talked about indexing once they believe that once they are convinced that that will be done in"], [0.006402492523193359, 0.5064024925231934, 0, "i rise in support of senate joint resolution 61 designating april 9 1981 as african refugee relief day nearly 1 million africans are now located in 32 refugee camps with an additional 3 million in 27 locations on the continent of africa they are suffering from the lack of food shelter and the necessary resources to sustain themselves these refugees are totally dependent on international relief effort if they are to survive as the organization for african unity and the united nations high commissioner for refugees convene in opneva on april 9 and 10 to develop a plan of action i feel it is most fitting that we designate april 9 1981 as african refugee relief day through massive public awareness programs we can make the difference between life and death for the millions of refugees now suffering in africa i feel that once the american people are informed of the conditions now existing in africa made aware of the facts and become knowledgeable as to what success could be achieved in overcoming this situation with their assistance they will respond to the needs of the africanrefugees as they did with cambodian relief"]]}
