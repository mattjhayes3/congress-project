to work on this budget it gave everybody a feeling that they were involved in this process and i know the freshmen that were there were pleased that they were included and can be involved in what was going on and learning about their specific area i know i enjoyed working with the gentleman from north carolina on health care it was inspiring to do this because we had a number of different viewpoints that we came from but we came together and said ok this is how were going to do this were going to make some real reform in here were going to do some new things and were going to have just a real solution and not just put something out for people to look at and then throw away i think the republican plan really offers us a clear choice it has no new taxes less government more jobs more takehome pay deficits are reduced by controlling spending not by increasing taxes and domestic spending our belief from our budget committee is that higher taxes now will stifle the economic recovery and actually increase the deficit not lower it and we looked around we asked is there any credibility to this what are people around the country saying to us what are the editorial writers saying are we credible in this and when we started out one of the things we all talked about and john and i talked about was that we had to be intellectually credible in what we put out and it had to be the truth it had to be tough and it had to be bold and i think we have done that and i think we won over some people who were probably our worst critics in times past john and that for example the new york times on march 11 says the budget committee republicans plan isnt flawless but it calls mr clintons bluff and deserves a serious airing remember this is the new york times speaking it involves no tax increases and of course deeper spending cuts than the democrats propose and what do they say at the end but in their rush to act the democrats should not use the sheer force of their majority to mow down any dissenters the republicans have made a goodfaith effort to enter the budget process this year their proposals deserve goodfaith debate i say to the gentleman from ohio im not sure we got all that john but im hoping here tomorrow that were going to be able to get that goodfaith debate because we have some good proposals that should be and even the new york times on march 11 1993 agrees with us on that and then if my colleagues will look at the washington post on march 14 again it is not a group that one would normally say are going to be rubber stamping anything that we put out and again their headline reads the republicans find a budget the committee republicans under the leadership of john kasich likewise distinguished themselves for years republicans have fled the field at budget time their goal has been td leave the names on no budget this year republican leaders have gone differently and put forward a plan to reduce the deficit as much as the democrats would do but without tax increases so we are finding allies in places that we did not think we would find even the washington post is saying hey this deserves a look it is not perfect we know it is not perfect but we are trying we have given a better alternative here is another one david broder says again from the washington post on march 14 says speaking of the budget the new ranking minority member of the house budget committee john kasich and his gop colleagues that is us guys deserve credit for assembling with no great staff resources an alternate budget that meets the test of being serious and substantive the achievement is greater than its prospects for success that is why we are out here now we want people to look at this and improve our success the article goes on to say kasich and his allies said that if republicans are to make an effective case for being returned to power they have to demonstrate their seriousness about such large public policy problems as the budget deficit they did that and down the road one hopes there will be a reward for meeting this obligation we think our reward is in making this country better we think our reward is in getting our policies adopted and we have already found out that the other side has figured out some of these things are pretty good so what are they doing why they are starting to look at some of these and adopt them as if they are their own the part that we put in and the gentleman from ohio may want to talk about them i want to comment from one other article from the austin americanstatesman i happen to know the publisher of this paper because he used to live in my hometown and he worked for the coxes and this is obviously a cox paper also roger klnczel their editorial says gop plan on spending cuts deserves a look the house republican members of the budget committee have a proposal that would cut the deficit by 429 billion over five years but would not have any tax increases whether the latter is possible or wise is problematic but some of the specific cuts in the gop plan are well worth looking into although the house leadership says it will accept only complete floor substitutes for the budget committees democraticdominated plan there is a possibility that some amendments could be offered and accepted or added in the conference committee process i guess what i am saying is that there is an outcrying within the media here and certainly in our constituents our constituents are writing us saying cut this spending no new taxes give us some relief from this what the media seem to be saying here is hey other side hey majority you cant have it all look at here there are some good ideas here why not take some of these ideas if you cant take it all adopt some of them these are worth looking at this is real i think this is worth looking at and i think these editorial writers who obviously do not work for us they are obviously people of good will who said now is the time to make some real positive changes in this country if we really want change you have got an opportunity starting with this budget process to make change let us not just do things in the way of one sidedness where things are

from west virginia does have one salutary effect in the discussion of this amendment and that is the idea of raising the concept of a capital budget as he has pointed out many of our states do have capital budgets all corporations use capital budgets most communities use capital budgets most other governmental bodies use capital budgets but what is the problem with it why should the federal government not use a capital budget the difference is one very fundamental reason and that is as it relates to all other governmental bodies we do not have a limitation that almost every other governmental body does have of keeping everything within an overall budget cap that is most states operate under a balanced budget requirement of their state let me explain why i think that is important since states do have a balanced budget amendment they cannot exceed the total spending by taking two items here social security and capital and placing them off budget under the federal budgets and making everything else subject to a budget cap what we essentially do is encourage the federal government that is encourage congress to play games with the definitions we use for what is and what is not capital let me give just one example which would come along very soon when we find ourselves very tight against the budget limit human capital human capital is capital education could be considered a part of human capital and we could very quickly put all of that off budget as being a nonbudget item the second issue i want to mention very briefly is the issue of social security the gentlemen who take that and put it off budget and many of us have argued we ought not to include that for years as a part of the total federal budget that we ought to protect it but to paraphrase what gertrude stein once said a rose is a rose is a rose a deficit is a deficit is a deficit if the federal government goes bankrupt the whole social security system is going to go bankrupt so let us not

was just made was that president clinton has proposed what is called an economic stimulus package that is costing 16 5 billion and it is not even included in the budget that they are talking about all the deficit spending that is in that budget which is into the billions and billions and billions of dollars even though there is a 400 billionplus tax increase in there does not include this 16 billion socalled economic stimulus package that is filled with pork g it has got swimming pools in there for various communities around the country it has got gymnasiums in there for various communities around the country it has got parking garages in there it has got libraries in there these are things that local communities ought to pay for but taxpayers from around the country are taking care of their friends in alabama and their friends in florida and their friends in california with these porkbarrel projects and the thing that is most irksomeabout this if there is such a work is that the president has not even put it in this budget it is 16 billion more that is going to be added to the debt in addition to what this does i just heard from my colleagues this is going to increase the national debt by 586 billion over the next year i wonder how many other things we are going to have added to this debt over the next year certainly this 16 5 billion socalled economic stimulus package which i call pork package is going to be added in addition to it we have to start coining new words new definitions around here today i started one clintonomics remember reaganomics everybody criticized remember clintonomics because it is going to cost 1 4 million jobs in the next 4 to 5 years that is how many jobs we aregoing to lose at least according to most economists clintonomics and it is going to lead to a clintastrophy an economic clintastrophy find that in your lexicon if it is not there now it should be the first thing we ought to do is start addressing the problem of government spending just 10 years ago we had our first 1 trillion national debt now we are almost to 4 5 trillion in debt it took us 200 years to get to 1 trillion and less than 10 years to more than quadruple it and what are we doing instead of cutting spending we are raising your taxes more than double the largest tax increase in unitedstates history and that is supposed to solve our problems remember that when you get your paycheck next year remember that when you pay your utility bill and you are paying 400 500 more for gas or electricity inyour home next year because that btu tax the bigtime unemployment tax we call it is going to be hitting each and every one of you the problem is this really concerns me is that the media has not really gone into the program and explained it to the american people it is no wonder to me that the people of this country want president clinton to succeed i want him to succeed but at the same time while he is succeeding i do not want to see him take the economy right down the tubes to a degree that is worse than what we have seen over the last 3 to 4 years we raised taxes in 1990 to the tune of 184 billion and what did it cost it cost us jobs and it cost us an economic recession now they are raising taxes more than double that sure we want president clinton to succeed but we want the economy to succeed even more and the way to make sure the economy succeeds and grows so that we create more jobs and do not lose them overseas is to cut government spending first that is the key government spending is out of control we brought in 500 billion in tax revenues 10 years ago now it is 1 2 trillion almost triplewhat we brought in 10 years ago yet we are still running 300 to 400 billion in red each year so raising taxes is not the answer since we raised taxes 184 billion in 1990 for every 1 in new taxes we have spent 2 70 so the problem is not that we are not getting enough revenue the problem is spending is out of control and they will not make the hard declslotis on cutting spending we had a proposal called the 2percent solution that would freeze all government spending and no more than a growth rate of 2percent per year over the previous year they would not let us even bring it out of the committee on rules to the floor that would have balanced the budget in 6 years without a tax increase that is the problem they want to raise taxes and they want to spend us into oblivion and they are going to do it unless america rises up and says no more no more the problem is they face a dilemma that benjamin franklin said the second continental congress faced and that is they have to either hang together or hang separately and they are swallowing very hard this huge tax increase of president clinton"],

critics who pan the clinton administration deficit reduction plan as having done too much or not enough in comparison to what i had a front row seat for a decade of the reaganbush years and their initiatives hardly resulted in greater investment or smaller deficits when ronald reagan moved into the white house the deficit was just over 74 billion and the national debt and just under 1 billion when george bush moved out of the white house the deficit was racing paid 300 billion and the national debt stood at just over 4 trillion the test of the clinton deficit plan should not be perfection rather is should be does this plan offer a change of direction from failed trickledown economics that brought us shrinking incomes record unemployment soaring debt and more families living in poverty than in the last 40 years the clinton plan delivers that change of direction surely even given its worst assessment the clinton plan could come nowhere close to the recldess results of the past two republican administrations and what do my republican colleagues choose to do to set this situation right nothing not a single member of the party which brought us this debt was willing to begin to reverse the spend now pay later policies which this party wrought more than 40 republican members voted no on every plan even their own partys instead the republican party embarked on an unprecedented

under 180 000 a year will pay a penny more in income taxes need i respect that families with higher incomes will pay higher taxes as they should during the last decade the wealthy saw their incomes increase at a rate of about 136 percent as a result of trickle down economics during this same period working class families incomes fell the clinton plan restores progressivity and tax fairness and asks that the wealthiest do the most to help reduce the deficit middle class families are asked to pay only about 1 a week in the form of the gas tax and every penny of that weekly dollar will go directly to reducing the deficit but the clinton plan does more than just reduce the projected deficit by about 500 billion it also invests in families and in small business el paso alone living in

of which have already been debated at great length on this floor in the weeks and months ahead there will be more such debates i believe with the help and support of this congress president clinton will succeed in changing this nation for the better the legislation before us today is a key aspect of the presidents program a modified lineitem veto as did his predecessors this president has emphasized time and time again that he needs such a power i believe the time is long overdue to give it to him the legislation before the house is actually very simple after the president signs an appropriations act he may within 3 days send the house a special message proposing to rescind or cancel any lineitems in the bill which he might oppose within 2 days of receipt of the presidents message either the majority or minority leader would introduce the presidents bill if neither leader introduced it then on the third day any member could do so the bill would be referred to the committee on appropriations which would have 7 legislative days to report it out the committee could not propose changes to the presidents bill but it could report an alternative bill if it chose an alternative bill would have to rescind at least as much as the presidents bill and draw its rescissions from the same appropriations act as the president the presidents package would have come to a vote in the house within 10 days of when it was introduced the bill would not be subject to amendment or to a demand for a division of the question in other words the house would have to vote up or down on the presidents package as he submitted it if approved by a majority the bill would go to the senate which would consider it under similar expedited procedures and constraints if the legislation passed the senate by majority vote it would go to the president presumably the president would sign it into law since it would be his proposal appropriations would be canceled spending would be cut and the deficit would be reduced if the house rejected the presidents bill and instead passed the alternative bill that bill would go to the senate the senate appropriations committee could report out the alternative bill with or without change but for any alternative to be in order in the senate the senate would first have to vote on and reject the presidents bill if both houses ultimately passed an alternative to the president then that bill would go to the president if he signed it those appropriations would be canceled spending would be cut and the deficit reduced either way the american taxpayer would be the big winner the bill is a temporary 2year experiment after the 2year test the congress can review the process and decide whether to extend it with or without change one of the concerns many members have about a true lineitem veto which would require a constitutional amendment involves the dramatic shift of power it would make from the congress to the executive branch the framers of the constitution could have given the president an item veto they certainly knew how to do it but they declined to do so in fact the presidents current qualified veto was itself a compromise some of founding fathers wanted to give the president no veto at all the constitution is a beautiful document and i have never felt we should lightly tamper with it besides amending the constitution requires a twothirds vote in each house of congress and ratification by threequarters of the state legislatures that process could take years i dont believe we can afford to wait years for this reform moreover last fall i held extensive hearings in the rules subcommittee on the legislative process on the forerunner of the legislation before us today we heard compelling testimony from several witnesses including a distinguished state legislator from wisconsin who warned us it is possible for a chief executive to use a lineitem veto not only to reduce spending but also as a weapon to increase spending on his own pet programs the option for a congressional alternative to the presidents bill will mitigate this possibility h r 1578 will take congress through two full appropriations cycles two full cycles will give us ample evidence to weigh in determining whether the modified lineitem veto actually serves the peoples interests and reduces spending or not if it works and i believe it will then we can extend it or make it permanent at that time i strongly believe the bill is constitutional the american law division of the library of congress has rendered an opinion to the effect that it is constitutional but some have raised questions and as a precaution the bill includes provisions for expedited review in the courts i have supported the legislative lineitem veto for many years in an attempt to enhance accountability on both ends of pennsylvania avenue for our countrys fiscal decisions i am sure no member considers the lineitem veto a cureall for our nations deficit problems but i believe h r 1578 is a good bill and every member ought to support it the clinton administration which participated actively in the process which brought us to the floor today believes it is a good bill later the gentleman from delaware and the gentleman from new york may offer a substitute amendment to change the bill from one requiring the congress to approve the presidents rescission bill to one requiring the congress to disapprove the presidents rescissions the castlesolomon amendment would convert the presidents rescissions from mere proposals to reality under their approach the presidents proposal would take effect permanently and appropriations would be canceled unless congress reenacted them within a specified time since the president would probably veto any bill to disapprove his rescissions the castlesolomon amendment would in effect require congress to muster a twothirds majority in both houses to prevail i hope the members will reject this unwise amendment it would mark a tremendous shift of power from congress to the presidency the amendment is based on the notion that presidents institutionally want to spend less than congresses do i have no reason to draw such a conclusion i know presidents often want to spend money on different things than congresses do but not necessarily less the president has said if we do not change we will not recognize this country in 10 years he has asked virtually every sector of our society to join him in making sacrifices cutting unnecessary spending reducing the deficit and changing from business as usual this congress has already responded to the presidents clarion call for change by passing his budget the lineitem veto is a key part of the presidents legislative program the president believes we must use every weapon at our disposal to win the battle against the federal budget deficit the special interest and to defeat those who would resist change and preserve the status quo the legislative lineitem veto is just such a weapon it will not cure our deficit problem but it will help by enhancing accountability for spending decisions no longer would a president be able to sign an appropriations act including wasteful lineitems and claim he was powerless to block them no longer could congress force upon the president the dilemma of vetoing an entire appropriations act and shutting down the government or signing the whole thing pork and all accountability is what we need and accountability is what this bill will provide i urge all members to

are infinitely harder to track they are much harder to correlate it is much harder to determine with specificity what special interest they may represent they are much harder for the media or for an opponent or the people to know about it is much harder to know with a private large individual contribution who gave how much money to whom and what interest do they represent if we cannot drive

discussion and debate as of october 1 1994 the presidio by law was transferred from the unitedstates army to the national park service to be administered as part of the golden gate national recreation

of credit for his efforts i ask my colleagues to support this bill and support small business i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana"], [0.03638768196105957, 0.5363876819610596, 0, "although we are still an infant among most nations of the world america has developed over the past two centuries a culture as interesting and unique as any in history american art music theater and film has made this country one of the most advanced and artistic cultures in the world i can think of few ways to better teach the next generation of americans about their history than to let them hear the music read the literature and see the films of the twenties forties sixties et cetera art not only serves as a form of entertainment it tells the american story we are all quite aware of the fiscal problems that continue to plague our economy unfortunately the arts like all segments of our society must share in americas fiscal sacrifice like many of my colleagues i do not support the nea authorization bill before us it simply does not cut enough at a time when we cannot find the means to properly care for the elderly and provide homes for the homeless while still attempting to eliminate our huge budget deficit i cannot support the funding levels in this bill we must prioritize spending and make difficult choices we just cannot afford this level of nea spending i oppose the crane amendment abolishing the nea totally i fear that if we eliminate funding for the nea this year we will never be able to resurrect it this would be an injustice not only to todays americans but to the next generation of young americans who will not experience the many works of art we now enjoy local symphonies and plays are some examples of the art the nea provides i encourage presentations of beethoven bach and other contemporaries like gershwin our children could be deprived of the full value of these works if we eliminate funding for the nea that is why i oppose the bill as it stands before us so that we may bring it back to the floor in a form that will permit the funding of morally responsible worthwhile and entertaining works of art while still maintaining the sense of fiscal responsibility the economic climate demands"], [0.04252195358276367, 0.45747804641723633, 0, "mr speaker 1 thank the gentleman for yielding me this time i do rise to speak in favor of the resolution i am relieved and grateful that american troops have not entered haiti in the midst of hostilities and i join with people throughout america in praying for the safety of our troops as they occupy haiti president carter general powell and senator nunn deserve a great deal of credit for helping to forestall the clinton administrations planned invaston of haiti and the loss of american life that would have most likely resuited however i remain very concerned about the future role of american troops in haiti it is essential that we not allow our involvement in haiti to turn into a quagmire our troops should be brought home expeditiously and the purse of the american taxpayer should not remain open indefinitely i am also concerned about the precedent set by this expedition we must remember that we cannot be the worlds policeman we cannot solve all the worlds problems and we cannot establish democracy in any land if the underlying conditions for democratic institutions are not present there moreover congress must act to ensure that in the future undertakings such as this do not occur without the direct involvement of the representatives of the american people in the congress"]]}
