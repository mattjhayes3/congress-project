drug trade my first amendment which is designated sec 14 of h r 2829 provided for demonstration programs by local partnerships to shut down illicit drug market hotspots by deterring drug dealers or altering the dynamic of drug sales this provision authorizes funding for demonstration programs that seek to coordinate an effective intervention using a credible deterrent message this would encourage criminal justice agencies to collaborate with researchers and social welfare agencies to analyze local conditions and develop strategic problemsolving interventions such an approach was proven successful in high point nc upon identifying the drug market and its small group of active dealers law enforcement carefully monitored and documented drug activity and probation parole violations through surveillance and drug buys offenders with any violent criminal history were immediately arrested nonviolent offenders on the other hand were confronted by law enforcement city officials service organizations and their families with a strong deterrent message they were given a choice between facing immediate legal action or ceasing dealing and receiving rehabilitative services consequently the drug market promptly collapsed with minimal police intervention or crime displacement within one year of implementation the drug crime rate of high point fell by 34 and the violent crime rate was cut in half sec 14 of this bill authorizes 10 million for the next three years to fund demonstration programs supporting these interagency collaborations the agencies would be responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the strategic intervention and the director would be responsible for submitting to congress a report identifying the best practices in drug market eradication my second amendment which is designated sec 15 of h r 2829 provided for demonstration programs by local partnerships to coerce abstinence in chronic harddrug users under community supervision through the use of drug testing and sanctions this provision authorizes funding for demonstration programs that seek to reduce the use of illicit drugs by chronic harddrug users living in the community while under the supervision of the criminal justice system approximately 80 percent of the nations cocaine is consumed by a relatively small group of chronic users approximately 4 million threequarters of these users are under the supervision of the criminal justice system by deterring these users we would be able to reduce the nations cocaine consumption by 60 percentand these numbers are similar for other hard drugs such as heroin and meth coerced abstinence is a highly effective means for targeting these users this model is based on predictable frequent drug testing and known nonnegotiable immediate graduated sanctions for example a system where a participant is tested every 72 hours and a dirty test led to an immediate unpleasant sanctionfor example 8 hours in a jury box or 24 hours in jail participants are simultaneously offered incentives such as drug treatment or other rehabilitative services an ongoing example of this model is being used in hawaii where substance abuse violations are common with meth being the drug of choice in october 2005 one year after the program began program participants had an 83 percent reduction in positive test results from 21 9 for control group to 3 8 for program participants and an 87 percent reduction in missed appointments for testing from 10 for control group to 1 3 for program participants this level of effectiveness we cannot ignore for this reason sec 15 of h r 2829 authorizes 10 million for the next 3 years for demonstration programs that administer drug tests to individuals at least twice a week

average cost four years ago which was between 30 and 32 or 1011 percent this legislation will expand the range and number of people eligible for the use of irnet and thereby lower the costs paid by

barriers i support permanent normal trade relations for vietnam and many other provisions in this package however i have a duty to speak out against this bill because it proposes to continue unfair trade concessions to select andean nations in exchange for absolutely nothing i am speaking of the extension of the andean trade preferences act which has been rolled into this package atpa is not a

if they simply had the opportunity to export legitimate products duty free into the united states it is fundamentally unfair for american farmers and has had dramatic repercussions in my district in central washington state one of the peruvian products that have benefited most from the atpa windfall is asparagus which grows in the sandy coastal areas of perunot the mountain highlands where coca is produced since the implementation of the andean trade preferences act in 1991 imports of fresh peruvian asparagus have soared from 2 800 metric tons to well over 55 631 metric tons similarly imports of frozen asparagus from peru have increased more than twenty times this flood of dutyfree imports has been devastating for american asparagus growers in the major production areas of washington michigan and california it has also decimated much of the domestic asparagus processing capacity in fact facing a flood of inexpensive peruvian imports many asparagus processors simply closed their unitedstates operations and reopened down in peru perhaps if you are not from an asparagus production area in this country you may think this tradeoff is worth it if it results in less narcotics production the unfortunate reality is that this policy has failed according to the white house office of national drug policy coca cultivation in peru has increased to 94 000 acresthe highest level in eight years the international trade commission noted that any impact to narcotics trade from atpa is small and indirect yet the impact to the american asparagus producer is the exact opposite nevertheless here we are asking american farmers to sacrifice their livelihoods for another six to twelve months under this bill to pursue a wholly unrelated antinarcotics strategy i regret that we are once again putting the interests of a handful of large industrial asparagus exporters in peruahead of our own fanners in washington michigan and california it is an unfair policy that

many women across the country battling gynecological cancer and their determination to help other women be treated sooner like so many women johanna had experienced symptoms which were not identified initially by the time she was properlydiagnosed her cancer had advanced significantly to a point where treatment is considerably more complicated because gynecological cancers are highly treatable at early stages public education for women and their primary care physicians is all the more important johannas law does just this creating a national public information campaign to educate women and health care providers about the risk factors and early warning signs of gynecologic cancers but goes a step further requiring hhs to quickly develop a national strategy to get this information to

its families its workers and its most vulnerable citizens the laborhhseducation bill embodies our priorities and values as americans in it congress provides the yearly resources needed to keep our families healthy our children educated our workers employed and our most vulnerable citizens a productive part of our society this bill is arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation congress addresses each year chairman regula understands this responsibility he understands that this is the peoples bill and he has worked hard to distribute the limited resources he was given in a fair and conscientious way so my no vote today should in no way be seen as a lack of respect or appreciation for the efforts of ralph regula the chairman of the labor hhs appropriations subcommittee chairman regula and the staff of the subcommittee have worked within this tight budget allocation to address the needs and priorities of our states and communities as best they could under the circumstances for example the conference report includes increases in two critical areas to help infants and their families the first is the centers for disease control and preventions folic acid national education program this program has been instrumental in the prevention of birth defects by encouraging women of childbearing age to take the recommended amount of folic acid daily thereby decreasing the rate of neural tube defects the second increase is for the health resources and services administrations newborn screening program for early identification of infants affected by certain genetic metabolic hormonal and or functional conditions for which there are effective treatment or intervention in addition for the first time this bill also includes programmatic funding for the national media campaign to fight underage drinking which is being conducted by the ad council i thank the committee for helping our country make progress in these critical public health areas the presence of these and a small number of other positive programmatic funding levels however is simply not enough to warrant approving this conference report the constraints placed on this bill by the budget priorities and decisions of the republican leadership are not worthy of this house and the values of the american people i voted against the house bill when it came to the floor in june precisely because it fell soshort of meeting the needs of americas children families and the most vulnerable among us i had hoped that the bill would be improved in the conference it is unfortunate however that in this conference agreement the way they chose to improve overall programmatic funding from the original house bill levels was to take resources away from other priorities and community needs this report and its funding decisions do not stand in isolation they reflect the misguided priorities of a republican leadership that has continually put the interests of the wealthy and the privileged before the needs and priorities of working and middleclass americans this laborhhseducation conference report is a direct result of an economic agenda of tax cuts for the wealthiest americans and it weakens americas future by underfunding key education health and human services programs if approved this bill will impose cuts to essential programs important to americans in at least three major areas first this conference agreement significantly shortchanges our nations workers the bill cuts labor programs 430 million below the fy 2005 levels training and employment services for the 7 4 million americans who are unemployed are funded well below the fy05 levels this includes a 31 million cut to adult training grants a 36 million cut to youth training grants and a 141 million cut to unemployment insurance offices the unitedstates employment service office which matches job seekers with job openings is slashed by 10 5 percent and the report freezes funding for dislocated and older workers in addition the bill slices international labor affairs the program that helps eradicate abusive child labor practices and protect worker rights by 21 percent secondly this report is simply a reaffirmation of the administrations hollow commitment to education slashing the no child left behind funds by 784 million below the fy 2005 level it cuts the education technology block grant program that provides access to technology in schools by a shocking 45 percent from last years level it reduces the even start program supporting services for low literate and lowincome families by 56 percent and as a final point it shortchanges our children with disabilities by funding idea at 4 billion below the republican promise to put special education on a fast track to full funding finally the report is particularly devastating to the health of americans some of its most significant cuts are directed towards the critical programs that provide a health care safety net for the uninsured the conference agreement provides 34 million less than the house passed bill and 89 million less than the senate bill for grants to health centers for services to the uninsured the maternal and child health block grant is cut by 3 percent reducing its true per capita purchasing power by almost 20 percent below the fy 002 level the conference agreement terminates the healthy communities access program that makes grants to local hospitals health centers and providers so that they can provide better integrated systems of care for the underinsured and uninsured lastly as if cutting services wasnt enough the conference agreement virtually decimates the title vii health professions training programs cutting overall funding from 300 million in fy 2005 to 94 million in fy 2006 these drastic reductions to critical programs are not necessary ranking member david obey has consistently laid out a commonsense approach to this problem by simply reducing the tax break for those with incomes greater than 1 million we could add funding for no child left behind programs maintain college affordability by increasing the money for pell grants shore up our health safety net programs and rebuild our public health system to respond to pandemics and possible terrorist attacks but these fiscally responsible efforts by mr obey and the democrats have been defeated by the republican majority at every tum the result is this grossly underfunded bill which we are considering today in the end this congress will be judged by how well we have served the needs of all our

power mother nature has after observing the aftermath of andrew and hurricane katrina on tv i can tell you being hit by an category 3 storm is awe inspiring when you are cowering with your kids and husband and your family in your home and you are boarded up in your house it feels like god is literally throwing bowling balls on the roof it is an emotional stressful situation for those of us who live in structures that have been built under the south florida building code since hurricane andrew and have a sturdy structure in which to live where we were not worried about our homes caving in around us and then yesterday when i had an opportunity to ride with fema on their preliminary damage assessment review and saw the mobile home parks in my district and across south florida spanning the gentlemans district and literally see that the ivalls caved in around the foundations of these homes and just furniture was left massive trees fell falling completely over or snap ing in half and falling on peoples houses we can urge people to leave their homes as much as possible but human nature often motivates people to stay with their belongings and protect their home base i just could not believe what might have happened the fact that we avoided a huge loss of life is just a miracle it really is i have to say the insensitivity on the part of the governor as well as the president both

yesterday that we did not like to see that is why we tell people to have 72 hours of food and water so you do not have to stand in line that was secretary paulison then the governor said he did not understand why people did not heed the warning and get 72 hours worth of food and water in advance of the storm that is an easy thing to do well i do not think governor bush was in south florida for the several days 6 or 7 days progress that wilma made across the continent and saw the lines in advance of the storm and you know what if you do not have money if you cannot buy gas for your car or get to a store it is going to be a little difficult tostock up on 72 hours worth of food when i went on this preliminary damage assessment i will be honest i am quite certain that a lot of these people could not afford to buy 72 hours worth of food and water sothe insensitivity between the governors comments and the presidents comments after hurricane katrina the president said something similar after hurricane katrina he said in advance of the storm we warned people and it is our responsibility to get people prepared but if they did not listen there isnot too much we can do about it

delegatiof meeting to listen to the supposedly organized and wellprepared preparations that fema and the state of florida were putting in place to preposition supplies that people needed you would have thought that there would not be a kink in the works after the hurricane went through honestly the reports that i am getting are so disturbing price gouging of over 6 a gallon for gas in our
