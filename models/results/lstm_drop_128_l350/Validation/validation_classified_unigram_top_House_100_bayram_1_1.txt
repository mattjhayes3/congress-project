society today this body can join these courageous individuals and discard another needless impediment to the suecess of the hearing impaired and guarantee that they have equal access to the unitedstates telephone network at present there are many times often when it matters the most that a hearing impaired person simply camot use the telephone imagine not being able to call home from a friends house or use the phone in someone elses office or even to call 911 outside your own home in an emergency for many of the nations 4 million hearing impaired persons this is not some farfetched nightmare it is a daily reality in todays information and communication driven society the telephone is no longer a luxury item it is an essential part of our everyday lives our link to the rest of the world and vital to our business and social success as well ironically since the deregulation of the telephone equipment industry which promised to bring the wonders of modern telecommunications to all americans the percentage of telephones the hearing impaired can use has gone down significantly h r 2213 will reverse this dangerous trend the bill amends section 710 of the communications act of 1934 and the telecommunications for the disabled act of 1982 to require that all telephones manufactured or imported 1 year after enactment of this act be hearing aid compatible the legislation cxempts a few specialized applications such as mobile services and phones used for national security purposes further ii r 2213 is written to insure that it will not freeze todays technology and inhibit future innovation and development the bill only requires that phones be compatible it does not mandate any particular type of technology this legislation will keep pace with the dynamic fastchanging telecommunications and hearing aid technology fortunately it is very easy to make every telephone accessible to the hearing impaired person a simple virtually costless copper wire located in the telephone hand set creates an electromagnetic field which a telecoil in a hearing aid picks up allowing the users to hear loud and clear unfortunately for the nearly 2 million telecoll hearing aid users and the up to an additional 10 million people with latent hearing impairments a very large percentage of whom among this countrys growing elderly population too many phones do not have this tiny wire we simply cannot confine the hearing impaired to a world of silence requiring that all new phones be hearing aid compatible will help the healing impaired enjoy the freedom of access and

which they need the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance and the full com mittee on energy and commerce unanimously adopted this consensus language as an amendment in the nature of a substitute to h r 2213 the telecommunications for the disabled act of 1982 was a good first step in improving the hearing impaireds access to a limited number of telephones but now it is time to take a giant step further a step that will ensure that the hearing impaired are capable of using every telephone like we all do a step which will guarantee the hearing impaired equal access to the unitedstates telephone system this body has often shown its commitment to a strong national policy of universal telephone service for all americans today we can again demonstrate this unwavering

orphan drug law has played a really important role in encouraging the development of drugs for those limited patient populations which have rare diseases the pharmaceutical industry has responded quite favorably to the incentives in the law evidence clearly indicates that manufacturers have devoted substantial resources toward the development of orphan drugs as of last week the food and drug administration reports that 190 drugs have been designated as orphans under the lawand some 24 of these have been approved for market distribution it is important to note that the amendments considered today do not alter any of the key provisions in the law that have accounted for the industry research and development on orphan drugs instead the amendments are narrowly focused on reauthorizing the fdas authority to make grants for the development of orphal drugs the amendments will also help the fda improve its administration of the law and develop information on whether the incentives in the law should be extended to cover medical devices and medical foods the orphan drug programs greatest strength over the years is the widespread support that it enjoysfrom the congress the administration the patients and the pharmaceutical manufacturers however this consensus has been seriously tested over the past few months while possible changes to the current laws exclusive marketing incentives have been contemplated many suspect that the central goal of tile lawthat of encouraging the development of orphan drugsmight be compromised by the approaches suggested thus far to address perceived problems associated with a few orphan designations accordingly i am pleased that the decision was made to hold off trying to address these preliminary concerns regarding the scope of the exclusive marketing provision until more information is developed on whether changes to the current law are in fact needed moreover if changes are found to be necessary additional efforts must

program in 5 years development and testing of 188 orphan drugs has taken place and 24 orphan drugs have been approved this represents over five times as many drugs under development since the act as during the 10 years prior to enactment the orphan drug act was adopted in january 1983 and amendqd in 1984 and 1985 our years of experience now indicate that the reauthorization of the orphan drug grant program and some further fine tuning of the act is warranted h r 3459 will accomplish the needed changes the bill extends the authorization for the orphan drug grant program for 3 years fiscal years 198890 and expands the program to allow grants for the development of orphan medical devices and orphan medical foods these grants have proven to be very instrumental in the development of many orphan drugs they are awarded by the food and drug administration to independent researchers when no private pharmaceutical company will sponsor the testing and development of an orphan drug the results are then used to encourage pharmaceutical companies to sponsor the drugs the expansion of the grant program to include rphan medical devices and orphan redical foods is necessary because the lack of financial incentives deterring orphan drug work also affects these other products the bill also directs the secretary of health and human services to study whether the other provisions of the orphan drug act that encourage private company development should be available to companies working on orphan medical devices and orphan medical foods the bill also amends the orphan drug provisions in tile federal food drug and cosmetic act to assure that companies which choose to stop the production of an approved orphan drug provide notice to the fda 1 year prior to discontinuing the drug the 1year notice will give the agency the opportunity to try to secure another manufacturer so that patient care is not disrupted one provision in h r 3459 as reported by the committee on energy and commerce has been deleted from the bill before us that provision dealt with the 7year period of market exclusivity that is currently awarded to an approved orphan drug the purpose of market exclusivity is to protect the company that develops an orphan drug whose patent has expired or would expire by the time the drug can be tested and approved exclusivity assures such a company that it can offset some or all of its costs of development by recouping all possible revenues from the sale of the drug during the 7year period of exclusivity market exclusivity is intended to be an incentive to develop orphan drugs with little or no commercial value and inadequate patent protection however it can also be used to block competitors of drugs with significant commercial value due to the very high prices that are charged for them in such cases a company would seek to designate a drug as an orphan drug solely to get market exclusivity that would cut off competitors who might also seek approval of the drug in at least one case so far with human growth hormone market exclusivity has been used to block several companies that would like to sell the drug these additional companies are interested because the price of human growth homone is estimated to be 10 000 per person per year so even with this small market of 10 000 patients human growth hormone is a very successful drug in addition to human growth hormone there are several other drugs now under development where more than one sponsor is seeking approval because of the drugs perceived commercial value these commercially viableeven highly profitabledrugs fit within a strict construction of the orphan drug act but the congress never intended to extend the benefits of the act to such drugs while i believe this unintended use of the act must be stopped there is considerable disagreement over how the act should be changed because we do not want to jeopardize the reauthorization of the grant program i believe congress should pass these amendments and return to the problems of market exclusivity at a later time i am deeply concerned witr what i believe is the increasing use of the orphan drug act by companies to cover highly profitable drugs the act has already done enormous good in 5 short years we should not allow profit motivated companies to endanger this successful law i intend to follow

year 1988 alone for tax increases on the american people and it is 64 billion over thenext 3 years that is unacceptable it isunacceptable to the american people and it is certainly unacceptable to me and my constituents for the 20 years or so since president johnson signed the appalachian regional commission into law over 10 billion in federal state and local funding has been spent to improve the infrastructure and the quality of life of theappalachian region it has been a success there is no question about that i do not contest that but let me emphasize what i do contest what it says and this point was made in the legislation itself temporary program that is the term that was used as the region obtains the needed physical and transportation facilities and develops its human resources the congress expects that the region will generate a diversified industry and that the region will then be able to support itself through the workings of a strengthened free enterprise economy well i believe that they have done that i believe it is time now to sunset the legislation congress does not nor should it grant a federal government program immortality which seems to be the way we do around here on this side of the aisle we are criticized by saying that we have never seen a defense program we did not like well i think on the other side of the aisle we can say very clearly that they have never seen a program they could not spend money on and certainly never say one they wanted to terminate whether it was successful or unsuccessful i think that is really the issue the appalachian region still faces significant challenges no question but so does every other region of the country how about the farmers in the midwest how about in texas with the problems they are having today and not to mention other areas of the country that are solely dependent upon eda and the farmers home administration and not dependent on this special commission let us take a look at the commission itself fact by law the governors must hold two yearly meetings there are 13 two yearly meetings yet in 1984 they were unable to muster a necessary quorum of 7 so it cannot be that important to them according to the appalachian regional commission they have met only once a year for the last 3 years then came the talk from the president about eliminating the appalachian regional commission and then what happened well the best attendance in 6 years when we had 11 out of the 13 governors attend the last meeting so maybe the message is getting through we have gone far in addressing the needs which provided the impetus for the commission more than 2 000 miles of roads have been built more than 700 vocational schools have been built and more than 13 000 development grants have been made no question the question is should they continue to receive this unfair attention by the unitedstates treasury and by the taxpayers i think the answer to that is no for that reason i would urge adoption of this amendment and urge that my colleagues take this opportunity to eliminate just one program just one program in this budgetary process in fiscal year 1988"], [0.8685210943222046,

100247 having been approved by president reagan on february 11 1988 i am especially pleased to add my voice to those recognizing this 70th anniversary of the establishment of lithuania our observance of lithuanian independence day symbolizes our identification with the lithuanian peoples strong desire for democracy and freedom shared by people all over the world for more than a century the lithuanian people suffered under foreign domination trying vainly to win their independence on february 16 1918 lithuania was finally able to do just that this independence was soon followed by german occupation during world war i but thereafter and for the next 20 years until 1938 the lithuanian people were free that small nation then came under soviet domination during the course of world war ii and in 1940 lithuania was declared a constituent republic of the unitedstatess r thereafter during world war ii germany occupied this land once more for another 4 years until the end of the war unlike other nations after the war lithuania was unable to return to independence and was by 1945 firmly incorporated into the soviet union where it remains to this day while lithuania lost its independence as did many other eastern european nations the lithuanian people lost neither their desire for freedom nor their strong culture it is for these reasons that we recognize lithuanian independence day and celebrate it for those who cannot with this celebration we are reminding the soviet union that we have not forgotten their inadmissible policies with respect to lithuania and confirm to them our nonrecognition of lithuanias incorporation into the soviet union we must continue to work and remember the millions of people who are denied their basic human rights behind the i11322 iron curtain

contribution to american society we celebrate w th them and at the same time share their concern over the plight of their loved ones living in europe while the plight of lithuania and her people shows

recognize the illegal incorporation of the free and independ nt republic f lithuania into the union of soviet socialist republics in 1940 whereas the united states continues to provide accreditation to the charges daffalres of the republic of lithuania whereas the united states remains firmly committed to the principle of selfdetermination as contained in the final act of the conference on security and cooperation in europe also known as the helsinki final act an agreement to which the soviet union is a party whereas the people of the republic of lithuania struggle every day under soviet dominatioi whereas the united states condemns the soviet policy of forced russification ethnic dilution and religious and political persecution and whereas it is appropriate that the people of the united states who so strongly cherish the principles of independence and selfdetermination denied the lithuanian people by the soviet union join with the people of the republic of lithuania to

understand what we get out of sending millions of dollars billions of dollars forgive me around the globe when we have so many needs and wants and problems in our own country i believe in foreign aid i believe it is an extension of our foreign policy that we need friends in the world we need to help underdeveloped countries become developed we need allies we need access to raw materials we need customers for our exports we cannot sit in a plexiglas bubble isolated from the world and expect to survive as leaders of the free world but by the same token i have observed in my 131 years in congress that foreign aid is kind of a given we just shovel it out almost indiscriminately around the globe and we really never get an accounting as to where it is doing some good where it is not doing some good where it is helping and indeed where it is harming the alleged recipients most people think foreign aid involves immense waste and where it does not involve immense waste it involves facilitating corruption are these millions of dollars or these billions of dollars ending up in somebodys pocket or are they really going for the poor are they really helping develop the industries

we would like to know whether this multibilliondollar program serves unitedstates interests whether indeed it serves the interests of the recipients of this foreign aid so this amendment simply requires from the administration a report every 3 years that will provide us with countrybycountry information as to what aid is being given what other aid that country is getting from other donor countries how effective is that aid what are the trend lines in determining whether the country is developing or whether it is going down it is regressing all of this is a report card on a country specific basis on our foreign aid that would permit us then instead of just blindly shoveling the money out to make more discriminating decisions on who should get the aid how much aid they should get what countries the aid is being wasted in being ineffectively absorbed assimilated and it seems to me this is just commonsense accountability in our big multibilliondollar foreign aid program this

of contra aid only because i was convinced by the leadership that this was the best strategy in order to ensure that the longterm continuing resolution did not contain any aid to the contras however the conference agreement on this resolution contains 8 1 million in aid to the contras this brings to 15 1 million the amount that the unitedstates has provided to the contra terrorists since the signing of the guatemala accord this is absolutely outrageous at a time when we are faced with an unprecedented opportunity to bring peace to the war tom nations of central america the peace plan absolutely prohibits any outside aid to insurgent groups to vote for more aid to the contra terrorists sends a clear signal that the united states would jeopardize peace in order to support further bloodshed more civilian atrocities and loss of lives in supporting further aid to the contras we will only write another chapter in the tragic saga of an unending guerrilla war which has brought overwhelming misery to the people of central america i simply cannot in good conscience continue the war in this region when an opportunity for peace exists i urge my colleagues to join me in convincing the administration how serious we are about peace in central america i will vote against the resolution despite the fact it contains important programs that support human needs both here and abroad i would hope that the members of this body defeat this measure this nation needs a longterm continuing appropriations resolution without aid to the contras when this continuing resolution is defeated and with it the appropriation of funds ior the delivery of lethal supplies to the contras of nicaragua we will have returned to us a clean resolution which we can all support"]]}
