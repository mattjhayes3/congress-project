locking away 100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty once and for all let us make the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the centerpiece of this years tax cut"], [0.10939478874206543, 0.10939478874206543, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time opportunity

watching as the gentleman from arizona was making some of the comments tomorrow on the floor of this house as the gentleman has mentioned and so many other members have mentioned we are going to have a very very important vote i will be the one that will be handling this particular bill on the house floor because it is a bill that not only appropriates money for operation of federal agencies but it says okay what is the final thing we need to do to make sure that the budget being passed by congress one is a balanced budget it does not spend more than we take in secondly it does not spend any of this social security surplus to make sure that the money that we spend is only the money that comes from the other revenues of the federal government somebody said this is kind of like sanding a block of wood when one is trying to make something and one has to get all the pieces to fit in one gets that last piece and maybe it does not quite fit right so one sands it down and gets it down to the right size so it does fit in this is going to be sanding down the federal government so it fits within the goals of balancing the budget and making sure that we do not spend social security money in the process i think that is a worthy goal i have heard my friends on the other side of the aisle say oh we share that goal we want to balance the budget and not touch social security the president of the united states stood here in this house chamber in january and said he was going to save 68 percent of the social security surplus and not spend it now i know math and i know that if one saves 68 percent one spends 32 percent so the presidents plan was let us spend 32 percent of this social security trust fund we as republicans the majority party in the congress said mr president the right thing is do not spend any of it we know that for years it has been normal in washington d c under democrats and then as republicans as we were taking those final steps to balance the budget yes social security money was used in the process for far too long but that time is over now we can balance the federal budget without using any of that social security trust fund without jeopardizing the future security of people who are now retired or who may be retiring in the future at the same time this will be reducing the national debt so that people who are younger today will have the security of knowing that the national debt either will be smaller or nonexistent so they will not be stuck with paying it off so people today will know that the size of government has shrunk now that seems to me like that is what everybody is saying yet we had the meeting on the conferees of the bill this morning the bill that comes up tomorrow the meeting of the conferees and i could not believe it the things i heard from some other person i will not even name the person who said this one of the members of congress on the other side of the aisle today he said one we cannot afford these cuts we cannot do this 1 percent across the board cut then he said and by golly you are spending money out of social security i called him on the carpet frankly i said one i think everybody can afford a 1 percent cut but two if you think that is not enough if you think we would have to cut further to make sure we do not dip into social security why are you not proposing larger cuts instead of opposing the 1 percent cut he got kind of speechless at that point i notice this same rationale or lack of logic in the presidents comments i was reading the transcript of his comments today saying that he does believe in balancing the budget without using social security money and he wants to claim that republicans are dipping into social security so we would think therefore he would say cut spending further no he says raise spending more wait a minute if they claim we are spending social security money at this level and they want to spend more they would be spending more social security money they ought to be helping us they ought to be helping us reduce the size of government they ought to be proposing more than 1 percent across the board to save money but instead they want it both ways that is not right that is alice in wonderlandtype thinking i grew up knowing better i remember all the meals that we had in my family and it was a family of five kids my mom my dad my dad was hard working he would go to work during the day come home for dinner and go back to work what we would commonly have for dinner my favorite dinner when i was growing up was beans and cornbread if it was not that it was sliced diced potatoes and white gravy or kraft dinners we called them the macaroni and cheese i thought that we had those meals so often because they were so good well it took a while until i had five kids myself that i realized we had those meals so often because they were so economical they were healthy they were nourishing we got by fine but it saved money the family needed to save maybe we have some federal bureaucrats that need to be talking about beans and cornbread instead of doing the things that i have heard them say cabinet officers on tv oh there is no way that we can do a 1 percent cut tell that to mr and mrs america tell that to them when they have to sit around the table and have to balance the family budget and they have to make decisions a lot bigger than cutting 1 percent i remember when jimmy carter was president of the united states and he said we cannot spend so much money and so much expense on energy he said turn down your thermostats in the winter turn them up in the summer do not use so many lights conserve electricity families do that all the time maybe bureaucrats need some leadership at the top saying conserve things instead of spending more the president took 1 700 people on a trip to africa announced all these government giveaways and on top of that spent what was it 50 million 70 million for that huge entourage"],

lincoln was born on february 12 1809 in hardin county kentucky he was the son of a kentucky frontiersman and struggled throughout most of his younger years in both kentucky and illinois to earn a living and to learn abraham lincoln once claimed he had been educated by littles a little now and a little then yet for a man without what we would call a formal education abraham lincoln embodied every character trait that we aspire to attain it is because abraham lincoln possessed these traits that his name is synonymous with all that is great and good in america his name has come to symbolize commitment freedom honesty bravery and vision freedom because it was abraham lincoln who led the successful effort to free all slaves in the united states honesty because of his untarnished character and impeccable integrity which earned him the nickname honest abe bravery because he fought for and eventually gave his life to advance the principles that guided our founding fathers including that all men are created equal and he had the vision to preserve a more perfect union by guiding this country through its most divisive period the civil war when that war was drawing to a conclusion lincoln sought to bind up the nations wounds rather than punish those who had seceded from the union tragically an assassins bullet not only took lincolns life but with it killed any chance

congressional leaders is increased from six to 10 and the leaders are provided more flexibility in making those appointments finally the senate amendments provide that three rather than six of the

police officer but for my colleagues that are not familiar with it i used to be a police officer i have got some experience in the field of law enforcement i know that the best way to stop crime is to have consequences for ones crime if one commits a wrong one has to pay a price there is a price to pay if one decides to take behavior that is not normal or behavior that creates bad things in our society we all know we have to have a price as a police officer i saw that every day well tonight i want to talk about a couple things that just smack right in the face of trying to bring civilityand trying to cut down the crime rate in our society we all know that for many many many years in this country we have suffered unfairly at the hands of terrorism it has happened right here in these house chambers right here where my colleagues are sitting take a look right up there look up there on the roof do my colleagues know what is up there on the roof of the unitedstates house of representatives chambers there is a bullet hole right up there my colleagues can see it right here i will show my colleagues something else look i am not tearing up the desks in here but i want to show mycolleagues something this is drawer do my colleagues know what is right there it is a bullet hole that is a bullet hole a bullet shot in the house chambers theoretically this should be one of the safest places in the country this is the peoples house that is a bullet hole now how did that bullet hole get there puerto rican terrorists in march 1954 puerto rican terrorists they were there right there in the galleries and they opened fire they wounded at least five congressmen they wounded a number of other people but more than that they broke that cloak of security that we thought we had in the peoples house in washington d c we have to have consequences for those puerto rican terrorists that did that we have to have consequences for the next generation that followed in that terrorism group well what happened in the last couple of weeks our president president of the united states granted clemency for a number of puerto rican terrorists what do i mean by clemency it is kind of a fancy word he let them go he absolved them of their sins it is kind of like going to confession except they did not really have to confess all they had to say is take me on my word i am a person that should be trusted i will not do it again they were let free there will be a price to pay for letting terrorists walk free tonight let us talk a little bit about that organization what is that organization we are going to call it the faln faln what does it stand for it is the acronym for armed services of national liberation that is the only time i am going to say that tonight because i am going to use the initials faln the easiest way we remember it as we go through our comments is that it is a puerto rican separatist group now they really came to light here in 1954 here as i said i showed my colleagues the bullet hole right here i showed them the bullet hole in the roof of the unitedstates capitol of the house chambers well they struck again they struck again january 24 1975 by attacking another icon of american history new york city as a result of their terrorist act the 1975 bombing of the tavern in new york city where general george washington bid farewell to his troops in 1738 and left four dead as a result of this they quickly became the most feared domestic terrorist group in the united states the most feared group in the united states this is the same group that in the last week the president of this country let them go he gave them clemency he said okay you have been absolved you are free to go i have got a lot of comments about that a lot of comments from the law enforcement community my colleagues know how politicians sometimes say look i like to listen i listen before i make my decisions so logically if i have something dealing for example with prescription drugs we talk to seniors who are having problems with prescription drugs we talk to the pharmaceutical companies who are having troubles getting approval by the fda we talk to the fda we talk to the different parties how many law enforcement agencies were ever visited by the administration before they let these terrorists walk do my colleagues know what the answer is zero i am going to give my colleagues some statistics here in just a few minutes statistics i think will stun them as to how this decision was made and why this decision was made clearly a decision of that kind of significance is not made without some reason without some kind of purpose there is something behind the decision of that kind of significance we are going to explore that here in just a few minutes but let us talk a little bit more about the faln by the way i give credit to the usa today they did an excellent article last week on tuesday september 21 if my colleagues have a copy of the usa today take a look at it excellent article on this very issue in their heyday the faln members bombed public and commercial buildings bombed public and commercial buildings do my colleagues know the fear that went through this country just a couple of years ago with mcveigh in oklahoma city or the unibomber gosh i hope not 20 years from now that some other president steps up there and says we ought to pardon this fellow that bombed oklahoma city or we ought to pardon the unibomber out here you know 20 years is a long time to serve for a bombing there were people killed for these bombings there was fear put in the hearts of everybody in this country just like all of us now have fear about truck bombs my colleagues know what it was like when a moving van drove up by ones house 1 or 2 weeks after oklahoma city it instilled fear in us it is a fear that we should not have to live with in this country the only way the only way that we will move from that fear is to have consequences for the actions that drive that fear let me go back they robbed banks this is the faln this is the organization of which the administration released absolved gave clemency to last week this group in their heyday they bombed they robbed banks they held up armored cars and stole dynamite from a mining company in colorado that is my home state they took weapons from the national guard armory in wisconsin let me quote wayman mullins he is the author of a source book here is his book mr mullins book a source book the sources he has done a lot of research a source book on domestic and international terrorism he says this organization of which these many of these members were released last week they were dangerous dedicated and committed dangerous dedicated and committed as a former cop let me say that that is a very lethal combination a very lethal combination the faln was a group that got involved in a lot of things i think we should have some examples i am standing up here talking about bombings and armed car robberies and talking about other acts of terrorism in major cities new york city which put fear in the hearts of people throughout the country let me give my colleagues some specific examples so they will know exactly what these people who were released from prison last week because the president let them go we all should have an idea of what they did of what they were involved in among the faln actions october 26 1974 five bombings five bombings in downtown new york city more than 1 million in damage that was in 1974 december 11 1974 new york police were called to an upper east side building to collect a dead body the building was booby trapped a police officer was injured and lost an eye january 24 again the faln january 24 1975 fraunces tavern bombed four killed 54 injured more than 300 000 in damage june 15 1975 two bombs detonated in the chicago loop area february 1977 merchandise mart in chicago bombed millions in damages august 3 1977 mobile oil employment office in new york bombed one killed several injured november 1979 two chicago military recruiting offices and an armory bombed march 1980 faln members seized at the cartermondale campaign office in chicago and the george bush campaign office in chicago destroying property and spray painting separatist slogans on all the walls december 31 1982 four bombs detonated in new york outside police and federal buildings does this sound like a replay of oklahoma city maybe oklahoma city was modeled after some of what these people had done let me repeat that f our bombs detonated in new york outside police and federal buildings and remember this is the same group that called in a report of a dead body and boobytrapped the building so that these police officers and we all know cops we all have some in our families some that are our friends to walk in this building and hopefully be hurt that is exactly what the intent was of the faln now they had a leader their leader was morales williammorales morales escaped from a hospital in new york and fled to mexico guess what he did in mexico well he killed a cop shot a police officer guess what mr morales is now doing mr morales went to cuba whatishe doinghe just heard the news the news has gone to cuba that the president ofthe united states hasissued a pardon tothe terrorists of the faln so what has mr morales now done he has applied for a pardon he has now asked for clemency from the president of the united states if anyone were to have asked me a few weeks ago what the chances were of any of these peoplebeing granted clemency i would have said none zero zip that is not goingto happen now i do not know maybe this guy in cuba is going to get to walkaway from kill ing the cop from leading this organization it is disturbing it is really disturbing let us talk about a few of the people that have just walked edwin cortes born1955 sentenced in october 1985 14 years ago 35 years for conspiracy including the bombing of military training centers released by order of the administration elizam escobar born 1948 sentenced in february 1981 18 years ago to 60 years for firearms violations released by order of the administration ricardo jimenez born 1956 sentenced in february 1981 to 90 years to 90 years he served 19 ordered released under the clemency by the president last week robert maldonadorivera born 1936 sentenced in june 1989 to 5 years for his role in the 1983 heist of 7 1 million released in 1994 but the clemency that he got forgave his 100 000 dollar fine they not only let these people out of jail but if they owed a fine which they had not paid for the damage they had done the millions in bombings and the money they had stolen from armored cars and so on they do not even have to pay the money back any more take a regular citizen in our country who owes money to a bank in default i wonder if they get to walk away from that no they do not get to walk away from it but if an individual happens to be a terrorist with the faln then they can get this clemency let us go on and i will pick a couple more here juansegarrapalmer born 1950 sentenced in october 1985 14 years ago 55 years in prison and a 500 000 fine forconspiracy for bank robbery for interstate transportation of stolen money in connection with the 1983 armored car heist he will serve 5 more years and he gets out of the mediumsecurity prison norman ramireztalavera born 1957 sentenced in june 1989 for 5 years for a 1983 armored car heist he was released in 1994 but the clemency just worked out forgave a 50 000 fine well we will not go through all of them let me piok one or two others i luis rosa born 1960 sentenced in february 1981 to 75 years for conspiracy andfirearms violations carmen valentin born 1946 sen tenced in february 1981 to 90 years for conspiracy and firearmsviolations so i think we all get an idea of what we are dealing with we have a good ideaof what these people are they arenot our neighbor next door they are notregular joe or regular jane down the street these are bad people andthey id bad things and they hurt a lot ofpeople i do not know if any of my colleagues have beenwatching tv in the last couple of weeks but maybe they haveseen the widow or some of the surviving family members of those people bombed in new york city it reminded me of oklahoma city and i cannot for the life of me understand how a president can pardon those people we should make them pay the rice what rind of message are we sending out there what kind of message do we send to our young people what kind of message do we send to the rest of the world now some of my colleagues may ask why i am bringing up all these points that it seems so onesided that there must be some logical thinking behind this the president must have had a profound reason why he would take such a dramatic step to release these hardened criminals well before they were supposed to be released there must be some reasoning to it well i think before we go to what i think the reasoning is we ought to talk a little more about these convicts one of the things that the president quickly said after he found out he had created a firestorm in this country after he found out some people were going to say we want accountability mr president it is true that the president has the right to grant clemency that is under the constitution we are not contesting this right but the president owes it to the american people to explain to the american people why he is letting these puerto rican terrorists go well the answer came back because they have held up their hand and promised that they will not commit any more violence that they have re nounced violence as a part of their life it is amazing i used to be a cop it is amazing how many convicts and how many people we arrest that all of a sudden will find a new life all of a sudden they would promise me look i am not going to do it any more i have changed my ways i have changed my life really to determine whether that personis sincere or not wehave to do some research it is like anything else what are the facts what is the re search we have to look into the per sons background well it has happened on a couple of these people they tape recorded these convicts conversations in jail and what was interesting was that these convicts knew they knew their conversations were being taped so this was not anything secret they were not secretly disclosing their thoughts about violence they knew they were being tape recorded and they could havecared less theywanted people to know and i will give an example jailhouse statements of some of the faln members in october 1995 for example luis rosa alicia rodriguez and carlos torres told the chicago tribune they have nothing to be sorry forand they have no intention of ever renouncing an armed revolution another faln member granted clemency ricardo jimenez told the judge in his case we are going to fight we are going to fight revolu tionary justice will take care of you and everybody else now does that sound aike the average ease that a president should let out of jail well what does the fbi think about all of this what are their thoughts well first of all guess what has happened we in the united states congress think as i stated earlier that the people deserve an explanation of why the president and the administra tion took this action we do not doubt that the president has the authority as 1 mentioned earlier under the constitution to do this but he owes an explanation to the american people but guess what the white house all of a sudden grabs a paper and says executive privilege it is executive privilege executive privilege used to be used by the presidents when we had a secret we were afraid our foreign enemies would find out about like a military secret or a secret military mission or something with the central intelligence agency that the president to protect those secrets would say executive privilege what secret is to be protected here of a national threat none but there may be some political intent that ought to be protected but that is what the president has done they have said executive privilege they do not want there to be testimony to these federal agencies the president does not want them to go to the united states congress who are elected by the people of this country and to testify about this well the fbi was able to speak a top fbi official and i am quoting from the associated press of september 22 that is today this is hot off the wire this happened yesterday on the hill so let me read a couple of things federal bureau of investigation a top fbi official told congress he regards he regards and remember he is at the very top echelon of the fbi he regards puerto rican militants freed in a grant of clemency by president clinton as terrorists who continue to represent a threat to the united states of america here is the agency that we charge with law enforcement the agency that we charge with the priority investigation of terrorist acts and what do they say to the president well what they say i wish they could have had the opportunity to say before he released them i wish the president would have called them and asked them but he did not they say one of the top officials says they continue to represent a threat to the united states of america the article goes on gallagher that is the gentlemans name fbi gallaghers testimony marked the first time that federal law enforcement officials have testified on the issue also on hand were officials from the justice department and the bureau of prisons they were barred they were stopped they were barred from answering questions about clemency because of the white house executive privilege do i think they should be out on the street i think these are criminals and that they are terrorists and that they represent a threat to the united states says gallagher the top fbi officer let me repeat that do i think they should be out on the street that is the question i think these are criminals and they are terrorists and that they represent a threat to the united states how much clearer can that information be as my colleagues know we have to rely and we have had some problems we will talk about waco and some other issues we have had some problems with our law enforcement agencies but we have got a lot of good cops out there and we ought to rely on them and it is not just the fbi that said do not do it there are a lot of law enforcement agencies out there that said mr president do not do this these people remain a threat to our society they remain a direct threat to the united states of america listen to us that is what happened signed the paper let me go further the fbi was one of several law enforcement organizations opposed to the clemency asked about the continuing threat of the faln and its sister group in puerto rico gallagher ticked off a handful of more recent bombings in chicago and puerto rico believed to have been conducted by these very organizations clintons offer of clemency has come under fire from some who have accused him of making it to boost first lady hillary rodham clintons popularity amongst new yorks 1 3 million puerto ricans mrs clinton is considering a bid for the senate from new york in oh finally finally we are beginning to look at maybe there is some kind of reason some kind of profound thought behind such a ludicrous decision to let these terrorists back out on the street you know what i think the average puerto rican in new york and i am not puerto rican i am not from new york but you know what i think the average hardworking puerto rican in new york thinks about this they probably agree now i may get some calls tonight from some angry people who do not agree with me i expect that that is part of my job but i think there are a lot of american citizens out there regardless of whether they are puerto rican whether they are irish or scottish or african american or hispanic and there are a lot of ordinary americans out there that do not think this is right they think if you are a criminal if you are a terrorist you ought to be in jail and once we get you in jail you ought to stay in jail at least serve out the sentences that our justice system gave to you that is what i think the average american out there thinks regardless of their ethnic background we are americans we all want a country with low crime we do not want to have fear every time a truck pulls up that there is a bomb in the back of it we want to be able to go into a federal building we like to go into the house of representatives without seeing a bullet hole in the roof without seeing a bullet in the drawer we all think a lot alike do not dare try and separate us based on ethnic background do not dare try and say because we are hispanic american or puerto rican american or irish american or african american but for some reason just because of ethnic background we think these terrorists ought to walk that drive by the administration is wrong you are going down the wrong path let me talk a little more about why and quote the wall street journal friday august 13 same subject to understand remember earlier in the speech i talked about statistics you know do not just take scott mcinnis word for it let us take a look at what the statistics say about how many you know about the clemency how many times for example a logical question how many times has the president during his tenure been asked to grant clemency for prisoners and once we know how many times he has been asked how many times of that how many of those did he actually grant you know we measure a lot of times we measure a good governor you know on how many pardons they give i mean you measure people we have to have a tool of measurement well we have been kind of blessed in this case we have got the tools of measurement we have a darn good measurement out there to understand how rare it is this is the wall street journal how rare it is for a president to commute a sentence or offer remission of a fine as mr clinton did for 16 puerto rican terrorists this week consider the numbers supplied by the office of the pardoned attorney from the time he took office in january 1993 until april 2 of this year the most recent report from the pardon office mr clinton received the request for 3 042 petitions he received 3 042 petitions for clemency until wednesday out of that 3 042 he granted three three of those out of 3 042 in the 7 years or so that he has been in office now the wall street journal and i quote again from the wall street journal september 8 1999 and get a hold of this this almost makes me my gut wrench listen to this the puerto ricans had not even submitted a clemency request did not even submit a request and they got to be no 4 out of 3 042 now what fell out of the blue sky for this president all of a sudden to be interested in 16 puerto rican terrorists who had committed bombing crimes i remember very wetl the language in the speech that the president made in oklahoma city it was a very compassionate speech it was a good speech he cared every american cared about the tragedy that occurred in oklahoma city and i remember the president talking to us in his state of the union addresses about terrorism and the need to stop it we must not tolerate terrorism coming from that president what happened what fell out of the sky well i tell you what it points to it points to a united states senate race in the state of new york he has a lot of interest in that race up there i read to you earlier associated press hillary clinton 1 3 or 1 4 puerto ricans in new york state what is going on here are politics so driven in this country is the winning of elective office so demanding in this country and so important in this country that we are willing to put at risk american lives by releasing these 16 terrorists somebody ought to answer that question and you know somebody has answered that question i want to read you their answer before i read you this answer let me read one other thing that i think is important for us to consider out of the wall street journal friday august 13 mrs clinton of course hopes one day to take her place in the parade alongside new yorks other pols which we would say explains in a nutshell why her husband has just granted clemency to these 16 puerto rican terrorists against the advice of the justice department the fbi and the unitedstates attorneys office that prosecuted the terrorists back in the early 1980s all of these law enforcement agencies were consulted several years about the wisdom of releasing these 16 people all advised against it well let me wrap it up with a letter i am going to read the letter verbatim it is a couple pages long i know that it requires some patience for you to listen to this i mean i have been speaking for a while here but it is important because i think it really addresses from the heart somebody who has experience in the atrocities that these terrorists have committed somebody who understands that terrorism must have consequences that the people that commit that misbehave in our society must be punished and there must be punishment that means something you cannot just slap them on the hand after they rob the bank and serve a few years and let them go especially considering there were only 3 042 requests and only three got granted well let us read that letter who is it from it is from the new york city police commissioner howard safir and as i said i am reading the letter verbatim with last fridays release of 11 of the 14 faln terrorists president clinton has committed an illadvised and egregious error he has broken the fundamental rule in addressing terrorism he has broken the fundamental rule in addressing terrorism never negotiate deals with terrorists never negotiate deals with terrorists now obviously when i repeat a sentence that is mine it is not repeated in the letter mr clinton has sent the message that the lives of american citizens and of the heroic police officers who defend them are disposable as the police commissioner of new york city i represent 40 200 officers and take the responsibility for the safety of 7 4 million residents i have become all too familiar with the violence that has been perpetrated by the members of the puerto rican separatist group known as the faln and the manner in which my city and my officers have suffered at the their hands during a 9year reign of terror the faln was responsible for at least 150 bombings that killed six people and injured more than 70 the brunt of their viciousness the brunt of their viciousness was aimed at the people of new york city who endured more than 70 attacks and accounted for four of the deaths and 57 of the injuries what others have termed a war of liberation new yorkers know that to be a war against the innocent the targets of this organization included restaurants at lunch time hotels banks and department stores while the passage of time may have faded the memory of some i cannot share that perspective i have seen the devastating consequences of these destructive acts i have spoken with several victims of the attacks and their families people like joseph connor whose father frank t connor was killed in the bombing in the fraunces tavern i know too well the permanent scars that are carried the permanent scars that are carried by detectives rocco pascarella richard pastorella and anthony semft during a wave of terror that saw the faln detonate four separate explosive devices across the city in the course of a single hour these men suffered horrific injuries defending new york city from these terrorists cost these heroes cost these heroes their hands and legs and left them permanently blinded and painfully maimed no one can commute the life sentences no one can commute the life sentences that the faln imposed upon its victims some argue that the felons to whom mr clinton offered clemency are not personally responsible for their organizations violence i cannot agree the crimes for which these men and women were convicted included robbery the plotting of bombs and the possession of dangerous weapons one of the petitioners possessed a loaded firearm and more than 10 pounds of dynamite in a january 1998 letter ronnie l iedelman a deputy bureau chief from the department of justice acknowledged that several of the petitioners offered clemency were arrested in 1980 for their involvement in 28 bombings and in a recent letter to this newspaper former assistant unitedstates attorney deborah devaney recounted her experiences with the petitioners a former federal prosecutor in chicago who spent years bringing criminal cases against the faln terrorists ms devaney describes capturing several of the petitioners in a van loaded with weapons and videotaping several others making bombs that they planed to use at military installations i must question the unusual progression of events that surround this clemency offer mr clintons offer to the faln members represents only his fourth clemency grant out of more than 3 000 applications filed since 1993 it was extended before any of the 16 agreed to renounce violence the president made his offer over the objections of the federal bureau of investigation the bureau of prisons and the unitedstates attorneys in illinois and connecticut the states where the 16 were convicted in my 26 years as a justice department official i never heard of a clemency report being delivered to the president over the strenuous objections of these agencies let me repeat that in my 26 years as a justice department official i never heard of a clemency report being delivered to the president over the strenuous objections of these agencies the white house has tried to defend the presidents decision in part as a response to the urgings of church leaders in particular the white house has invoked the name of cardinal john oconnor as a staunch suppor ter for the petitioners release this is all the more perplexing given that in letters and through his top aides the cardinal has said he never backed clemency for these terrorists mr clinton erred grievously in failing to follow the recommendations of his own federal agencies the house of representatives the 17 500 members of the international association of chiefs of police the 295 000 members of the fraternal order of police and countless others who voiced their outrage at this decision the united states must make clear that it will never again make deals with terrorists that was a letter read verbatim from the new york city police commissioner howard safir the question that needs to be answered of which the white house has claimed executive privilege is why these terrorists why three out of 3 042 petitions being granted and now we go to the fourth and why new york state mr president if it does not have anything to do with that unitedstates senate race in new york state you ought to waive your executive privilege although i do not think it exists under these particular circumstances but regardless of that argument you ought to waive it and you ought to answer the american people you ought to go to the american people you do not hesitate one minute to have a press conference when you are touring foreign countries whenever you have something to say you go right to the microphone you are a good speaker you are not afraid to address the american people certainly you have addressed them on a number of controversial issues you ought to address them on this one you ought to explain because what we see on paper what we saw walk out of that prison cell what we now see on the streets of america what we fear in the hearts of every american is terrorism that exists today and you have not answered it and you ought to answer

by people at home to do we are trying to do things that pass the smell test to where we can look at the american public and say we have something in mind and what in mind we had was that we should not

years we have found out that not one penny of social security went to fund the government for the first time in 39 years so i would like to go from this chart of spending to this chart of the history of the social security raid as you see here back in 1983 it really began we began on a yearly basis of taking 80 90 billion dollars and taking what was the surplus in social security what was given because people had to give the government their money with the understanding that government had some fiduciary responsibility to take care of this in fact what has happened is all this money has gone into what was called a social security trust fund well i would submit to you that this trust fund is smoke and mirrors because in fact all of the money has been spent it is all gone and the american public knows this 638 billion so the 27 years worth of social security that i have paid in and the 27 years worth of social security that my wife has paid in and gosh knows how many years that my parents worked probably 50 years they are now counting on a system that essentially is counting on us today to pay for their retirement rather than putting the money in where it is supposed to be

boy scouts of americas congressional charter i urge all of my colleagues to join me in sending a clear message that the civil rights movement is alive and well in the united states of america and that this congress does not support discrimination in any form contrary to what some of my colleagues on the other side are alluding to we are not saying that the boy scouts are bad we are saying that intolerance is bad i was a girl scout one of my sons was a boy scout i know the value of scouting and that is why i believe that scouting should be available to all boys not just some boys i am not standing here today to override the supreme court the unchangeable fact is that towards the end of june the supreme court upheld the boy scouts discriminatory policy so i stand here not to ask if the boy scouts have a right to a discriminatory policy but to ask if their discriminatory policy is right in 1939 marian anderson an african american opera singer was invited to perform at constitutional hall then operated by the daughters of the american revolution another chartered organization the dar said that marian anderson could not perform at constitution hall because she was black as a result then first lady eleanor roosevelt resigned her dar membership and coordinated a concert for marian anderson at the lincoln memorial 75 000 people attended and ultimately the dar changed its policy of discrimination simply because an esteemed organization holds a belief does not make that belief right it was wrong for the daughters of the american revolution to discriminate against african americans then and it is wrong for the boy scouts of america to discriminate against gays today my colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggest that they speak for the average american that the vast majority of americans support intolerance they are wrong this poster alone will show the headlines from the newspapers across this nation that are reporting the reaction to the boy scouts position of intolerance it is clear that opposition to the boy scouts intolerant policy is not a fringe movement it is part of the mainstream belief that intolerance in any form is unamerican from fall river massachusetts to broward county florida from chicago to san francisco american cities american private corporations nonprofit organizations schools churches families are saying no to intolerance in the city of chicago the boy scouts can no longer use city parks schools or public sites because their policy the boy scout policy of intolerance conflicts with the citys existing nondiscrimination policy in fall river massachusetts the local united way voted overwhelmingly to withdraw support from the boy scouts private companies are also finding that the boy scouts intolerance is unacceptable among other corporations textron inc knight ridder and others have pulled their support from the scouts because when people stand up and say intolerance is wrong they do make a difference one of those people is steven cozza a teenager from petaluma california where i live steven as a 12yearold boy scout working to earn his eagle scout badge became aware of the intolerance policies against gays in scouting and as a scout he decided he was 12 years old he decided to do something about it that was 31 2 years ago since then steven and his dad scott cozza neither one of them is gay they have nothing to gain except they know that intolerance is wrong they started an organization called scouting for all scouting for all is a campaign a national campaign encouraging the boy scouts to change their policy to date they have gotten more than 53 000 signatures to support change of the policy steven cozza supports abolition of the scouts prohibition on gays he knows that it is wrong it is wrong to exclude some boys based on sexual orientation and it is wrong to teach other boys by example to be intolerant perhaps some of my colleagues believe that intolerance is okay i do not and neither do millions of people across the nation who live in the cities that have stood against intolerance or worked for the companies that have withdrawn their support or made contributions to the organizations that no longer support scouting my colleagues would do well to get outside the chambers and talk with parents in montclair new jersey who are circulating a petition opposing the boy scouts policy they should also talk with the elected officials of san jose california who say that boy scout intolerance is incompatible with their city laws repealing the boy scouts federal charter is a sensible and reasonable way for this congress to take a stand against intolerance and not have it look as if our nation supported intolerance a charter is an honorary title that congress awards to organizations that serve a charitable patriotic and educational purpose but to me there is nothing charitable there is nothing patriotic and it certainly is not a value we want our children to learn revoking the charter does not cut off federal funding for the boy scouts it does not change their tax status revoking the charter sends a clear message that congress does not support intolerance i call on my colleagues to join me in support of h r 4892 together we can show the american people that like them this congress does not accept intolerance as a

misstatements today about the sugar program not only today but in the discussions that have been held over the years i think it is really unfortunate that so much of this comes from a theoretical discussion which is purported to be a government report called the gao study i think that it is important when we look at these studies to look at the response the department made with respect to each one of the assumptions that were propounded by the gao report the most significant of it is this use of the words world price anyone who has studied this particular issue will know that the world price is nothing more than a dump price there is no such thing as buying sugar at 8 cents or 9 cents a pound it is only where the excesses the surpluses of all of these government programs all over the world have no internal domestic source to sell then they go out to the world market and they dump it it is absolutely unfair to talk about our sugar program and relate it to the world dump price if we are talking about the cost of sugar to an ordinary family in the united states let us look at the chart here let us look and see what the world price is for sugar in the developed countries we see all of these countries here norway belgium denmark austria italy sweden switzerland ireland france all of these other countries and way down at the bottom here the united states retail price at 43 cents at the top here 86 cents that is what we are talking about when we talk about the cranberry production and the cranberry juice that we were supposed to feel sympathetic about in an earlier discussion we are talking about a retail price in the united states which is significantly lower than what the price is in other countries throughout the world 8 cent 9 cent sugar is unreal in terms of our own domestic market what are we talking about we are talking about killing an industry i cannot think of anybody interested in fairness and support of our farmers in support of agriculture wanting to kill a whole industry in order to somehow fall prey to this mythological idea that they could buy 8 cent sugar in the world dump market it is just not happening i think the real way to look at this situation is what is happening to the sugar prices today we who have sugar production in our districts know that the price has catapulted from about half of what they were perhaps 10 or 15 years ago our farmers are struggling they are in despair i have one sugar company on the island of kauai that is about to close if we do not find a resolution to this problem none of the hawaii sugar is in this commodity market i am not here because we are in that market where we are going to benefit 1 penny from any loan we are restricted from that program but i am here talking about sugar as fundamental industry in this country that has a right to exist to be a part of our economy as any other farm product in this the united states why kill off this industry on a myth prices have gone down over the last year to maybe 18 cents for the people who are producing it but what happens to all of the other products that are using sugar the cakes and the cookies and the cokes all the prices have gone up 15 20 percent there is no economist worth his salt or her salt that can argue that the price of sugar being low is a good thing for america because it is going to lower the prices of the commodities it has not li 1515 the prices of all of these commodities have gone up so the argument that the gao makes that the consumers are paying through their nose because sugar is such an expensive item has absolutely no substance in terms of the rationale for their argument if their argument were true then the prices for all of these commodities cakes cookies and whatever would have gone down there is not one item that we can find on the shelf today in the grocery stores where the prices have gone down that uses sugar as a substance for their production so it seems to me that we have to be together in this discussion about agriculture we cannot pick out one particular farmer we do not have any multibillionaire sugar producers in my state they are all small hardworking farmers who are just making a living so let us stand for the agricultural industry in this country and not kill sugar because somebody does not like the law that we passed in 1996 that was designed to benefit all commodities we have heard a lot of misinformation today about the unitedstates sugar program i want to present a few facts during the 1990s wholesale refined sugar prices fell 11 percent during the same period the retail price of refined sugar increased by 1 percent and the prices of manufactured food products with sugar as a major ingredientcandy baked goods cereal and ice creamrose by 23 to 32 percent since the start of the 1996 farm bill wholesale refined sugar prices are down 26 percent but retail sugar prices have not dropped at all and sweetened products prices are up 7 to 9 percent it is clear that it someone is making a killing it is not the sugar farmers american sugar farmers are in crisis in my state of hawaii only three sugar companies are still operating in 1986 13 operating factories were operating and sugar was grown on all of the four major islands today sugar is produced only on the islands of maui and kauaiand the survival of these companies and the fragile rural economies of these islands are severely threatened by historically low prices this year hawaii sugar farmers are receiving the lowest prices in 18 years for their sugar those who would like to kill the unitedstates sugar program cite the socalled world price of sugar of 8c a pound no onenot even countries that use child laborproduces raw sugar for 8o a pound this world price is in fact a dump price for excess sugar that bears no relationship to the actual cost of producing sugar the dump market represents the subsidized surpluses that countries dump on the world market for whatever price that surplus sugar will bring a study by lmc international estimated the weighted world average cost of producing sugar during the 11year period of 1983 84 through 1994 95 to be 18 040 a pound the actual level is almost certainly higher now because of inflation since that time even though unitedstates sugar growers are among the most efficient in the world they cannot survive when they receive prices on the order of 170 to 190 a pound twothirds of the worlds sugar is produced at a higher cost than in the united states even though american producers adhere to the worlds highest govemment standards and costs for labor and environmental protections unitedstates beet sugar producers are the most efficient beet sugar producers in the world and american cane producers rank 28th lowest cost among 62 countriesalmost all of which are developing countries with deplorable labor and environmental practices unitedstates consumers pay 20 percent less for sugar than the average for developed countries our average retail price for a pound of sugar43 is far below the more than 80e paid by consumers in norway japan and finland the average price paid by consumers in the european union is 520 of course unitedstates prices would be even lower if the retailers and manufacturers did not absorb all of the benefit of the lower prices producers have been receiving over the past three years is the price of sugar a problem for the average american family i dont think so sugar is so cheap that you can pick up packages of it in restaurants and no one cares the average american works 2 3 minutes to purchase a pound of sugar are the opponents of the unitedstates sugar program responding to concerns of consumers clearly not they are responding to pressure from big businesses that want to increase their profits further still at the expense of american farmers the dan miller amendments use consumer cost as an issue to mask the primary motive which is allow cheap foreign sugar into the unitedstates market so that the mega foodconglomerates can make more money the unitedstates sugar and corn sweetener producing industry accounts directly and indirectly for an estimated 420 000 american jobs in 42 states an for more than 26 billion per year in economic activity defeat the miller amendments that seek to destroy the unitedstates sugar industry i also wan tot respond specifically to the contention by mr miller that the unitedstates sugar program costs consumers 1 9 billion per year first the deeply flawed study by the gao has been thoroughly discredited by the usda economists at the usda have serious concerns about the gao report which suffers in a numbers of regards relative to both the analytical approach and the resulting conclusions usda concluded gao has not attempted to realistically model the unitedstates sugar industry the validity of the results are therefore suspect and should not be quoted authoritatively as with the 1993 version of this report the gao assumes that food retailers and manufacturers would pass every cent of savings along to consumerswe have convincing evidence that this will not happen mr miller is also very critical of the moves by the usda to remove excess sugar from the domestic market in order to stabilize the price of sugar and thereby avoid very expensive forfeitures several factors account for the excess of sugar on the market good yields due to favorable weather increased imports and schemes that undercut the foundation of the sugar import quota such as importation of stuffed molasses a product with a high sugar content which is made into refined sugar and importation of dumped sugar via mexico under the reduced nafta tariffs the miller amendments to prevent the usda from making purchases to reduce the supply of sugar and to avoid forfeitures will cost the government money purchases cost less per ton and will avoid a much larger volume of forfeited sugar purchases instead of forfeitures for the 132 000 tons the government purchased this year will save taxpayers 6 million in avoided forfeitures sugar farmers like other farmersare suffering prices for most crops are at or near alltime lows the government has stepped in to avert a disaster in rural america by providing over 70 billion in payments to other farmers since 1996but no assistance has been given to sugar farmers moreover sugar farmers have contributed 288 million in marketing assessments to reduce the deficit and prior to the recent sugar purchase the sugar program has operated at no cost to the unitedstates treasury it angers me to hear members talk about the sugar program benefitting only a few wealthy sugar barons i can tell you that the small growers who supplied the now defunct hilo coast processing company were not and are not sugar barons now many are not even farmersthey are unemployed and the thousands of people who work for or whose jobs depend on the remaining sugar companies in hawaii are not rich they work hard at their jobs and have to pay their mortgages and save to send their children to college in hawaii we have over 6 000 jobs dependent on the sugar industry these are good jobs that pay a living wage include health benefits retirement and other benefits unitedstates sugar producers are providing these jobs while complying with unitedstates labor and environmental law unitedstates consumers benefit from the unitedstates sugar program they benefit from the stability it ensures and the access it provides to quality sugar produced by unitedstates companies a strong domestic sugar industry contributes to our economy by producing jobs the demise of the unitedstates sugar industry would mean the loss of these jobs to sugar producers overseas that do not have labor or

solution in the balkans but rather is the problem milosevic has started and lost four wars this past decade with slovenia with croatia bosnia and herzegovina and finally with nato over kosovo he may now be preparing his fifth war this time against montenegro and its democratic reformist government milosevic has run an authoritarian state suppressing dissent threatening his opponents purging the army and police and manipulating the electronic media to misinform the serbian public but in spite of all of that yesterdays dramatic election results from belgrade show the serbian people have had quite enough of slobodan milosevic it is clear from the independent and opposition sources that the democratic opposition of serbia has won a decisive victory the center for free election and democracy has reported that serbias democratic opposition has won 58 percent of the votes cast as compared to 32 percent for milosevic milosevic should respect the wishes of the serbian people and step down no manipulating or manufacturing of ballots from kosovo or montenegro no fiddling with the constitution to stay in power through next summer no desperate moves of violence against montenegro kosovo or citizens of serbia in order to bring stability to southeast europe and unlock the economic potential of the region milosevic must relinquish power to a new democratic government in serbia i

act supports the democratic opposition by authorizing 50 million for promoting democracy and civil society in serbia and 55 million for assisting the government of montenegro it also authorizes increased broadcasting to yugoslavia by the voice of america and by radio free europe and radio liberty the acts strength is that it follows the strong and effective policy crafted by the administration and the demonstrated will of the serbian people themselves as evidenced by yesterdays vote the legislation codifies the socalled outer wall of sanctions against yugoslavia by multilateral organizations including international financial institutions it also authorizes other measures against yugoslavia including blocking yugoslavias assets in the united states prohibiting the issuance of visas and admission to the united states and prohibiting strategic exports to yugoslavia loans and investment and militarytomilitary cooperation it is important to note that yesterdays encouraging election results from serbia do not negate the need for this legislation milosevic may not relinquish control making support for democratic forces nongovernmental organizations and free

of the sky or the nations power grid will go down or the worlds financial markets will crash our nations business community has heard these predictions as well thats why as we get closer and closer to the year 2000 the business community is accelerating its already massive effort to bring their computer systems into y2k compliance and it is a massive effort it has been estimated that by the time all is said and done american businesses will have spent 50 billion on addressing y2k problems however we must all admit that despite their best efforts and despite the extraordinary amount of money invested in bringing their computer systems up to speed something somewhere will go wrong its inevitable today our world economy is so interdependent and tied to computers that a major y2k failure almost anywhere in the world has the potential to result in minor or major disruptons everywhere when this day comes we must have in place an effective legal framework for dealing with all the litigation that will surely result from these expectant y2k failures or disruptions the y2k special committee in the senate has stated that litigation could cost as much as one trillion dollars i dont know about my colleagues but i would like to see our nations business community spend their resources on fixing the problem rather than litigating it indeed despite the fact that we are 7 months away from the year 2000 more than 80 y2k lawsuits have already been filed can you imagine how many frivolous lawsuits will be filed once weve had the first failure or disruption that is why i am supporting h r 775 this bill sets in place an effective legal framework that will sift through the frivolous lawsuits while allowing the meritorious lawsuits to precede h r 775 encourages a fast fair and predictable mechanism for resolving y2k related disputes it encourages resolutions outside of the courtroom so that problems can be fixed quickly what this bill will not do as some of my colleagues will argue it does is encourage people not to fix the problem in fact there are no protections for people or businesses that act irresponsibly or negligently in preparing for the y2k problem this bill makes sure that businesses that attempt to fix their y2k problems are not unfairly punished by being exposed to frivolous lawsuits but it still holds people accountable if they are negligent or irresponsible if someone intends to sue a company for damages related to y2k the bill would give the company 90 days to fix the problem before a lawsuit could be filed in addition defendants would only be liable for their portion of the damages if the court says a company is responsible for 10 percent of the problem then the company pays 10 percent of the damages i represent a hightech district in the state of alabama where the y2k issue is at the forefront of a lot of peoples minds state officials in alabama have recently announced that our state is behind schedule on the y2k problem businesses in my district are concerned not with the possibility of experiencing y2k failures because the large majority of these businesses have made the goodfaith effort to commit the resources necessary to reach compliancebut rather these companies are concerned with the threat of frivolous lawsuits in a recent letter to me one company wrote at very considerable expense to us our cornpany has gone to great lengths to make sure that we are y2k compliant but we do expect problems will be passed on to us a mountain of litigation could create untold amounts of time and expense which could be the hole that sinks the ship the american people are looking for leadership on this issue not just empty rhetoric h r 775 is a responsible step in the right direction it allows our legal system to work as it shouldmeritorious lawsuits will precede and frivolous lawsuits will be stopped as i said earlier the year 2000 is only a little over 7 months away the clock is ticking and time is running

blood and american tax dollars if we have no national interest in kosovo why did we lose so many lives in europe in two world wars if we have no national interest in kosovo why did we spend billions of tax dollars on the reconstruction of europe through the marshall plan in the aftermath of world war ii it seems that we have forgotten that the balkans are an integral part of europe and that kosovo as president bush first enunciated is critical to the peace and stability in the balkans senator dole got it right when he testified before the committee on international relations advocating our engagement and involvement in kosovo i am quoting senator dole it is in americas interest to have a stable democratic and prosperous europe as did ambassador jeane kirkpatrick who served so well as our u n ambassador under president reagan she stated at that same hearing and again i am quoting i think that peace and security and the human rights of the people in the region and the future of nato and a democratic peaceful prosperous europe are all in the balance in kosovo we should be proud that it was the united states that helped nurture prosperity and democratic institutions in europe in the latter part of this century for that investment truly changed the course of history and has not just benefited europe but our nation and our people the prosperity that we have enjoyed in this decade can be partially traced to the reality of a europe increasingly democratic in terms of its political institutions with economies based on free market principles we are joined at the hip let us be clear about that but it is to our mutual advantage an expanded european union represents a future of unprecedented peace and prosperity for a continent that has been ravaged by war throughout recorded history and the genocidal ethnic cleansing of milosevic is perhaps the final challenge hopefully to achieving that vision so when we ask what our national interest is in kosovo it is not simply kosovo it is more much more it is about europe and beyond europe in the socalled christmas warning of 1992 it was president bush that warned milosevic if he attacked kosovo that the unitedstates would support a military intervention if necessary early in his administration president clinton confirmed the bush warning it was the conclusion of both administrations that conflict in kosovo would destabilize the entire region and potentially threaten all of europe it would indeed be tragic at this point in time to have defeated fascism in the 1930s and the 1940s to have prevailed over communism in the 1980s only to lose the peace at the end of the century we may do just that by a unilateral withdrawal at this point in time i submit that the action would be irresponsible dictators worldwide would cheer milosevic would have won we will have crafted a much more frightening and troubled future the kosovar albanians would be condemned to permanent exile or death and

before you call it genocide and im reminded of the book the greatest generation by tom brokaw and im proud to be a part of that generation and one of the things we failed to do in that generation was to nip genocide in the bud it happened we let it happen and we stood back and we did nothing let us not sometime in the future reflect back on this day with the same regrets expressed so eloquently by

letter that i received recently from just such a senior in my district who certainly is worrying she is from holland pennsylvania which is the little town that my family moved into in 1955 she wrote this letter to me just a few weeks ago a couple of weeks ago dear congressman greenwood i never thought that i would come to this time in my life and findmyself neglecting my health out of sheer necessity i am a widow 70 years of age my medical problems require drugs that amount to over 1 000 per month i am enrolled in aetna unitedstates health care which has a cap on prescription drugs of 500 a year after filling out the prescriptions my cap was met i am in pain daily and i cannot correct this problem because of financial difficulty i have stopped taking prilosec which costs her 285 each month zoloft approximately 100 a month losomax another 100 a month xanax approximately 100 a month and zocor 100 or more i need these drugs filled monthly and i simply cannot afford them i am also in need of pain pill vioxx which costs 89 and i have not been able to purchase it i have cried myself to sleep over this dilemma i had to visit my pulmonary doctor who diagnosed me with fullblown asthma and chronic bronchitis my doctor told me that i cannot miss a day taking my medication for my lungs i take zevent two puffs twice a day flovent two puffs twice a day and albuterol 2 puffs every 4 hours the prescription for each is 98 times three lasts 2 weeks so 98 every 2 weeks for each of these three medications that is 600 per month right there i cannot stop taking this i tried and ran into breathing problems again i also must take zithomax for chronic infection 89 i must keep this on hand always also my ophthalmologist prescribed xalton for glaucoma which i must take faithfully nightly another 89 the drugs i must take average about 800 per month the other drugs i need for osteoporosis reflux and hiatal hernia anxiety and depression high cholesterol and nerves i had to eliminate them and i can feel my health decliningeach day i tried a generic brand drug for my lung infection and i had to end up taking three zithromax as the generic did not help me my problem is that i make 200 too much per month to qualify for assistance you figure this out i have two friends who make 200 and 250 less than i do per month they are paying 6 for all their prescriptions because they qualify for the program they are gettingi help with their electric bill they are being well taken care of they are able to go out to dinner weekly and on a bus trip now and then i can do none of this my money is going to prescription drugs i just pray that some good congressman like you could make the guys in washington see what this drug problem for the aged is doing to us we worked hard all of our lives and then have to come to this that is a pretty persuasive argument i think a pretty poignant letter from a real woman who lives in my district a 70yearold widow who is only able to use every penny of her income simply for the drugs that she has to have to stay alive and then she neglects her other needs and so her cholesterol problem her anxiety her depression her pain her osteoporosis all of those conditions go unchecked because she does not have this benefit that is why all of us in washington who care about this issue are trying so hard to get this done and that is

bipartisanship and that is why this bill that we are supporting is bipartisan now unfortunately in the special order that came before us my friend the gentleman from new jersey and i will give him credit for this he comes to the floor every night just about and makes a speech about prescription drugs but what is so discouraging to me is the level of partisanship there are reasons for there to be differences between the presidents plan the democrats plan and the republican plan because this is a hard problem to solve andit takes different kinds of thinking from different perspectives there are reasons why the republican plan is different this is a complex issue one of those differences between the two plans is that we think that you need catastrophic coverage we think that it is important that when some of these drugs that can cost 10 000 to 20 000 per year you cannot stop the coverage at 2 000 and let the individual be on their own becausethat is not going to help my constituent my constituent will not be helped by that because she will run out of money and not only will her insurance coverage not be sufficient but now the medicare coverage will not be sufficient and that is not good enough when you look at the presidents plan and when you look at the republican plan there are differences i happen to prefer the republican plan but the fact of the matter is they are more alike than they are different what we have got to do this year is we have to be bipartisan and make sure that the bipartisan bill is adopted by the house that we take ideas from other members we negotiate this with the president and get it done when you see members of congress come to the well of this house or sit in committee hearings and meetings and when you hear them looking for common ground and looking for a bipartisan approach when you have republicans and democrats supporting the same kind of legislation then you know these are serious members who care about 70yearold

most of their time emphasizing the differences contrasting the republicans and the democrats this lady does not care whether the bill is a republican bill or a democratic bill she wants a bipartisan approach that gets the job done when you see members constantly emphasizing partisan differences then you have to conclude that these are members who are not interested in solving the problem they are interested in winning elections they are interested in political gain and leverage and i think that is what is shameful we need to get this done in a bipartisan fashion the bipartisan bill we are here

protect the internally displaced ethnic albanians within kosovo those who have not yet been slaughtered must be protected we must not allow them to suffer the same fate as so many other kosovars unfortunately we did not act soon enough to address the murderous actions by serbia and today thousands of people are dead because of international indifference we ought to create safe havens for ethnic albanians inside of kosovoand we ought to do it as soon as we can this would prevent further expulsions and mass killings this will not be easy and will not be without a loss of lives but it must be done we cannot allow the leader of one nation to wipe out an entire ethnic group at the end of world war ii and the holocaust the world made a collective promise to all future people we said never again we ought to mean it however it is unlikely at this point that air strikes alone will bring an end to this conflict we ought to consider other options including the use of ground forces we now have to be prepared to forcefully enter kosovo and occupy the area in order to make the safe return of refugees possible this is not a task that we ought to take lightly but it is one that must be done nato must continue to assess the situation and make adjustments as they see fit this resolution gives the administration the flexibility to respond quickly to any new developments and continue their efforts on all fronts to resolve this conflict i urge support for this resolution"], [0.0009638667106628418, 0.49903613328933716, 0, "i yield myself the balance of my time i would like to focus some attention for a few moments on section 4 of h r 807 this section is particularly important to our nations veterans i want to thank again the gentleman from florida who is the chairmannow of the subcommittee on civil service and also thank again the gentleman from maryland the ranking member for their strong support for this section and revision that has been provided space in this bill when the committee on government reform marked up h r 807 i wasable to add section 4 in order to perfect the language of public law 105339 the veterans employment opportunities act which passed in the last session in 1998 that bill which i had the pleasure of introducing with others in the house expanded veterans employment opportunities and strengthened veterans preference in our civil service system it was an important bill to our nations veterans in fact it was called the most significant veterans preference legislation since world war ii and was strongly supported by every one of our nations veterans service organizations a key provision of that act allowed veterans to compete for civil service jobs even if they did not have the status as federal employees before the act was passed competition for many jobs was limited to current federal employees however after the act was passed the office of personnel management raised an important technical issue opm held that individuals who were selected under this provision could not be appointed to competitive service unless they already had what is known as competitive status instead the office of personnel management instructed agencies to provide these individuals with excepted service appointments as excepted service employees these veterans would have in fact fewer rights than their colleagues in the competitive service most importantly as excepted service employees these veterans would not be able to compete for other agency jobs under internal merit promotion procedures this was not what i intended this wasznot what congress intended congress intended that veterans appointed under this provision would have all of the rights of their fellow employees in a particular agency the majority and the minority staffs of the subcommittee on civil service and of the senate committee on veterans affairs met with the office of personnel managements experts to discuss this problem section 4 enacts language suggested by the office of personnel management under this language in fact veterans who are selected under the access provision of the veterans employment opportunities act will receive competitive appointments and competitive status that is what we intended and that is what congress wants they will have the same rights as their coworkers we have discussed this situation extensively with veterans organizations and various service groups represented by veterans they are keenly interested in resolving this problem and have urged congress to act as quickly as possible to correct and clarify this situation and cure this problem they strongly support section 4 and i urge all members to support section 4 and also this legislation in closing this bill is really about fairness the federal reserve already allows federal employees who transfer there to receive credit for their years of service at other agencies congress should provide reciprocal rights under the federal employees retirement system for those federal reserve employees who transfer to other agencies particularly when the cost is negligible likewise there is no reason to deny individuals who transfer to the federal reserve the right to withdraw their funds from their own thrift savings plan accounts section 4 of this bill as i stated is extremely important to our nations veterans it will again clarify the meaning of the veterans employment opportunities act which was passed in the last congress congress intended that those veterans selected for federal employment under the access provisions of that act would have the very same rights as their coworkers and compete for other jobs both republicans and democrats support this legislation as does the administration we have worked very closely with the federal reserve board the office of personnel management the federal retirement thrift investment board and others in crafting the language before the house of representatives this morning h r 807 as amended is a good piece of legislation a bipartisan piece of legislation and a fair bill it is important to our federal employees at the federal reserve board it is also important to those who have served our nation i urge all members to vote for h r 807 as amended i have no further requests for time and i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0012262463569641113, 0.5012262463569641, 0, "i rise in strong support of this resolution and thank the distinguished gentleman from california for yielding time to me i had an opportunity to speak on this resolution when it was before the committee on international relations and i also would like to convey the fact that i speak as the chairman of the house delegation to the nato parliamentary assembly greece and turkey are two valuable and highly valued members of the nato alliance as far as the united states is concerned we have been concerned for some timeabout the obvious friction that has existed between these two nato allies we also have been very concerned about the fact that the european union slammed the door in the face of turkey when they provided their initial interest expression of interest in beceming a member eventually of the european union in part allegedly because of greek opposition to such membership out of the adversity out of the tragedy of the earthquake that occurred in turkey greece responded in a wonderful neighborly fashion it was well received by the turkish people and the turkish government it has provided an opportunity for improved relationships between these two valuable countries and i want to commend both the government of greece and the government of turkey for the way in which they have reacted to the adversity as mentioned perhaps a few minutes ago when later a less severe earthquake took place in greece turkey was quick to respond indeed turkey sent earthquake teams to taiwan when they had their recent earthquake i do hope as the gentleman from new york chairman gilman said that this will lead us to an opportunity for further cooperation and for reaching a peaceful settlement of the longstanding dispute related to cyprus between greece and turkey and that it in general will provide an opportunity for increased cooperation and friendships between those two countries so at a time when we often come to the house floor to lament things that are happening it is good to commend our friends in greece and turkey for the extraordinary conduct that they have displayed in the wake of the recent tragedy i urge my colleagues to support the resolution"],

this section to any faithbased institution that is pervasively sectarian this is very simple the supreme court ruled in 1988 they cannot give dollars directly to pervasively sectarian organizations esgentially organizations that are thoroughly religious that their secular and religious purposes are so intertwined they cannot separate them we are picking up that language of the supreme court in its 1988 case to try to make this bill constitutional i want to be clear my amendment does not stop federal funds from flowing to faithbased organizations that is happening today it has happened for years and it will continue to happen under my amendment what will be different is under my amendment we will follow the profound principles of the first 10 words in fact the establishment clause of the bill of rights that say our founding fathers did not and would not want direct federal dollars to go directly to houses of worship churches and synagogues there are many supporters from the joint baptist committee to the american jewish committee of this amendment let me just say some things that will happen if it does not pass first they will obliterate a 200year wall of separation between church and state convenience or even good intentions are not good enough reasons to turn our back on the first 10 words of the first amendment of the bill of rights secondly without my amendment passing this bill will let a church or religious organization take federal dollars and in the decision of hiring people for that federally funded program say no they are not good enough we are not hiring them because they are not as an american citizen of the right religion in our opinion i fjnd that is offensive to the concept of religious freedom and respect and independence in this country third i think they are going to harm these religious organizations by inviting massive federal regulation of them and finally they will create great dissension as these organizations compete for federal dollars"]]}
