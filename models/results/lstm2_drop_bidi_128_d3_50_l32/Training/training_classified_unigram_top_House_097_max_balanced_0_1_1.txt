loss falls on the person or institution who dealt with the forger now however a committee dominated by banking lawyers is out to change this rule so that a consumer victim of check forgery would bear the first 50 of loss from his own pocket under draft no 8 of the new uniform payments code a consumer would be liable for the first 50 arising from loss or theft of a check payable to him that was cashed by a forger the new uniform payments code would hold consumers responsible if they obtain control over the check and it was subsequently lost or stolen from the consumer this is a radical change from the uniform commercial code in effect in all 50 states which holds that anyone whose check is stolen and whose endorsement is forged has no liability for the loss under present law the entire loss falls upon the person or institution who cashes the check for the forger under the new uniform payments code an elderly women who is mugged after taking her social security check from her mailbox would be out the first 50 if the thief forged her signature and cashed the check many of our senior citizens can barely scrape by from month to month on their meager social security payments yet insensitive lawyers seek to take millions from people where a couple of dollars may mean the difference between eating or going hungry social security check forgery is no small matter in 1981 the social security administration referred 35 405 social security and 10 953 supplemental security income check forgery cases to the secret service if each of the consumers in these 46 358 cases were held to the 50 liability these recipients would be out over 2 3 million social security checks are just the tip of the iceberg however according to federal bureau of investigation estimates about 30 million checks are forged in this country every year an estimated loss of these forgeries to financial institutions and merchants is 4 billion at 50 per check it is possible that up to 3 5 billion of the 4 billion loss could be shifted to consumers this is truly a radical proposition not only is it a departure from longstanding and settled principles of law but it undercuts sound banking practices bankers preach know your endorser to their tellers every check issued by the united states bears a warning to the person cashing the check to require full identification and enforsement in your presence current law encourages good banking practices by placing the risk of loss on those persons in the best position to stop forgery losses no forgery can succeed unless the forger finds someone willing to give cash or merchandise for the forgery the financial institution or merchant stands face to face with the forger and has the power to thwart the crime by saying no if someone gives something of value to the forger then it is only fair that they bear the consequences of their action the new uniform payments code is being drafted by the 348 committee of the permanent editorial board for the uniform commercial code the board works closely with the national conference for commissioners on uniform state laws which works to have uniform laws adopted by the states the board and national conference have been most successful in pressing for the adoption of the uniform commercial code the uniform commercial code has been adopted in all 50 states and governs all aspects of commerical transactions the new uniform payments code would replace those sections of the uniform commercial code that govern the payment and handling of checks and drafts and the allocation of loss for forgeries and unauthorized payments the 348 committee named for those sections of the uniform commercial code which govern checks and negotiable instruments is dominated by lawyers with close ties to the banking industry of the 11 members of the committee 7 are members of firms who represent banks an eighth member is employed by a chain of department stores the law firm of the chairman of the 348 committee is the registered lobbyist for the consumer bankers association the law firms of three of the committee members represent either citibank or its holding company citicorp one member of the committee sits as a director on the board of europeanamerican bank and two of his partners are directors of the bank of new york and marine midland bank other banks who are clients of the committee members firms are first national bank of boston fidelity bank philadelphia national bank crocker national bank manufacturers hanover trust co first national bank of atlanta first national bank of chicago marine national exchange bank security marine bank capital bank and new england merchants bank there is no way that a committee dominated by banking lawyers can objectively rewrite our nations banking laws the 348 committee simply does not adequately represent the interests of the elderly and the average citizen it should come as no surprise that the 348 committee discussion draft of the new uniform payments code states on its cover that public disclosure is prohibited and that the draft should not be generally circulated or its substance disclosed given the proposal it contains this desire for secrecy is as understandable as its proposal is outrageous it may well be that the laws governing our nations banking system need some refinement in the past decade many changes have come about retail charge volume on bank cards has increased over sixfold in the past 10 years debit cards and automated teller machines have experienced explosive growth over the past 2 years with the number of cards increasing by over 500 percent networks of shared terminals permit a customer of one bank to obtain money from an automated teller machine hundreds of miles from home check truncation in which checks written by a bank customer are not returned is growing at a geometric rate electronic deposits and telephone transfer of funds continue to grow all these factors are changing the nature of our nations banking system next year the consumer affairs subcommittee will extensively study these changes however there is one thing that i can assure you will not happen and

chemical weapons in various parts of the world i rise this afternoon to express my full support for the zablockibethune amendment which would delete 54 million for production of binary chemical weapons from the defense department authorization bill my colleagues are no doubt familiar with the horrors of such weapons chemical weapons kill in a particularly ghastly and indiscriminate way their victims are more often than not civilians recently the reagan administration has chastised the soviet union for its alleged use of tricothecene dubbed yellow rain in kampuchea laos and afghanistan eyewitnesses of these alleged attacks report that victims died a horrible death suffering from bleeding eyes burning of the skin dizziness bleeding gums and a variety of other symptoms before finally succumbing from explosion of their internal membranes in effect drowning them in their own blood ironically the administration has followed these charges against the soviets with a call for a new aeneration of chemical weapons of its own claiming that such weapons are necessary to deter the soviets from future use i find this argument that reduction of chemical weapons is only possible through increased production to be painfully reminiscent of the administrations stance on nuclear weapons steppedup production of such weapons might well lead the world into a period of chemical arms proliferation sure y the most fruitful avenue of pursuit for an administration truly committed to the control reduction and if possible elimination of chemical weapons would be through negotiations unfortunately the administration has refused to resume the bilateral negotiations with the soviet union that stalled in mid1980 as recently as this past month before the united nations special session on disarmanent soviet foreign minister gromyki submitted a proposal for resumption of negotiations intended to put an end to the chemical weapons arms race before it begins many are convinced that this latest soviet proposal contains language concerning the important issue of verification that represents significant movement from previous soviet stances e yet in the face of this new initiative the administration has merely reaffirmed its intent to produce a new generation of chemical weapons i would ask my colleagues to consider what message is sent by a refusal to negotiate directly on the one hand and an effort to renew production of chemical weapons on the other how else could such a signal be interpreted than as another step in a chemical arms race moreover i am concerned about what it would say to the world if we follow our call for condemnation of the soviet use of chemical weapons with the resumption of a massive chemical weapons program of our own after a 13year moratorium we should be wary of the dangers of proliferation of these arms and care ful to avoid opening the floodgates of a new round of chemical weapons production before these weapons become available to terrorist groups and unstable governments who would think little of using them to advance their own ends we must stop production and use of chemical weapons once and for all i hope my colleagues will

origin at its peak this industry provided more than 1 300 jobs and has contributed nearly 100 million in wages and taxes to the local economy since 1967 because of a market shift away from its mainstay of mechanical 17jewel watches to quartz analog timepieces however the industry will not survive unless it can adapt to that market shift since 1980 more than half of the industry has closed down and employment has dropped to fewer than 300 persons existing tariff incentives are inadequate to justify territorial production of quartz analog watches the mainland watchcase and bracelet industry partly reliant on the insular industry might also not survive the insular industrys demise to prevent the death of this industry i am today introducing legislation which if enacted would place the industry on permanently solid footing the major features of this bill provide for the elimination of the current limitation on foreign material content and creates a supplementary incentive tied to assembly activity in the territories all this can be accomplished without a single new budget outlay the supplementary incentive would result in foregone duties up to 5 million through 1982 and thereafter be indexed to growth in the onp projected annual costs are not expected to exceed 3 5 million by encouraging new and existing insular assembly operations this legislation would avoid indirect budget costs associated with letting the industry fold no private sector alternatives to existing watch industry employment in the insular possessions is foreseeable in my own district the unitedstates virgin islands the watch industry could disappear as early as this year or next without these new tariff incentives this would come at a time when the president is pursuing a program of

declaration of a stronger loyalty to our nation and to the peoples government 3 how can i help advance this cause on april 6 1917 the united states of america declared war against the forces of the kaiser william ii because german sub marines had been blockading and sinking american ships in the atlantic ocean soon after this a clerk in the house of representatives in washington wrote the americans creed on april 3 1918 the house accepted this creed written by william tyler page as the offictal pledge to support our nations constitution laws and governmert and vow to defend these principles against all enemies let us see how well william page has ex pressed the sincer6 feelings of all loyal americans"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.999832139161299, 0.0001678608387010172, 1, "madam

act of 1982 the purpose of this legislation is to clear away unnecessary antitrust uncertainty that may deter efficiencyenhancing joint research and development undertakings by firms in the united states joint research undertakings can avoid needless repetition of basic research and increase the return on available research dollars indeed with the path cleared for appropriate joint activities firms will have an incentive to increase total investment in research and development and undertake research projects that they could not finance on their own many of our industries are faced with ever more sophisticated foreign competition leadership in these industries requires not only that firms stay on top of the latest technological developments they must forge ahead with new discoveries of their own many of the foreign competitors of american firms benefit from government research or other subsidies not available to finance the research of our own companies this legislation will grant no government subsidy nor will it create any antitrust immunity it simply will create a certification mechanism whereby the department of justice can examine in advance proposed joint research and development activity and certify appropriate activity against public or private antitrust exposure if the certificate is erroneously issued or if subsequent antitrust violations are uncovered the department may after appropriate notice to the joint researchers lift the certificate and restore full antitrust protections even during the period of certification injured private persons could still obtain actual damages if they could establish violations of the antitrust laws an anomaly in our antitrust laws is that firms with a relatively small market share that could lawfully merge under our current merger guidelines may be fearful of undertaking joint research and development activities such joint undertaking among competitors could be viewed under some judicial holdings as per se violations of the sherman act notwithstanding the freedom of such firms to take the ultimate merger step in some cases where the cost of basic research is high a joint undertaking may offer the only opportunity for firms to undertake the research in such cases procompetitive results may attain from the venture even though the total size of the firms exceeds merger guidelines here again uncertainty as to antitrust exposure could deter firms from undertaking such a cooperative venture the antitrust division has tried in recent years to clarify some of the uncertainties by issuing an antitrust guide concerning research joint ventures in november 1980 while this guide has provided constructive counsel for some firms it can provide no assurance of how courts may ultimately interpret the antitrust laws in private antitrust suits which today constitute over 90 percent of the antitrust suits filed in this country the joint research act will allow the justice department to put its guide to work in a way that will provide concrete assurance to businessmen not only as to the departments views but also how those views will hold up in potential private litigation it will eliminate the harassment potential of private treble damage litigation without granting any antitrust immunity or undercutting the protections afforded by sound antitrust policy through this balanced legislation we hope that we will take asmall but significant step to encourage efficlencyenhancing joint research and development that can enhance the longrun competitive position of domestic firms"],

we are also unaware of the silent pain which if felt by families and friends of the individuals who have been classified as missing in action in the past too often pows and mias have been neglected by

aware of the problems former prisoners of war and the families of mias must face since the return of 566 pows by north vietnam in 1973 the unitedstates government has been criticized for doing little to account for the 2 500 individuals who are still missing until recently there has been a lack of concerted effort within the government to take action to locate these individuals however it is not entirely the fault of the unitedstates government the vietnamcbe government has been uncooperative it is believed that north vietnam has retained the remains of hundreds of unitedstates sericemen in warehouses however on july 8 hanoi returned the remains of three unitedstates servicemen and has expressed a willingness to continue searching for other remains furthermore vietnamese refugees have reported having seen americans in vietnam unitedstates government officials speculate that these americans are being held against their will prisoners of war from the vietnam war comprise only a small
