they are really good people caught in a very bad system congress has nibbled around the edges of reform and there are some congressional rule changes that may do the same but to help move toward real reform i am introducing a package of four bills dealing with the need for real limits on campaign spending as well as slamming shut the revolving door on lobbyists that allows too much foreigngenerated influence and money inside this legislative branch my proposals are as follows first a sense of congress resolution that recognizes that the supreme court erred and was not complete when in the case of buckley v valeo they stated that free speech equaled money that no matter how much you spent was okay because money was equated with free speech well if that is true the converse is true if you do not have the money you lack free speech and more and more americans are being shut out of the highest levels of lawmaking in this country because they simply do not have the money to compete my second bill is the constitutional amendment itself that would give congress and the states the power to limit the contributions and expenditures made by in support of candidates for federal state or local office that is a tough proposal but it is one that i think our children and grandchildren will thanks us for 0 1900 the third measure is the ethics in foreign lobbying act of 2006 which would prohibit contribution expenditures by foreignowned corporations and would establish within the federal elections commission a clearinghouse of public information regarding political activities of foreign principals and agents of foreign principals it was interesting that some major russian interests were involved with mr abramoff as this scandal unravels we are going to find some very interesting characters sitting at the bottom of that heap finally the fourth bill is the foreign agents compulsory ethics and trade act of 2006 which would impose a lifetime barf on highlevel government officials from representing aiding or advising foreign governments and foreign political parties it imposes a 5 year prohibition on representing aiding or advising foreign interests including commercialinterests before the government of the united states it is not enough just to shut the gym to former members who are lobbyists you have to get at the heart of the problem campaign

whole californiamexico border just a few weeks ago we discovered almost a milelong tunnel half on each side of the border in my district we all like to take credit for things in our district but this is one that i do not take credit for e 1315 it was a very sophisticated tunnel the way it was constructed the way it was shored up the way it drained water and it was even airconditioned we found 2 tons of marijuana that was left behind who knows what went through that tunnel whether it was people drugs or potentially weapons of mass destruction thinking about that and looking at the reaction we had in san diego over those tunnels i thought we should slightly amend this bill to authorize the ondcp to coordinate with all relevant agencies to combat border tunnels that are used to smuggle drugs people and could potentially be used to smuggle terrorists and their weapons specifically between california and mexico i it gives the office authority to join in the development and implementation of

that with all of the fences that we are building double fences triple fences walls what we have here is an easy way under all of those fences that we are building so we need to have a far more coordinated policy there is not even a law against tunneling under the border there are laws for smuggling and for i other parts of the crime but not specifically for tunneling under our international

other side of the aisle in support of this legislation the bill before the house does the right thing for the disaster victims of florida and louisiana but it does wrong truly wrong for the new york victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks i would like to appeal to my colleague on the other side of the aisle to join me in trying to reverse the unfair taxation on grants to the victims of 9 11 specifically the businesses as we go forward when thousands of lower manhattan small businesses were on the brink of complete failure as a result of september 11 and the terrorist attack against our country these businesses accepted federal recovery grants but were then told months later that those grants would be taxed and treated as income that in my opinion wrongful taxation was the straw that broke the back of many small businesses in new york after 9 11 and it continues to this day to be a burden on small businesses who were forced to take out loans to pay taxes on disaster recovery grants granted it was not a fema mitigation grant but it was a disaster recovery grant so it was in the same feeling or in the same purpose as the legislation before us what causes me so much concern today is that we have sought the same treatment the exact same treatment for 9 11 victims for more than 3 years that the members are seeking today for victims in their states along with the gentleman from new york and the bipartisan delegation of new york i have introduced legislation to reverse taxation on the 9 11 aid grants we have offered amendments to reverse this taxation with the active support of the gentleman from new york ways and means members and others from the new york delegation we have testified before the committee on rules made numerous speeches before this body sought hearings for the legislation and held countless events to seek action from house leaders to reverse this wrongful taxation on 9 11 aid grants we have been trying for more than 3 years to have the small business victims of 9 11 treated fairly but this body has not found a way as yet to advance that legislation again i am appealing to my colleagues from florida and louisiana to help our constituents as they are helping theirs today now today we are watching a bill sail to the floor for passage without a hearing without a markup in committee without any of the months and years of effort that the new york delegation and business leaders from new york city have put into seeking redress for 9 11 disaster victims that were treated unfairly and wrongly let me be absolutely clear that i find no fault with the repeal of wrongful taxation on the recovery grants for florida and louisiana victims of disaster i feel they are entitled the purpose of disaster relief is to relieve them to get that money back in the community to help them restore and be made whole not to tax it but i do find fault with the exclusion of 9 11 victims in this bill when we have fought so long and so hard to achieve the exact same fairness for them if the federal government should not collect taxes on aid to hurricane victims then it should not collect taxes on 9 11 relief grants which is truly the worst disaster that this country has ever suffered it is an act of war we are still suffering from that terrible terrible action against inhiocent people i again want to make clear that i am supporting the legislation i would like to place in the record a report from the joint committee on taxation where they estimated that approximately 268 million was sent back to washington in the form of taxes on the relief grants following 9 11 it is unfair to new york and to those who suffered the most from the terrorist attacks against our nation i call upon the authors of this legislation and

major strategic vulnerability for our nation with nearly half the energy supply of our country now imported and that reliance grows every day my amendment has a goal of taking a small step toward

allowing us to maintain a temporary shield from increased costs on oil the purpose of my amendment only allows it does not require the secretary of energy the discretion of including ethanol biodiesel and other alternative fuels in the strategic fuel reserve so it takes the word petroleum out although petroleum will remain the major fuel but it offers some encouragement albeit mild to try to get us to think differently about a new future for our country every one of us has that responsibility including the secretaries of the interior and energy this amendment is neutral if the secretary decided to secure alternative fuels it would be paid for by the exchange or sale of crude oil from the existing reserve ethanol and other biobased fuels are two of the ways in which america can truly become more selfsufficient in fuel production and usage this chart shows just over the last 20 years or so our petroleum consumption and how much more of it is imported to now well over half it is projected in another 15 years our imported petroleum will rise to 75 percent by 2050 most easily drawndown reserves in the world will have been drawn down not just by our country but by nations like china for example which are using more and more petroleum every yeax we simply cannot live in the 20th century any more it is now the 21st century if we look where we are importing our crude reserves they are coming largely from the middle east followed by mexico venezuela nigeria many places that have difficulties politically increasing use of renewable fuels will result in significant economic benefits to our nation as well for example biodiesel production is dramatically increasing going from about 5 million gallons in 2001 to five times that much this past 2003 and congress expanded the existing reserve in 2000 to include the northeast home heating oil reserve there is absolutely no reason that biodiesel cannot ultimately become part of that reserve and help us to transition off our increasing reliance on petroleum the use of biofuels makes environmental sense allowing us to better preserve our natural environment biodiesel for example contains no sulfur or aromatics associated with air pbllution and the use of something like biodiesel provides a 78 5 perbent reduction in co2 emissions when compared to petroleum diesel currently the spr the reserve contailis a number of domestic and foreign crude oils and those fuels are stored separately adding additional storage capacity for other fuels could be planned very easily by the secretary of energy and the secretary of the interior the national farmers union for example is supporting this effort people across this country really know america has to change this is one small baby step it is just encouraging language it asks that those responsible for the current strategic reserve think more creatively take the time to look at these alternative fuels and help put america on a more energyindependent course without question the farmers across this country need new value added and with the price of oil skyrocketing and it really will not go down it has not gone down in the last 30 years if you look at the progression of oil pricing in the spot markets for e cample and now these fuels are competitive there are many states taking the lead take minnesota take iowa take nebraska take the dakotas there are many places that have seen the future and are developing it i think we here in congress should respond to that inventiveness and that desire of the american people to invent their way to a new fuel

that one of the reasons we want to do this we should be so anxious that china increases its reliance on nuclear power is that if they fail to do that they are going to have to continue to use more and more fossil fuels particularly petroleum and we know it already is occurring virtually all of the incremental production in the world is being consumed by china which has a rapidly growing economy and that is what is helping to drive up the price of oil in the world to the skyrocketing the skyhigh levels that it is today if we are not able to help with this kind of technology china would perhaps have to go back to other kinds of fossil fuelusing plants not only does it have environmental degradation but it obviously hias enormods impact on the economy of the rest of the world for all of those reasons this is a very bad amendment ill designed ill directed and ill timed and i urge its defeat i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0002122819423675537, 0.49978771805763245, 1, "in support of

making the motion and i never voted for president clinton i was not a big fan of president clinton but you are right also he came from extraordinary circumstances and rose to the highest position in this country i mean he and i apparently had very different lifestyles growing up i never consumed a drop of alcohol and when i was underage i never not only did not inhale i never smoked there are so many things different in our backgrounds and he ought to be an inspiration to every child out there whether leaning toward being republican or democrat that president bill clinton with the things that he had in his background could reach the nations highest office i mean any of you should know that it is not out of your reach either it is extraordinary what he accomplished but there is an old political adage that says democracy ensures that a people govern no better than they deserve in 1992 and 1996 whether tny of us like it or not america deserved bill clinton and that is who we elected it is now a fact he has been a president it is now a fact that his birthplace should be a historical site and i understand the concerns of the gentlewoman from florida my friend maybe there will be a room dedicated to all the money made from the uae but that is someone elses determination the fact is it is a historical place it deserves that designation and hopefully people will be inspired for

of jobs could be lost and we are inserting ourselves or would be inserting ourselves into something that has been worked out among all the parties in a way that is in the best interest of both active
