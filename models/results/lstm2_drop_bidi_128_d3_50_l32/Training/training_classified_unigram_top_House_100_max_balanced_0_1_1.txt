contains 10 206 billion in new discretionary budget authority and 9 128 billion in new discretionary outlays these figures are under the budget authority and outlay targets that were set pursuant to the economic summit agreement unfortunately in the process of making the economic summit budget reductions we have had to reduce transportation programs by approximately 3 percent more than i believe was required to meet our targets the coijferees had agreed to add language mandating the sale of railroad redeemable preference share equity instruments held by the federal governmentwhich will yield an outlay savings of 240 million unfortunately while the omb and cbo ruled this to be a legitimate savings they would not credit these savings to the transportation bill this scorekeeping gamesmanship will have important real life consequences for our important transportation programs i find it unfortunate that the economic summit agreement participants chose to leave the final decislonmaking authority to such an improtant task to the unelected officials at omb an cbo i hope we do not make that same mistake in the future i am submitting for the record at this point a table summarizing the

stewart b mckinney homeless assistance amendments act of 1988 which is an emergency effort to assist the homeless in our country this legislation represents the continuing commitment by congress to assist the homeless which now number in excess of 3 million persons in the united states this conference report represents the bipartisan efforts and hard work of members on both sides of the aisle in both the house and senate the house and senate each had programmatic and perfecting amendments included in their versions of h r 4352 to the existing mckinney act which was first enacted into public law 10077 july 22 1987 this conference report represents the congress continued efforts to make these existing mckinney act homeless programs more flexible in order to serve the needs of the homeless in our country i must emphasize that this bill is an emergency effort to assist the homeless we have developed this legislation in order to address the emergency and acute needs of the homeless this bill does not make the mckinney programs permanent rather it only reauthorizes the mckinney programs for 2 more years fiscal years 1989 and 1990 this bill does not focus on the causethe lack of affordable available housing to lower income americans the answer is clearly more permanent housing which is affordable and available to lower income persons the housing subcommittee will soon consider much broader approaches to provide permanent housing for the 1990s last year we were successful in authorizing the mckinney act programs and today we continue our efforts by reauthorizing and perfecting the homeless programs contained in the stewart b mckinney act this conference report provides emergency assistance to the homeless and is not the cureall for the homeless rather it expands upon and perfects the initial mckinney act which we enacted last year and which has been operating over the last 9 months today we are reauthorizing the vitally needed homeless programs contained in the mckinney act for fiscal years 1989 and 1990 this conference report represents a joint bipartisan effort by both the majority and minodty the funding levels authorized in the bill do not exceed the levels assumed in the fiscal year 1989 concurrent budget resolution the bill reauthodzes the mckinney programs and provides a number of programmatic changes which are based on the hearings conducted by the housing subcommittee on january 26 1988 and based on subsequent meetings with advocates for the homeless service providers and state and local officials i believe that the provisions contained in this conference report will make the program that we designed in the mckinney act more workable in many communities throughout our country the conference report contains 10 titles of which the banking committee has jurisdiction over five titles titles i through iv and title x titles i through iv deal with the hud and fema mckinney homeless programs and title x deals with technical and conforming amendments to the 1987 housing and community development actpublic law 100242 the conference report authorizes a total of 633 8 million for fiscal year 1989 and 682 8 for fiscal year 1990 of which 410 1 and 426 2 million is authorized in each respective fiscal year for the hud and fema homeless programs under the banking committees jurisdiction these authorizations for the hud fema programs for each respective fiscal year 1989 and 1990 are allocated as follows 120 and 125 million for the emergency shelter grants program 100 and 105 mllion for supportive housing demonstration programsincluding transitional housing and permanent housing for handicapped homeless programs 10 and 11 million for the supplemental assistance for facilities to assist the homeless program 50 million in each fiscal year for section 8 10year moderate rehabilltation for single room occupancy dwellings 129 and 134 million for the fema emergency food and shelter program and 1 1 and 1 2 million for the interagency homeless council this conference report contains a budget compliance provision and requires the general accounting office to submit an annual summary of all mckinney homeless programs to congress the conference report also extends the interagency council for 3 years and strengthens the communication and distribution of information about the federal resources available under the mckinney act through a bimonthly bulletin and by requiring that states designate a state homeless contact person the conference report also requires the national fema emergency food and shelter board to develop alternative formulas of distributing program assistance based on data on longterm unemployed workers in each state the conference report also contains technical and programmatic provisions which clarity and strengthen the hud homeless programs to better assist the homeless changes are made the comprenhensive homeless assistance plan which is submitted by local governments and states which strengthens communication and information about the mckinney homeless programs and includes a requirement that a good faith assurance that recipients will administer a policy to ensure that their homeless facility is free of illegal use possesslon or distribution of drugs or alcohol numerous provisions are included to october 19 1988 perfect the existing mckinney programs and allow greater participation in all hud mckinney programs in addition to the changes in the mckinney act we have added provision in this legislation that make a number of technical and conforming changes to the 1987 housing authorization bill that the president signed on february 5 1988 as well as correcting some erroneous interpretations that hud has taken with regard to certain provisions in the 1987 housing authorization bill these technical changes to the 1987 authorization bill reflect what the congress had in mind in developing last years housing and community development atithorization bill finally four issues raised by the conference report should be clarified first the lease and grievance rules issued by hud raised such serious issues about fair grievance procedures and the inequity of families including the elderly losing housing assistance because a family member is accusedmind you not even convictedof criminal activities far from their home that the chairman of the select committee on aging and others requested that hearings be held early next year those hearings will take place we expect hud meanwhile will review the regulations during the interim rule comment period to address the concerns expressed in the conference report second the conference report language indicating that section 262 and the other preservation provisions of the housing and community development act of 1987 were not intended to prevent hud from extending section 8 contracts for terms less than 5 years and directed hud to permit shorter than 5year extensions applies to all types of section 8 contracts including those which were originally entei d into on newly constructed and substantially rehabilitated projects and without regard to the source of the projects mortgage financing third with regard to the provision requiring hud to restore section 8 rents that were reduced between april 15 1987 and february 5 1988 and to reimburse owners for lost payments the conferees had to subject this requirement to approval in an appropriations act for fiscal year 1989 in order to avoid a point of order that could otherwise be made in the other body however on october 1 1989 owners would have a right to such restoration and payments it has come to the attention of the conferees that some meritworthy applicants for grants under the supportive housing demon stration program have been denied for technical reasons relating to certification of their status as nonprofit entities under section 501 c 3 of the internal revenue code some of those applicants will find the resources they need to fund projects that will help people through the cold winter months ahead but a technical reading of the conference report may lead officials at hud to deny funding in the next round of grant applications because these projects will no longer be in the startup stage one vry strong applicant from cambridge ma was denied funding as a result of a misunderst nding regarding non profit status atid it may lose its eligibility for the next round of applications if it proceeds with temporary funding from other sources the conferees would expect that any grant applicant refused for technical reasons on this years round of applications would not be precluded from receiving a grant in the next round nor should such an applicant be precluded from receiving approval if additional funds become available in the interim period before the next formal round of applications these grants are not intended to supplant state and local funding for ongoing services but the conferees feel strongly that a meritworthy applicant should not be denied eligibility for this type of grant simply because the applicant is able to find temporary funding to begin serving the needs of homeless people this winter finally during the course of the conference the issue of clarifying the department of housing and urban developments authority over mortgagebacked securities issued by the federal national mortgage association was discussed subsequently the department decided to grant permanent authority to fnma to issue real estate mortgage investment conduits while the conferees concur in that decision we wish to point out that fnmas competitors fhlmc is still subject to limited remic authority by its board of directors the federal home loan bank board we want to make clear that it is imperative that competitive parity be maintained between fnma and fhlmc and that we would expect no restrictions would be placed on the operations of fhlmc that would in any way limit the positive competitive role that exists between fnma and fhlmc as procedures of affordable mortgage credit to american homebuyers i urge the adoption of this

administration is promoting a futile destabilizing unrealistic and unworkable star wars program it should be halted although there have been some technological advances in recent years star wars is futile because we still do not know how to build an effective nationwide strategic defense against attacking ballistic missiles this is true whether the goal is to transcend deterrence with a nearly leakproof defense or to enhance it with an effective but partial defense we cannot build an effective defense against the current soviet threat and regardless of what the proponents of star wars have to say there is no prospect of achieving such a defense against an unlimited offensive threat that can overwhelm evade or directly attack a star wars defense several years ago the presidents commission on strategic forces reported that at this time no abm technologies appear to combine practicality survivability low cost and technical effectiveness sufficiently to justify proceeding beyond the stage of technology development this statement still holds true today a staff report submitted to senators proxmire and johnston in april 1987 stated that the nearterm deployment that the strategic defense initiative office has in mind for the 199495 timeframe would have an effectiveness against soviet ballistic missile warheads of no more than 16 percent in short many years if not decades of research are required before we can begin to proceed from present day imaginative concepts crude ideas and estimates of educated guesses in fact with an unconstrained development of ballistic missiles no defensive system will work if the star wars program is to meet the presidents stated goal of rendering nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete not only must it work to almost 100 percent perfection managing an enormous task of battle management in very short time but it must do this the very first time that it is used no realistic shakedown tests are conceivable especially in the nuclear environment the system will encounter in a real engagement along with president reagan secretary of defense weinberger holds to the fantasy that a 100 percent effective defensive shield is feasible one that is according to weinberger thoroughly reliable and total secretary weinberger however should listen to gen james abrahamson who is in charge of the strategic defense initiative when he said that a perfect defense is not a realistic thing there is no way that any enemy force will not be able to overwhelm a defense if it wants to do so badly enough the soviets can develop countermeasures to overcome a star wars deployment even if only 5 percent of the strategic warheads in the soviets nuclear arsenal successfully penetrated a star wars system the united states would be destroyed we should question whether the supporters of sdi understand that the star wars program will result in the united states building a maginot line in space that the soviets could overwhelm star wars is highly destabilizing because any prospect of a significantly improved american defense is absolutely certain to stimulate the most energetic soviet efforts to ensure the continued ability of soviet warheads to get through a defensive system it is fanciful to believe that the prospect of any united states deployment of an antiballistic missile system which would undermine the effectiveness of soviet missile forces will not be met by a most determined and sustained response by moscow the soviets have already stated that in the event of a star wars deployment they will concentrate on building cheaper offensive nuclear missiles that could overwhelm an american space shield this in turn will spur american efforts to counter any countermeasures undertaken by the soviets the department of defense is in the process of devising a nuclear war plan and command structure that would integrate offensive nuclear forces with the projected star wars antimissile shield reports on this dod plan state that the vast array of new nuclear weapons including the b1 bomber trident submarines armed with ballistic missiles the pershing ii medium range ballistic missile and the cruise missile along with other weapons still being developed will be coordinated with the shield of weapons on landand in space that star wars proposes with the aim of destroying longrange soviet missiles and their warheads before they strike the united states such plans serve of course to further increase the fear by the soviet union of the purpose of star wars especially against a weakened retaliatory strike in a crisis these fears could bring mounting pressures for launching a first strike against our nation it should be obvious that to the soviets star wars integrated with offensive nuclear forces is going to look like the prelude to an offensive strategy threatening the soviet deterrent star wars will not promote a more peaceful stable world on the contrary star wars promises to accelerate the arms competition between the united states and the soviet union it threatens the very existence of the 1972 abm treaty which outlaws any star wars defense and which stands at the very center of the effort to limit the strategic arms race by international agreements the scowcroft commission found that the strategic implications of the ballistic missile defense and the criticality of the abm treaty to further arms control agreements dictate extreme caution in proceeding to engineering development in this sensitive area the abm treaty is a safeguard less against defense as such than against unbridled competition between the two nuclear superpowers the continuing and excessive competition that still exists in offensive weapons would have been even worse without the abm treaty which removed from the calculations of both sides any fear of an early and destabilizing defensive deployment since 1972 and before the coming of star wars neither side has attempted a defensive deployment that predictably would have given much more fear to the adversary than comfort to the possessor the abm treaty reflected a common understanding of exactly the kinds of danger with which star wars now confronts the world to lose this treaty in pursuit of an antiballistic missile defense dream would be a foolish act the best course of action we can follow is to terminate this pork barrel in the sky star wars program the american people are being misled by those who state that star wars is intended to provide for nottiing less than the physical protection of the united states including its population and industry it is more realistic to state that star wars is dedicated to defending our landbased ballistic missiles let us end this charade by voting for the dellumsboxer amendment we should not be accelerating the arms race by seeking security through means which creates greater insecurities instead let us get on with the business of ending the threat of a nuclear

graciousness in yielding to my special order this special order today that i have called pertains to the japanese noncompliance with market access provisions of the united l atesjapan semiconductor agreement and i called this special order at this time to bring this matter to the attention of my colleagues just before the president begins to engage in the economic summit meetings that he will be having next week i come to the house floor raising this issue from a background of generally opposing what had been labeled protectionist amendments and provisions of legislation that have come before this body in the three terms in which i have set red here in the house members who are familiar with my own voting record and my own attitudes and views with regard to issues that have been i think oversimplified in terms of being labeled between free trade and protectionism will see that my votes fall very much on the socalled free trade side of that spectrum and i have consistently resisted and opposed a variety of efforts to move toward a much more restrictive and protectionist trade regime it is with that background in mind that i felt that it was extremely important and timely to raise to the membership and those who might be interested some of the background and history that has led to the exasperation that a number of us feel with regard to the japanese performance within the provisions of the united statesjapan semiconductor agreement one of the most important economic issues facing our nation today i think we all agree is the trade deficit with japan alone our deficit was in excess of 60 billion in 1987 a central part of the solution to that trade deficit problem between our country and japan must be increased penetration of the japanese market for manufactured american goods the united statesjapan semiconductor agreement which is now nearly 2 years old offers the romise of achieving a significant inurease in united states semiconductor exports to japan to enforce a solemn international agreement to review the competitive disadvantage of american industry and to reduce our bilateral trade deficit with japan the united states i believe must remain firm and resolute in its resolve to achieve access to the japanese market let me review a little bit of the history leading up to this agreement which will help to underscore the frustration that many of us feel with regard to what has recently transpired within its context since the 1960s the united states semiconductor industry has been limited to about a 10percent market share in japan in the beginning unitedstates sales were excluded through quotas high tariffs and nvestment restriction as these barriers were gradually removed under united states pressure they were replaced not by the same type of overt clear barriers such as those that i just mentioned but by less transparent but nevertheless effective barriers to penetration of the japanese market in 1983 after 2 years of negotiations the united states thought that it had obtained full market access with the signing of the united statesjapan semiconductor recommendations yet still there was no improvement in united states access to the japanese market finally 2 years later in 1985 the semiconductor industry association filed a formal section 301 trade case against japan for the denial of market access this trade case was later suspended in july 1986 with the initialing of the united statesjapan semiconductor agreement in that semiconductor agreement the japanese government committed to providing a gradual and steady increase in foreign participation in the japanese semiconductor market those were the explicit terms of the agreement and i quote and underscore gradual and steady gradual and steady increase the government of japan also recognized under that agreement the united states industry expectation that foreign share of the japanese semiconductor market would rise to over 20 percent by the year 1991 as a result of the agreement the semiconductor agreement was formally signed by japanese ambassador matsunaga and united states trade representative yeutter on september 2 1986 once again the japanese acted as if the conclusion of the semiconductor agreement then became the end of the matter foreign share of the japanese market did not increase at all despite the agreements that were entered into on september 2 1986 but this time there was a difference the united states government with the full bipartisan support of the united states congress decided finally to take action to obtain compensation for violation of its agreement with japan it was an appropriate action and it was action that was taken only after a great deal of patience and a great deal of history on apri 17 1087 sanctions appropriately were imposed on japan in the form of an additional 100percent tariff on 300 million of imports from japan and 165 million of these sanctions were for violation of the market access portions of the agreement let me again emphasize as i did at the beginning of my remarks a number of us who supported these sanctions have historically and traditionally resisted any type of legislative action to force these types of compliance but after decades of exasperati n fri tration and downright resistance the congress concluded that they had no option on april 17 1987 other than to impose these sanctions consideration and implementation of the sanctions did produce a temporary improvement in the united states share of the japanese semiconductor market but the improvement proved to be short lived the unitedstates market share stabilized at about 10 percent and by the first quarter of this year had actually declined to 9 7 percent now let me mention that without access to the japanese market other initiatives to promote competitiveness of the united states semiconductor industry will essentially be undermined and undercut semitech for instance who intended to restore united states leadership in semiconductor manufacturing technology wihtout full access to the japanese semiconductor market the worlds largest semiconductor market united states companies will not be able to obtain the same manufacturing scale as their japanese competitors which would effectively reduce the effectiveness of the semitech program furthermore to position themselves to take advantage of the semiconductor agreement the american companies have made extraordinary efforts in the japanese market they have not simply assumed that the japanese market should be available without taking the kind of steps and the kind of strides that would be expected of them to be taken and these efforts include for example expending 1 9 billion in 1987 alone and 2 7 billion thus far in 1938 in captal expenditures to increase production capacity operating 18 design centers 27 test and quality assurance centers and 46 sales offices throughout japan and substantially increasing soles and technical support personnel in japan the rapidly increasing list of quality awards and preferred vendor awards given to american companies by their japanese customers also provldes evidence that american companies are very competitive in the japanese market if they are simply allowed to be unitedstates companies ha won some 33 of these awards and they have won 13 of them since the semiconductor agreement was signed yet we see that market shares does not increase governmenttogovernment and industrytoindustry talks have not led to any improvemtlt in the situation in fact industrytoindusry talks in tokyo broke down earlier this monti when the japanese side refused to recognize that the objective of the tnlk s was to increase foreign participation in the japanese market the japanese side refused to ratify language that include a statement that demonstrated that the two sides were working on a agreement leading to increase foreign market share n japan the essence of the objective and even that language was proposed by the american side to be modified by saying that the japanese side considers that this can be realized and would welcome this realization and shares this expectation and then modifying language that says the attainment of such an expectation depends upon competitive factors including the sales efforts of foreign semiconductor producers and the purchasing efforts of semiconductor users in japan even with that modification simple expectation language that this agreement would lead to increased foreign market share in japan caused the breakdown of talks 2 years after an agreement has in fact been executed my colleague the gentleman from washington and i have recently circulated a letter to a number of our colleagues in the house that we will be sending to president reagan tomorrow as he embarks upon the economic summit in toronto next week in the context of this letter mr miller and i are bringing to the attention of a number of our colleagues this specific situation and urging cie president to hang tough on these negotiations and on this issue in his economic summit in toronto when he meets with prime minister takeshita it is unbelievable at this point that there could be any doubt whatsoever about the objective of market access efforts it is were not fully clear to japan in 1970 18 years ago what the point of the united states semiconductor market access effort was it should have been clear by the 1983 semiconductor recommendations 5 years ago and it certainly should have been crystal clear in the context of the sia trade case and the semiconductor agreement of 2 years ago now there are rumors that at the economic summit prime minister takeshita may ask president reagan to remove the market access sanctions against japan as if the sanctions were the issue no mr prime minister the sanctions are not the issue here the issue is japanese compliance with an agreement between japan and the united states that is the issue that should be very clear that is the issue president regan put it very well at the time he imposed the sanctions when he said we will eliminate these as soon as we have firm and continuing evidence that the dumping in third world country markets has stopped and access to the japanese market has improved thus far there is no firm or continuing evidence that access to the japanese market has improved and unfortunately the evidence not only i114413 points in the opposite direction the situation is getting worse and that specific language caused the breakdown of the talks just last month so i am here to urge that the president make clear to prime minister takeshita that the burden of removing the market access sanctions rests firmly on japan i also urge the president to request an explanation of continued japanese noncompliance with the semiconductor agreement we must succeed in obtaining access to the japanese market and the semiconductor situation offers an excellent test case this should be the highest priority trade issue for our government and it should be a major subject of discussion at the economic summit i see my colleague from the state of washington here on the floor and i would be delighted to yield to mr miller who has coauthored with me the letter that i recently referreu to that we will be circulating and sending

to suggest one correction to the gentlemans comment and that is this is not a new idea with the reagan administration in one way or another in each budget submitted since 1981 when coincidentally reagan became president and i became chairman of post office and civil service he turned it into a very busy committee because there has been a constant and very direct attack in every possible way that you might attack the federal work force federal employees and the post office as well in their budgets that have come to us each year there has been one suggestion after another that somehow the post office would work much better if you did something magic called privatizing it as a matter of fact the first budget that the president sent to us had thisand i am paraphrasingrather strange approach it said that in an age when everybody is connected to an efficient telephone system there is no reason why the government should subsidize a highcost package delivery system now anyone who read that knew automatically that the person who wrote it did not know what they were talking about first if anyone believes that they have an efficient telephone system in their part of the country i would like to meet them because they are a lot luckier than the folks i represent in michigan the breakup of the telephone companies has not produced either cheap or efficient telephone service it has in fact increased the cost and decreased the efficiency but more importantly with respect to the post office we are not the biggest parcel delivery service anymore the united parcel service delivers far more volume than the unitedstates postal service does but the difference is if you are living on a farm and you order your baby chicks through a mail order catalog our rural letter carrier will bring them to you the private companies would not do that they are not interested in coming out to the farmer and i have no doubt that in my urban area very close to the city of detroit where my 530 000 constituents are compacted in a very accessible place with good roads and even in the wintertime plenty of facilities to keep them open that somebody could buy that little piece of the postal service and make a profit delivering the mail and i have no doubt that the post office makes a profit in my district but it has to make a profit in my district so that it can absorb the cost of providing 6day service to any amerlcan in the remotest part of our country and we have made that promise since before the constitution the postal service predates the constitution it is of some historical interest to students of the post office to note that if you read the constitution like a book and start from the front and assume that they put the most important things up close to the front you will find interestingly that the framers of the constitution provided that the congress could provide for a postal service before they ever got further on down in the constitution to talking about providing for an army so they thought first of the importance to this country of having a universal mail delivery communication system and then they later thought well maybe we ought to have an army also in case something happens and we all know that it did a few years later when the british came back in the war of 1812 but it is important to note that the congress has a constitutional responsibility to maintain a postal service for the american people and to fulfill that constitutional responsibility we have to look at the relative merits of what the reagan people are proposing we permit and indeed have a great deal of contracting out in the federal government we contract for food services on military bases now we contract for guard services at all kinds of federal installations we contract for janitorial services we contract for all kinds of services those contracts went out over the years on this basis if it was found that it was cheaper for the taxpayers to have a private contractor perform a particular function for tie government and the contracting officer could certify that it would save the government money by doing that and still provide the public service they could go ahead and contract the reagan people operate with an entirely different set of ethics and a different approach their approach is if we have got a friend who can make a buck by taking over a piece of the governments action let us take care of our friends who want to make a buck and the hell with the public service and who cares what the taxpayers think about it and whether the people on the rural routes get taken care of if we have some friends who can make a few bucks let them make a few bucksbut i can tell you this right now the united parcel service is the biggest and most successful competitor we have and we live side by side with it we have no trouble with it it delivers all over the country except it does not deliver in alaska because even with the tremendous expertise that it has developed over the years and the tremendous resources it has as the largest company of its kind even bigger than we are now in the parcel business it cannot deliver in alaska at a breakeven or a profitmaking rate and so it does not try to deliver in alaska we deliver parcel post in alaska and we deliver to people all over alaska if you are an elderly woman living alone on the end of a 5mile deadend road in montana 6 days a week our letter carrier comes by and looks to see if your little red flag is up on the box he does not just come out there when he has got something to deliver ihe comes every day to see it you might have something that you want to send as well as to bring you whatever it is that he has to deliver to you indeed i find it one of the marvels that the wall street journal from time to time speaks with some affection about this idea of privatization they depend on the post office very much but i like to remind them when i talk to them and their lobbyists that if this little elderly woman in montana chooses to get the daily wall street journal she can receive at the end of that rural route todays wall street journal before noontodays the same one you buy here in washington or you buy in new york city it is printed in different places around the country simultaneously during the night but our rural letter carrier will bring her the wall street journal that may not be an important linchpin on which to hang the whole argument about preserving her rights but that is a right and a privilege that she as an american citizen has enjoyed along with her ancestors for 200 years these people want to turn it on its head one more thing i would like to say you frequently hear spokesmen for the reagan administration speaking admiringly of margaret thatchers efforts to privatize the governments functions in great britain the gentleman from missouri and i have taken the time to go over and meet with margaret thatchers privatizers and they were quite shocked as a matter of fact when we talked to them about what the reagan people had in mind for our post office they say that it is patently ridiculous they are engaged in doing some privatizing in the british post office and this i find almost humorous what they are calling privatizing is this they are actually going out to little corner general stores in little villages and saying how would you like to have a contract to sell stamps and take in packages and so on and well have somebody come by once a day and pick it up now every american has seen this all over our country since the beginning of our country we have had little country stores where you can buy your stamps and it did all the things that a city post office did they are called contract stations we have thousands of those as a matter of tradition the british are now going to experiment with a couple thousand of those for the first time and they are calling that privatization so anybody who tries to say we are following the great example of margaret thatcher is wrong they do not know what they are talking about what is it that margaret thatcher really wants to privatize she has already privatized the largest trucking company in great britain never in this country did our federal government ever get into the truck transportation business in competition with private enterprise we have never been in it the british motor system was a governmentowned and operated trucking company and if you wanted to go into the business of hauling furniture from town to town or hauling merchandise from town to town you had to compete with the government she has now sold that off to private enterprise we say bully for her we never were in that business in the first place she is not interested in selling british railways by the way or british air we do not run governmentowned railroads and we do not run governmentowned commercial airlines so the comparisons that they make with the british are altogether inappropriate we have seen most recently attempts by the administration actually through the instrument of the director of office of management and budget during the last budget reconciliation exercise to literally use the budget process to cripple the post office and to reduce the efficiency of the post office and it will have that effect i am sorry to say that we could not stop it we mitigated it but we could not stop it the postal service will not be as efficient during the next 2 years as it would if we had left them alone now during the nixon administration surprisingly again there does not seem to be any consistency with this administration they came to town and said they were republican well nixon was a republican too the republicans were very proud of the fact that during the nixon administration we created a separate corporation to run the postal service with a board of directors appointed by the president of the united states i might say for california that currently that board of directors is very heavily weighted with california citizens but it is a good board and they are doing a good job they pick the postmaster general he is no longer a political appointee nobody in congress can decide who the postmaster general is going to be and the president cannot do it it is that board le incidentally the new one has just come from being one of the most successful bankers in the gentlemans state to being the postmaster general now in the budget reconciliation process they arbitrarily in order to phony the books and make the deficit look better forced us into telling the post office that they had to stop construction of new buildings they had to stop purchasing electronic mail sorting equipment they had to slow down the purchase of new vehicles just slow everything down now costs of capital projects will be higher next year than this year we know that it was not done for any sound business purpose privatizers such as the omb director have one pure and simple motivationto cripple the postal service he denies this he has been before my committee and i have made this accusation to him on the record and he has denied on the record that that is his true motive but my belief my own prejudice is that what he was trying to do in this one last gasp before this administration leaves town is to so discourage the american people about whether or not the postal service was efficient effective and was serving them that they would start to listen sympathetically to these phonybaloney kind of arguments that will make a fast buck for a few big shots in this country for a short time and leave american communications in shambles there is nothing that americans have the right to and take for granted as regularly as their mail service it is still is it not worth a newspaper story if a letter gets delivered late or if a letter gets lost last year the unitedstates postal service delivered 154 billion pieces of mail from one american to another and from people overseas to americans 154 billion when we created the corporation for mr nixon the post office was then delivering around 70 billion less than half as much as now that tremendous growth has occurred and we have about the same number of employees working for the post office today delivering 154 billion pieces as we had when we were delivering 70 billion i submit that if i owned stock in an automobile company that was increasing its productivity at anythng close to the rate of the increased productivity in the post office i would retire happily from here write my memoirs and clip my coupons because i would be rich forevermore no matter how small an investment there are few private companies during the 18year life of the unitedstates postal corporation that have shown a consistent yearbyyear increase in productivity that comes any place close to that of the postal service reagan used to like to say if it aint broke dont fix it i hope that somebody can get close enough to him maybe we could send a message to nancy ronnie if it aint broke dont try to fix it the unitedstates postal service is and always has been a universal service available to every american regardless of class or location in this country and everybody pays the same price now when you pick up the telephone to call a relative across the country you pay a penalty because that relative and you are separated by a long distance but if you put a firstclass letter in the mail it does not matter if your relative is on the other side of town or the other side of the country for the same price we will get it there for you the dedicated people who work for the post office i have served in the unitedstates navy i have served in the unitedstates air force and i have had the pleasure of serving here for 24 years i have never met better people more dedicated to the mission that they are embarked on and proud of their service than the federal postal employees and that goes for the rural letter carrier the city letter carrier the mail handler the clerk the postmaster the managers every one of them they have an esprit de corps that is as good or better than anything you will find in any of our elite military operations at any time even in war time i am very proud of them and very proud to be the chairman of the committee that has the responsibility for watching to make sure that they are always doing their job occasionally we do criticize and occasionally we find a reason to criticize unfortunately we had a former campaign official for mr reagan from the state of ohio in jail a couple of years ago because he was involved in a fraud against the post office which has cost us a lot of money one final thing what would we save the taxpayers if we prlvatized it all the subsidies we are paying them year 1982 is the last year that the gentleman from california and i voted to spend one nickel to subsidize the operation of the post office the unitedstates postal service pays its own way by selling service to customers the people who buy stamps to put on letters or packages are the people who pay for the post office not the person who pays income tax there is not a pennys worth of your income tax or my income tax going over there to subsidize that operation it is a business that carries its own weight that is why they recently had to raise the rates and why again 3 years from now there probably will be an increase in rates just as 3 years from now when you go into the store the items you are buying now will be a little bit more expensive than they are today but we do not use taxpayers money to subsidize that post office we use taxpayers money to subsidize charitable organizations so that they can mail cheaper and others but we do not subsidize the employees of that operation they do it on their own and they do it proudly and they do it well and i think it is a great disservice to this country for the reagan people to continue running around trying to fool somebody into thinking that they could get a btrgain a better bargain i ask people to compare the price of a firstclass stamp here with anyplace else do most of the people in california think that canadians are pretty much like us and that things in canada are usually pretty much like they are here it costs almost 28 cents in canada for what we pay 25 cents for here so i would ask people to look very very closely at these get rich schemes that are being proposed we know from the newspapers what kind of people are lurking out there in the wings ready to make a fast buck if we do not watch them closely i promise that i will stick with the gentleman from california as i have in the past i have always been proud to follow the gentlemans leadership nobody in this house has demonstrated more devotion to protecting the rights of federal employees as citizens because they are citizens even though they work for the government i have followed the leadership of the gentleman from california for 24 years i intend to keep doing it as long as we have the privilege of being here and those jaspers as congressman john dingell says are not going to get our postal pelts hanging on their barn doors privatization is a concept that is very near and dear to the reagan administrations heart this administration has consistently advocated that the federal government should be run more like a business after all they say competition always results in lower prices fur the consumer when it comes to the postal service the reagan administrations blind faith in the virtues of free market competition is misplaced the administration ignores the fact that while privatization might result in lower rates for some urban postal customers it would cer tainly destroy the overall efficiency of the postal system we currently enjoy the universal service our citizens know and expect the cornerstone of our postal system the postal monopoly predates the constitution in our nations history congressional actions over the years have supported the postal monopoly as the best way of preserving efficient communications throughout our land the postal reorganization act of 1970 reiterated the need for postal monopoly so that the postal service could continue to provide prompt reliable and efficient service to all areas of the country the postal monopoly is necessary to bind the nation together the idea of privatizing the mail system is not a now one in the 1800s private express companies were allowed to move the mall predictably only the profitable urban routes were taken over leaving the expensive rural routes to be served by the post office and when many of the private companies failed the effects on the quality and cost of mail dolivery were disastrous the advocates of privatization believe that competition alone will ensure lower costs and quality service they completely overlook the fact that a crucial ingredient of quality postal service is public accountability the only accountability that private express carriers have is to the bottom line privatization of the postal service would moan the end of statutory protections for letter mail would failing private express companies feel obligated to ensure the integrity and deliverability of letters in their custody or once the money ran out would they stop delivery of the mail those who advocate the privatization of the mail system fall to heed the advice of an old saying if it aint broke dont fix it sure complaining about the postal service is a popular thing to do much like complaining about the weather and certainly any operation as large as the unitedstates postal service is going to make occasional mistakes however the reality is that the united states has the most efficient mall delivery system in the world for 25 cents americans can mail a letter anywhere in the united states and be assured that it will reach its destination in a timely manner at 25 cents the firstclass stamp is still a bargain prlvatization of the mall system would bring an abrupt end to the convenience the american postal customer currently enjoys and depends on as private express companies compete for the lucrative urban routes the postal service will be required to chargo exorbitant rates to serve the rural areas rural americans would be forced to pay higher postage rates than urban americans this is blatantly unfair thus privatization would result in the death of universal postal service and the end of affordable universal postal rates which all americans have come to expect and which they deserve the united states already has in place a committed work force and a system of specialized machinery and vehicles which provide americans with the most efficient delivery system in the world there is absolutely no reason for the reagan administration to destroy a system that already serves the american people so well"],

where we have the largest number of welfare recipients there are no day care provisions there are no places for children to be taken care of we are going to take away protections that have been provided to children for 50 years and more we are going to take it away if h r 1720 were to be enacted i would be willing to accept some positive features and take my chances on the negatives if i thought this bill would be the bill we come out with after it goes to a conservative senate and after a hostile administration in the white house finishes bargaining over it we are going to make matters far worse it would be far better to wait for a more objective atmosphere a less hostile administration and we can then have real welfare reform to protect young children who are poor the sponsors of the family welfare reform act are absolutely right our present education and training system for afdc recipients is an unmitigated disaster which badly needs reform but to the extent that the current debate about reform has suggested that the system has failed because there previously has been some great mystery about the best means to help afdc recipients achieve selfsufficiency it has been intellectually dishonest we do know what kind of programs work and we have known it for a long timewe just have not used that knowledge because it has not been politically expedient to do so rather than challenging the ugly mythology which exists in this country about who poor people are and why they are poor we have permitted it to drive state and federal welfare policies afdc benefits have been kept at indecently low levels in nearly every state and education and training programs that we know would be effective in helping people to escape the poverty trap have not been put in place because they either cost too much money or lack the punitive edge the stereotypes demand and not surprisingly our policies have failed starved of resources and constructed around falsehoods they have only succeeded in making the miserable more miserable unfortunately few of the selfdescribed welfare reform initiatives that have been floated over the last several years have departed from the destructive stereotypical thinking of the past indeed most would exacerbate the current problems rather than help correct them in several critical ways however the family welfare reform act does manage to break free from our past mistakes it deemphasizes but regrettably does not reject the inadequate and often purely punitive work and training programs that are now in wide use and requires that states provide education and training programs which we know from years of research and experience to be effective it also does not assume that all afdc recipients are essentially the same and rejects the ineffective onesizefitsall training strategy popular in many states requiring instead that a diversity of training opportunities appropriate for a variety of needs and interests be made available in each state and it recognizes that meiningful training programs cannot be done on the cheap and provides the substantial resources which are needed to make these programs work most significantly h r 1720 recognizes as previous efforts have not that an inadequate education is the principal obstacle to selfsufficiency for most afdc recipients the current lack of attention to this critical need is inexcusable in new york city today an estimated 70 percent of afdc recipients read at or below the eighthgrade level and fully a third read below the fifthgrade level but only a fraction of those recipients who want to enroll in an educational program are currently able to do so since nearly all job training programs available through win and jtpa require that participants have at least an eighthgrade education this failure to provide adequate educational opportunities has effectvely shut those with educational needs out of the best and most successful training programs forcing them instead into dickensian workfare assignments which do not even pretend to address their needs perversely recipients who are relatively well educated and need the least assistance in obtaining employment get athe most attention and help recipients with the greatest needs get nothing h r 1720 promises to help remedy the current lack of availability of educational programs for afdc recipients by requiring that each state provide a full range of educational services including basic skills and englishasasecondlanguage instruction and high school and high school equivalency education to every recipient who needs them an amendment i offered in the education and labor committee additionally requires that educational services be offered first before any otner activity or program to all who need them further ensuring that states give full and immediate priority to addressing this critical problem as a result of an amendment offered by chairman hawkins in the education and labor committee h r 1720also provides the strong federal mandate which is needed to ensure that adequate postsecondary educational opportunities are made available to afdc recipients current law gives states complete discretion to decide whether or not and under what conditions recipients may enroll at a postsecondary educational institution and most states useor rather abusethat discretion to sharply limit access to higher education either prohibiting it altogether or limiting access to shortterm vocational training courses only afdc recipients with the drive and ability to do well in college are thus now finding themselves funneled into cosmetology school and other less challenging matchbook training programs instead it is a tragic and foolhardy waste of human talent h r 1720 would remove these inequitable and arbitrary limits on the aspirations of afdc recipients access to higher education would be assured for all qualified persons funded either by the federal and state student aid system or if the state wished by network training moneys and could take the form of vocational training a 2year community college or a 4year baccalaureate program decisions concerning an individuals enrollment in a postsecondary program would be based upon that persons interests and actual abilities not on preconceived notions about what is appropriate for afdc recipients or their capabilities h r 1720 also breaks from the demeaning bigbrotherknowsbest mentality which typifies many afdc training programs and gives each participant the opportunity to select the education and training programs he or she wants to pursue amendments made by the education and labor committee assure that this emphasis on individual choice is taken seriously by the states and is not sabotaged by rushed and incomplete orientations and skills assessments during the intake process this is particularly important for new york city because of the outrageously inadequate job the city now does in informing clients of their rights and options and ensuring that training assignments are tailored to individual needs and interests while many states now spend several hours on the orientation and assessment of work programs participants new york incredibly spends an average of less than 15 minutes on these activities for each participant in its mandatory work programsless time than it takes for many fast food restaurants to fry a burger the most basic information about the program goes unexplained participants are frequently never informed of their right to child care and are in any event nevergiven any help in finding such care testing of academic skills is only rarely performed and few if any clients are given any say atall about the training program to which they are assigned people consider themselves lucky in fact if they are able to figure out what their assignment is before they are hurried out the door h r 1720 prohibits the slipshod approach to intake now in use in new york and requires that the orientation and assessment processes be given the time they obviously require to be effective and meaningful the opportunities rights and requirements of the network program must be explained in detail both orally and in writing the states obligation to provide child care to participants must be explicitly stated and assistance must be provided in locating that care whenever it is needed assessements of skills and needs must be thorough and individualized and must in each case include testing of reading skills so that no educational needs go overlooked finally as a result of an amendment 1 offered in committee each participant is given up to 10 working days to review the training options he or she selects during intake and to make any changes in those initial choices that he or she wants to make this provision was recommended by statewide youth advocacy of new york and should help ensure that the decisions made by network participants are fully informed and truly reflects the needs and goals of each individual h r 1720 not only requires states to offer education and training programs of demonstrated effectiveness to afdc recipients it also imposed longoverdue restrictions on a program which the research tells us is practically worthless in preparing afdc recipients for the workforce the community work experience program cwep or workfare in many cases cwep assignments are demeaning makework jobs such as handling out flyers on streetcomers filling soap dispensers and wandering around parking lots watching cars which are more effective at humiliating people than building the skills they need to find a real job in other cases state and local governments have used cwep to both displace and undercut the wages of their employees by forcing workfare participants to perform jobs usually performed by civil servants and for which they should rightfully be paid a regular salary such as in new york citys now exclusive use of workfare participants to perform the civil service position of pest control aide and its apparent use of workfare enrollees to displace civil service custodians through attrition perhaps the best example of the fundamental unfairness of workfare is the case of one michigan man who lost his 13 000 a year job as a city dogcatcher due to budget cuts got his job back again under ceta for 9 000 a year and then after ceta was eliminated was ordered to do the same job again cwep for a 6 000 annual welfare grant this man is performing the same work he has always had only now he is receiving less than half the pay although h r 1720 does not as it should eliminate this 20th century form of serfdom and prohibit workfare altogether it does at lease reform cwep to prevent some of the worst abuses of the program workfare assignments may no longer be openended and are limited to a maximumn of 3 months for 30 hours per week or a maximum of 6 months if the number of hours or work per month is based upon the size of the individuals afdc grant deadend makework jobs are prohibited each cwep assignment must develop marketable job skills or be integrated with a regular training program which imparts such skills finally the week current law protections against the displacement of employees th rough the use of participants in cwep and work supplementation programs are significantly strengthened and are generally made to conform with the labor standards which now govern work experience and onthejob training programs provided under the job training partnership act while these are important pathbreaking improvements hr 1720 also includes other provisions which are just plain destructive in particular i am very concerned about the legislations elimination of the current law exemption for parents of children between the ages of 3 and 5and down to age 1 at the states optionfrom the requirement that they participate in a work or training program in order to receive afdc benefits this dramatic change in the law has serious implications which unfortunately have been largely glossed over by h r 1720s proponents expanding the mandatory participation requirement is distressing first and foremost because it is unnecessary and is based on the selfserving lie that the unemployed do not want to work and will not work unless we force then to do so no one who has ever spent any time in an economically depressed community can make such a claim the desperation the anguished pleas for jobs and job training are obvious and everywhere after having fought for years with other members to try to address these needs with meaningful fullemployment legislation only to be continually turned back by complacency and indifference i cannot help but be astonished by all of the sudden pompous accusations that the poor of all people have breached some social contract and must be compelled to make amends suddenly poverty and unemployment no longer have anything to do with badly conceived economic policies and backward budgetary priorities its not our fault its theirs poor people the twisted message seems to be have brought their misery on themselves through their own laziness immorality and bad habits and getting them off welfare can only be accomplished through some crude kind of behavior modification forcing them to do this and that and chasing them like so many lab rats through a bureaucratic maze with a panoply of carrots and sticks it is a dishonest ruse which demeans and insults poor people but this is hardly the worst of it what makes a broader mandatory participation requirement most objectionable is that it will hurt precisely those who the afdc program is intended to help and protect young children although h r 1720 ostensibly guarantees child care for children under age 6 to those parents who are compelled to participate in a work or training program it establishes only nominal standards for the quality of that care and limits funding for it to no more than 175 per month for children ages 2 and over and 200 per month for infants for cities like new york where child care is in drastically short supply and the monthly cost of care far exceeds the limits established in h r 1720 this sort of guarantee is about as meaningful as an all you can eat sign on mother hubbards cupboard inevitably the enactment of this legislation will mean that at least some mothers and perhaps most in some communities will be forced to leave their children and infants in substandard child care arrangements such a result would be distressing in any event but that it would ensue from legislation which purports to be profamily welfare reform is particularly disturbing the mandatory participation requirement will also hurt children by reducing benefits to many families who desperately need them to survive for political reasons we have concocted the orwellian fiction that sanctions really do not affect children because the afdc grant is not terminated outright but is merely reduced by the amount that is supposed to go toward the needs of the parent the reality however is that if you reduce assistance to a household you cannot help but hurt everyone it includes it is not likely for example that a sanctioned parent will cease to eat for the duration of the sanctions nor is it likely that a landlord will evict only the sanctioned parent when the rent comes up short inevitably children will suffer to make matters worse in most cases sanctions will be imposed for no good reason in theory at least sanctions are supposed to punish only the lazy and most recalcitrant the recipients who absolutely refuse to participate but in the real world they are far less precise and operate more like a grotesque lottery of pain we know from experience that every time you demand that afdc recipients fill out one more new form or fulfill one more administrative requirement in order to retain their benefits you increase the likelihood that more and more people will lose benefits simply because they cannot keep up with the paperwork or cannot jump high or fast enough to make it through all of the bureaucratic hoops we put in their way mandatory work requirements have proven to be the most effective at producing this kind of churning of the afdc rolls because they create so many more hoops through which recipients are expected to continuously leap and frequently involve the making of arbitrary judgments by harried caseworkers about what is and is not a goodcause reason for missing a compulsory training class or workfare assignment our experience in new york city is a good example of just how devastating an effect compulsory participation requirements can have since 1985 fully 30 percent of the persons required to participate in our workfare program8 000 afdc recipientshave been sanctioned most of these sanctions were imposed not because recipients were lazy or uncooperative but because of mixups and misunderstandings after putting families through weeks and sometimes months of financial hardship a consistent 98 percent of the sanctions have been found to be unjustified and thrown out in fair hearings by expanding the coverage of the mandatory participation requirement to include most persons now receiving afdc benefits h r 1720 guarantees that many more thousands of families nationwide will be subjected to this kind of random bureaucratic terrorism if h r 1720 were to be enacted into law as it is currently drafted it might be persuasively argued that these and other destructive elements in the bill are acceptable tradeoffs for the significant improvements over current law which are also contained in the legislation the problem is that there is no reason to believe that the final version of welfare reform will look anything like h r 1720 there is instead every indication now that there will be relentless pressure in conference and in negotiations with the white house to whittle away or jettison altogether all that is progressive and worthwhile about h r 1720 or alternatively to accept dangerous proposals like granting states broad waiver authority as the price for retaining the positive elements of h r 1720 in the final compromise under these circumstances the odds of producing an equitable decent compromise seem very long indeed by the time the process is completed we are just as likely to end up with a welfare reform bill that makes the system worse than one that makes it modestly better if network were a voluntary job training program we could afford to be more sanguine about the prospects of losing much of what is good about this bill and gaining many negative additions because a less than optimum outcome would mean simply that the bill would not be as helpful or as successful as it might otherwise be but because network is a compulsory program the stakes are much higher an unfavorable compromise and inadequate bill will not merely be less helpful to peopleit will actively hurt them for this reason as much as i support many of the provisions in h r 1720 and appreciate the sincerity and dedication of our colleagues harold ford and tom downey i believe that

form 5500 the ipa report and the actuarial report to the irs in turn the irs gives the reports to the pwba but by the time the pwba gets this information the information is usually at least 2 years old indeed sometimes the reports are filed late and sometimes the reports are not filed at all yet delinquent filers are not fined and no provisions exist that provides for obtaining missing files even if the pwba has the ipa report many times the report does not reflect erisa violations that have occurred inspite of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa guide entitled audits of employee benefit plans and the reporting requirements set out in erisa in fact the ipas all too often do not perform the necessary testing many reports fail to contain one or more of the disclosures required the aicpa guidelines and the tatute often times ipas interpret important events as insignificant or a disclosure requirement as repetitive many times too important events are obscured within a report the ipas role is crucial it is often the only source the pwba has of accurately interpreting financial state11107 1 ments few members of pwba have the background necessary to complete an audit themselvesnot to mention their lack of personnel and time the ipa assumes a public responsibility to the plans participants nevertheless todays auditing standards allows an auditor to assume management integrity unless his examination reveals evidence to the contrary thus his duty to look for fraud is limited the results can be disastrous especially when you recognize that the majority of financial fraud practices involve top management further a company is free toand often doeschange auditors if the company disagrees with the ipas accounting policies see generally report

suppliers for strategic component parts to our defense base through my experiences during the vietnam war at the federal maritime commission i learned that even the best of allies sometimes do not support the policy of the united states and can almost cripple our efforts if they refuse to ship our supplies twentyfive years later it seems that our dependence upon foreign supplies and money has become so great that unitedstates trade policy is being dictated by that dependence the congress of the united states cannot write a trade bill without being threatened by the producers of a foreign government that were we to ban their products many of our own production lines will be shut down one foreign national companytoshibawhose subsidiarytoshiba machinewas found guilty of selling strategic machines to the sovietsnow supplies approximately 50 percent of the memory chips needed by the united states but that is not all that we depend upon from the toshiba corp the washington post in a may 1 article last sunday by robert a rosenblatt of the los angeles times reports toshiba america the companys unitedstates subsidiary employs 6 000 americans who make laptop computers in irvine ca television sets and microwave ovens in tennessee television tubes in new york copying maching parts in south dakota and engineering controls in oklahoma but beyond that thousands of other americans are employed by companies that use key toshiba components or sell toshiba imports under their own labels farther on in the article rosenblatt quotes a lobbyist for one of the firms dependent upon component parts as saying members of congress and their staffs didnt fully believe how important a player in the marketplace toshiba is 0 0 and they didnt want to hear that unitedstates companies could be heavily dependent on japanese technology believe it hear it now not only is the toshibadependence dictating unitedstates policy but according to a story from the san francisco examiner on march 13 1988 written by paul freiberger suggests that toshiba is a major player in the recent memory chip shortage and the consequent inflation in the price of computer chips the story states that japan accounts for more than 90 percent of the dram chip market industry sources have told me that toshiba accounts for 50 percent of that amount in order to understand what is going on here if you recall the japanese were found to be guilty of dumping memory chips at below market value several years ago quoting from the examiner article moreover the japanese were dumping in third countries like taiwan further damaging unitedstates chip manufacturers the glut of japanese chips sent the unitedstates chip industry into a tailspin japanese firms meanwhile benefitted from government subsidies and a financial picture that places little importance on shortterm profit continuing the quote the trade agreement established fair market value prices for semiconductors including such essential memory chips as 256 kilobit and 1 megabit drams dynamic random access memory used in computers it banned thirdcountry dumping and japan agreed to open its economy further to unitedstates goods yet by 1986 most unitedstates firms had abandoned the memory business entirely in the ideal scenario chip prices would have risen to a point where american companies could afford to return to the fray instead only two unitedstates firms texas instruments inc of dallas and micron technology of boise idaho remain in the dram business and they make a relatively tiny number of chips japan accounts for more than 90 percent of the dram market according to dataquest inc a san jose market research firm meanwhile japanese companies have raised prices of memory chips above the fair market value let me repeat that meanwhile japanese companies have raised prices of memory chips above the fair market value we forced the japanese to make a lot of money but created a capacity problem say william h gates chairman of microsoft corp the redmond wash pc software giant that makes the standard operating system software used on ibm desktop computers some industry observers see the chip drought as part of japans strategy to undercut unitedstates computermakers in favor of its own just as chip dumping aided the japanese semiconductor industry let me repeat that some industry observers see the chip drought as part of japans strategy to undercut united states computer makers in favor of its own just as chip dumping aided the japanese semiconductor industry they say japanese firms are diverting memory chips away from the united states to gain clout in the united states market for computers and other products they sayand i am repeating that againjapanese firms are diverting memory chips away from the united states to gain clout in the united states market for computers and other products i would like to interject here references to the japanese conspiracy a book that i have been reading segments from on this floor from time to time to point out to the american public what really happens to american industry how it was deliberately conspired by the japanese ministry of international trade and industry and the japanese manufacturers to destroy american manufacturers by targeting them and then going after them with the full backing of the japanese government and here we are talking about it in this very very important computer game seeing right now what is happening right now again i am going to continue the article from the san francisco examiner were seeing companies like sony introduce competitive desktop computers that are very dram intensive and i dont hear any chitchat about sony being out of dram says scott mcnealy president of sun microsystems of mountain view in fact i dont hear anything from japanese vendors complaining about a dram shortage on the computer side of the house nothing about a japanese shortage just a shortage in this country sheridan tatsuno a semiconductor analyst at dataquest says japans ministry of international trade and industry that is mitihas helped cause the shortage in order to derail the trade accord and prevent unitedstates chip makers from influencing future policy now that is what is happening today in this country of course the japanese deny these allegations but the evidence from the amount of chips available to japanese producers seems to prove the case that the japanese are punishing us for the 1986 semiconductor agreement and the frightening truth is that we have put them in a position to do it if as a manufacturing nation we had put them at a cost disadvantage with the falling dollar thencreate a shortage in the international supplybeing sure that your own producers are well taken care ofand push the prices up all the while putting your competition out of business either through pricing or slowing down production beautiful strategy isnt it i hope the congress believes it lobbyists for the toshiba cause on the hill made great gains by pointing to the numbers of jobs involved in a ban on toshiba products6 000 direct employees and then all of the indirect employees i do not imow how many americans would be thrown out of work with a toshiba ban but i do know that every figure i have seenwhether for imports or exportssays that for each billion dollars in trade 22 500 jobs are involved in the united states of america this year our trade deficit is predicted to be in excess of 150 billion a rough multiplication of that number gives a figure in excess of 300 000 american jobs which will be lost in this 1 year due to our purchases abroad and that does not count the jobs lost to last years deficit or the deficit the year before and before the toshiba threat of losing less jobs than the trade deficit is costing us the real threat is that we are losing our freedom to act in the congress that we are possibly losing our personal computer industrythe same way we lost our television industry and our radio industry and much of our machine tool industry if people have not believed the intent of the japanese beforethis frightening exercise in power which we have just seen displayed on capital hill over the trade bill should forever dispel any notion that the japanese intend to share any industryany market with the united states it should also dispel any notion that the japanese are only interested in selling into our markets the japanese have shown by their behavior that they are perfectly willing to suggest to the united states treasury that if they do not get their way they will not purchase our treasury notes in the same issue of the washington post on sunday may 1 senator evans of washington statein an interview about his reasons for voting against a veto override on the trade bill says about demanding reciprocity from the japanese in allowing our primary security dealers equal access to their markets he saysmaybe we will get what we want out of that proposal but it could be a decision on their part to retaliate or in some fashion withdraw their investing in unitedstates government securities now who in the world do our members think is supporting our annual fiscal deficit primarily the japanese buying our debt if they decide they are less interested in buying that debt that alone could create waves in our financial markets that

former air traffic controllers there is a shocking difference in our air traffic control work force compared to 1981 although the current workers provide conscientious service and are a credit to the system there just are not enough of them six years have passed since the strike but we still have not reached the level of staff that we had in 1981 more shocking is the fact that there were less than 10 000 full performance controllersthe ones qualified to conduct all air traffic control dutiesin the ranks during 1987 compared to over 13 000 in this dearth of air traffic controllers takes on added significance when the increasing amount of air traffic is taken into consideration since deregulation took hold in the early 1980s the amount of air traffic has been steadily increasing the level we have today is around 450 000 passengers per year which is nearly twice the level we had at the time of the strike clearly this added pressure is an unhealthy source of stress on our air traffic control system a good measure of this problem is the amount of overtime that is required of our air traffic control work force in 1986 the few controllers that we had were required to put in a total of 614 000 hours this is a greater amount than the much larger prestrike force had to handle i for one do not think we ought to blame deregulation for this situation because of deregulation the american public now has much greater freedom of choice in air travel there are more flights with more competition which has resulted in lower fares thisby any measureis a good thing but the increase in air travel should focus our attention on the needs of the air traffic control system if we are to fully enjoy the benefits of deregulation we must be sure that we have the means to manage this increase in traffic we have no business allowing air travel to grow at such a fast pace if we are not willing to take the steps necessary to ensure air safety this does not have to mean reregulation but it does mean that we must have enough air traffic controllers to get the job done not 3 or 4 years down the line but this year of course one of the chief obstacles to solving this problem has been the long training time required for producing air traffic controllers it still takes 2 years or more for a controller to reach the full performance level under these conditions we will not be able to reach the staff levels of 1981 for many years however if we adopt the measure before us we can rapidly increase our work force to include all the fully qualified workers necessary to get the job done rehiring former controllers would not require the extensive training given to raw recruits but could be completed in under 6 months by putting them through refresher courses by supporting this measure i do not by any means support the right to strike against the federal government or against the public safety i view the steps taken by patco in 1981 as wrong and that is why i supported the president at the time the air traffic controllers should never have gone on strike at the same time we should not oppose this bill merely because we want to punish those who did go on strike in 1981 the president made it clear that a strike would not be tolerated and those who walked off the job paid a stiff penalty for their actions they have been denied employment in their chosen field for over 61 years this means that they have not been able to advance themselves through the system to more senior positions and they have paid a tremendous price in lost wages and in lost selfesteem the precedent has been clearly set there is no right to strike against the public good no further punishment is necessary we ought to now allow some of the former controllers to make a contribution to air safety by allowing them back into the federal system this step is necessary so that the law will be consistent under the directive issued by president reagan on december 9 1981 the fired controllers are allowed to seek federal employment as long as it is unrelated to air traffic control since they are clearly eligible for federal employment lets not pretend there is a principle which forbids it why then do we continue to bar them from the work for which they are most qualified lets clear up this contradiction and put them back to work this measure has been pushed aside for too long the time to enact this law is now if we have enacted this legislation in the past when we had the chance the problem would already be cleared up as it stands now we can act to impact the system this year if we act now

i know that they have worked very hard on this subject let me also say i do not know mr murphy i do not know austin murphy at all i came here like a lot of my colleagues to listen and to make an independent judgment of how i am going to vote on this thing but what i have heard so far has troubled me and i have listened intently to both sides i am troubled by the charges that have been raised and the way the charges have been raised and the way the charges have been articulated here today against this gentleman i hear statements like you have to look at the totality of the charges what does that mean to me it means each and every one of those charges may be weak on its face and i think from what i have heard indeed they are weak on their face but we have a number of charges to consider and we are asked to consider the fact that the committee did in fact spend a lot of time 6 days of hearings and that they spent a lot of time reading what does that mean it means they worked hard but because they worked so hard and because they worked so long and because the vote was 11 to 0 does that mean that we then go along with whatever the committee says this question of the voting card we have all seen since we have been here instances where people have voted and found out at the end of the year a vote was not recorded time and time again i have heard members get up on the floor and say i was here and i voted that machine screwed up somehow when they say the evidence is crystal clear that somebody voted i do not accept that i do not accept that at all the statement was made that we have a responsibility to protect the honor of this chamber yes indeed we do but we also have the responsibility to protect the integrity of everybody who serves in this chamber and from what i have heard here so far i am very very troubled by the charges i think that this man is being singled out by the media attention and i must in my own case support the gentleman from pennsylvania any doubt that i have would be resolved in his favor"], [0.0012264251708984375, 0.5012264251708984, 0, "i would like to point out that section 2 of this bill states as follows the first sentence after the title of section a there are authorized to be appropriated to the environmental protection agency for environmental research development and demonstration activities the following sums and it delineates the amounts of those sums some of those are for activities which are authorized under the clean air act so we have money authorized here the amendment i have will use little or no funds of those there is nothing in here that says it is prohibited from using those funds the amendment that i offered and as i say has no budgetary impact in addition to what is already authorized under this bill it provides for the development of state plans to take care of the problems of acid rain it authorizes studies which are research programs it also authorizes development programs to control the emissions consistent with the clean air act by amending the clean air act to do that both for stationary sources and mobile sources and also authorizes certain field experiments i believe it is well within the authority that is gathered and given by this bill which is a bill of general nature within the areas being authorized so i feel it is well within the jurisdiction of the committee there is no question about that and i believe it is germane"]]}
