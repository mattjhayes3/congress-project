for whom i have great respect this legislation is in response to a nationally orchestrated campaign of violence and it protects gravely threatened rights h r 796 is legislation in response to a nationally orchestrated campaign of violence and vandalism against reproductive health clinics as well as physical blockades and invasions of clinics these illegal activities have been preventing women from obtaining health care services and threatening the lives of health care providers from 1977 to april 1993 more than 1 000 acts of violence against reproductive health providers were reported in the united states including 36 bombings 81 arsons 131 death threats 84 assaults 2 kidnapings 327 clinic invasions and 1 murder since january 1992 71 chemical attacks have been reported in 15 states as well and in a recent nationwide survey 50 percent of the clinics responding reported experiencing extreme violencewith 25 percent of those clinics having experienced physical invasions or chemical attacks in 1993 alone this is another reason why the amendment that was mentioned the stenholmgekas amendment was not found in order this is in response to a national emergency the bill is also in response to the january supreme court ruling in bray versus alexandria which created a gap in federal law federal injunctive relief is no longer available for clinics under federal civil rights laws h r 796 will give the federal government the power to act when state and local authorities cannot or will not act to guarantee accese to these clinics where women especially poor women go for a wide range of services that include family planning prenatal examinations mammograms pap smears as well as abortion services the bill applies only to the use of force threat of force or physical obstruction that intentionally injures intimidates or interferes with any person who is obtaining or providing reproductive health services the bill protects all expressive conduct including peaceful picketing or other peaceful demonstration protected by the first amendment we are talking about illegal conduct not peaceful picketing this bill is not about abortionit is about protecting womens access to reproductive health services and may i in response to comments made on the rule indicate that the bill carefully crafted does state that nething in this section shall be construed to prohibit any expressive conduct including peaceful picketing or other peaceful demonstrations protected from legal prohibition by the first article the first amendment to the constitution i would like to stress that because you are going to hear from opponents of the rule and opponents of the bill that it infringes on first amendment rights it could not be more explicit in the bill the bill is not about abortion it is about protecting womens success to reproductive health services it has been carefully crafted to protect the first amendment rights as i mentioned it has been narrowly drawn to specifically address this problem without providing too broad a federal role this is another response to the amendment that was considered not germane changes were made in both the subcommittee and

reproductive health services and denying them their rights to such care it is important to remember that those who demonstrated in the sixties these were attempts to obtain the rights of citizenship

a loophole in our federal law which allows for the possession of a handgun by a minor or the transfer or sale to a minor by an unlicensed dealer currently federal law only applies to licensed gun dealers who sell or de liver s handgun to someone under 21 it does not address unlicensed dealers who sell or dliver handguns to minors or address the possession of a handgun by a minor while some states have recently passed laws regarding possession by a minor most states including my own home state of pennsylvania have not yet while this bill takes an important first step in solving this problem i believe that we must go further in our efforts to combat the rising tide of violence and gun used by children that is why i have introduced the juvenile handgun control act of 1993 which would impose stiffer penalties regarding the possession of a handgun by a minor and most importantly harshly punish the true cdminals the people who sell or give these guns to our children my legislation like h r 3098 makes certain exceptions regarding possession by a minor including hunting or parental consent but it would go further by setting a three strike system a first offense by a minor would be punishable by probation or detainment of not more than a year and a maximum fine of 10 000 or both a second offense by a minor would be classified a juvenile felony and punishable by probation or detainment of i to 4 years or a maximum fine of 20 000 or both finally the third offense would require that the minor be transferred to a district criminal court tried as an adult and imprisoned for i to 4 years and fined a maximum of 50 000 the bill i have introduced would also make it a federal offense for a person to sell or transfer a handgun to a minor without the consent of the childs parent or legal guardian it also calls for harsher penalties for someone who gives or sells a handgun to a minor who they know has been convicted of a crime of violence this is the real problem that is plaguing our streets today the accessibility of these guns for our children in order to make significant strides in making our streets safer we must also punish the people who

disclosure of convenience fees service charges and other amounts often added to the face value of entertainment and sporting event tickets an estimated 400 million such tickets were sold last yearmore than double the amount sold just 3 years ago as ticket sales have increased so too have the methods used to sell the market such tickets indeed with the advent of the communications superhighway sellers of entertainment tickets likely will have many additional avenues available to them that are not feasible today this legislation does not inhibit these new and innovative approaches nor does it inhibit the growth of the entertainment and sporting industries or marketing firms that are associated with such industries rather this simple legislation merely seeks to inform the ordinary consumer who purchases these tickets of any additional charges or fees that are assessed above the face value of any such ticket the subcommittee on information justice transportation and agriculture which representative condit chairs recently held hearigs regarding these and related issues these hearings have raised questions about the competitive nature of firms engaged in ticketing practices some of whom have exclusive contracts with stadiums theaters and other entertainment venues while the legislation we introduce today does not address these competitive issues someof which are beyond the jurisdiction of the energy and commerce committee the recent hearings have pointed out that ordinary ticket consumers may be subjected to increasing convenience or service charges levied for the benefit of the ticketing agent or the venue the legislation does not attempt to address the issue of whether any of these additional fees are reasonable or justified indeed such fees could reflect an appropriate value to the consumer for certain services provided but merely seeks to notify the consumer who seeks to purchase tickets of the existence and amount of these addon charges this legislation makes it unlawful for persons who sell or resell entertainment or sporting event tickets one to fail to disclose to the purchaser prior to the purchase of any such ticketany fee charge or other assessment to be imposed in excess of the face amount of the ticket and two to fail to have the amount of any such fee charge or assessment printed on the ticket or on a receipt evidencing any such ticket sale under the bill this federal prohibition will be enforced by the federal trade commission an independent regulatory agency that has authority over unfair and deceptive commercial practices under the federal trade commission act 15 unitedstatesc 45 et seq as well state attorneys general are empowered under the bill to enforce the prohibition on behalf of affected residents in their states in this regard the bill parallels other commercial practices legislation developed by the committee on energy and commerce during the past few years including the telephone disclosure and
