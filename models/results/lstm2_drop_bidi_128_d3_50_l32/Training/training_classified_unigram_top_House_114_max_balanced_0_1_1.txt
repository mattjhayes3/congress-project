is downright irresponsible for this loophole to continue to put guns in the hands of those who shouldnt have them it is just as irresponsible for republicans to allow the nra and gun manufacturers to dictate how the gun industry is regulated that is insane should we also allow the tobacco industry to write a bill regulating cigarettes the answer to that is no we should protect the people who

excitement we have of coming init is a new congress it is a new direction for our country i think we have a stronger majority in the house of representatives of the republican house as well it is a different majority over in the senate a lot of people arent too concerned with what party it is or what partisan issues are they want to see results that is what i am looking for as well many bills were sent out of the house last session and languished on a desk over on the senate side and i think we will now see action on those commonsense measures that are going to help jobs in america help our economy rebound and help people get out from under the grip of government power and government regulation that is just killing their hopes and killing their ideals we are looking for that in this new session and we expect we will be held accountable to make that happen it is not going to be a miracle we are not going to get all the results we hoped for but at least there are going to be things on the record now that have gone through this house and have gone to the senate that will be showing the american people what our agenda is and what it has been about bringing it back home to california i represent the first district in the northeast portion of the state it is a beautiful district i am very proud to have been elected for a second time to represent the first district it is an area that has a lot of great resources that benefit our whole state even our whole country to be able to have my family here with me in washington attending the festivities the honor of being sworn in and getting started getting a fast start going to work here in this new 114th has just been a real delight what we need to be happening in california is a better and wiser use of our resources you may have seen at the end of the last session we were working towards better management of our water supply now we have a deluge of rain once in a while even when we are suffering drought for the last few years in california the water seems to all come at once if it isnt being saved in snowpack it will come quickly via rain through our streams and that is an opportunity for us that we should be retaining that behind the dam so that we have as well the water that gets down the feather river and the sacramento river and can be transferred and put somewhere to be used later we have the ability to have the water allocated as needed for fish for habitat but there is excess water that needs to be stored i dont know why that isnt the automatic protocol but congressa bill i cosponsored with many of my other colleagues put forward reminding the bureau of reclamation and others that they need to retain this extra water it isnt needed for fish and it isnt needed for the normal runs so we will have more stored later that is what we will continue to work for but i still go back to the vision that people before us had that have given us shasta dam lake oroville and the whole state water project and the central valley project that we have in our state that we have benefited from for so many years that everybody benefits from whether you are an environmentalist a farmer a person who lives in a city or if you just have a tap in the country if you are not on a well you are probably benefiting from these projects because we had the vision in the past to build them and we didnt have nearly the roadblocks now of course we have great environmental concerns and environmental awareness to do things better than we did in the 1850s or the 1880s or what have you we know how to do these things but it doesnt mean that because of a handful of people who dont want to see things happen we stop the progress for all the rest of us so that is what we will be pushing for in this new congress to build more water storage we can do that in northern california sites reservoir and there are other projects that can be enhanced to retain more water and there are smarter ways to keep the water that we do have to make the water go further because it is necessary the way california is suffering from droughts agricultural land is going to be the first thing to go any time an emergency can be declared to switch whatever water does get to agriculture to meet other needs around the state we have to take care of people first and we have to take care of cities but when we see so much being run out through the golden gate that could be saved or for questionable tactics on fish that really havent been proven for that kind of habitat then we are missing the mark so we will be working very hard to add to our water storage and to be smarter with the water we have available to us because we cant count on a record rainfall this year we are very thankful and we have been blessed with good rainfall in november and the early part of december but it has tailed off lately we will need record rainfall the rest of the season up through the spring to have the kind of water we need to get through a good crop year in the meantime we should be doing everything possible in government to enhance to retain to be smarter with the water we have when we hear ideas of removing dams in the north part of the state part of my district that produce hydroelectric power because of dubious studies that might benefit fish we are hurting our region of the state we are hurting our grid by taking enough renewable electricity off the grid that would somehow need to be replaced with other green power to manage 70 000 homes in the state because of dubious lack of science we need to battle through this and have smarter use of our resources another thing that we are very rich in in our part of the state is timber each summer we see the crisis of nonmanagement of our timber and what that looks like it is in the air it is in our brown skies we get to breathe that the people within those communities are wondering why their mills are shut down and why their storefronts are boarded up and why they dont have jobs and why they have things like domestic violence increasing because people dont have work in those communities sometimes because their industry has been taken away from them i sit on the natural resources committee to get after both of these and other issuesour water our timber use and other resourcesthat are so necessary to the rural part of the state the rural west that has been languishing for many years ever since the endangered species act was passed in 1973 for good reason at the time to save the bald eagle we have bald eagles in our rice fields where i live at home but we have gone so far beyond that rural america is suffering from this type of regulation that it isnt even proven to help recover a single species indeed somewhere around 1 percent at best of species have been recovered after 40plus years of the endangered species act that is pretty deplorable for what the cost has been to the people to the jobs and for the communities and their values but i am still optimistic that america is turning the corner and seeing things a little bit differently and that the job needs to come back home and the jobs at home need to be revived once again as a grower of grain myself we look at our alternatives do we want to be in a situation where in the past we were dependent on oil from people who dont like us much do we want to be in a position to have our grain crops the breadbasket of our nation do we want to become more dependent on that from people who maybe arent always a reliable ally overseas wheat from russia and rice from china do we want to rely on that or do we want to do the best we can my fellow farmers across the country and in my area they are good stewards of the land many have been there for many many generations some of the ranchers i know their families have been farming and ranching for 160 years in northern california my own family 80plus years we know how to take care of the land we know what needs to be done it is sustainable to use that buzz word that goes around a lot these days if it wasnt sustainable the land wouldnt still produce so this is the type of thing we are fighting for if we dont have a breadbasket in this country what will america rely on to keep us fed with the unrest we have in the world ultimately if we cant fuel our own armies if it becomes necessary what kind of position will we be in to defend ourselves or our allies like in europe like in israel like in japan or others we have great relations and great trade with we are in great peril right now if we keep our head in the sand on these issues we need to look at the resources we have as i look at the young people in the audience tonight one of the first things that i am reminded of is that we are running an 18 trillion national debt we have lived for the future in the present on someone elses money and so every dollar we have every dollar that comes in we have to be good stewards of much better than in the past so every dollar has to go for the type of infrastructure that will improve our transportation system our water system our flood control system and keep our communities safe and not on frivolous things i am reminded in california instead of this water infrastructure that we so desperately need we have had several years of drought to remind us they are still pursuing a highspeed rail system in california as a former state legislator we were right in the middle of that as it was coming to a head what will the rail cost voters were told then 33 billion to go from san francisco to los angeles at 220 miles per hour it isnt even close to being that project anymore and the price has tripled at least it has gone from 33 billion to at least 98 billion by the admission of the rail authority in a hearing we had in the state legislature back then they are still chasing this dream now they have tried to downsize it to be a 68 billion project to this day right now they have still only identified 13 billion 10 billion from the state bond and 3 billion from the federal government via the stimulus act of 2009 so 13 billion of a needed and downsized 68 billion project they are 55 billion short and they still think today they are going to go find that money from the private sector they are staying away in droves there is no way that it is going to be built anywhere near on time anywhere near on any kind of budget or that the riders they would have will ever be able to afford to ride it why dont we take a fraction of that money of the 13 billion or the 68 billion or whatever number it is and put it towards the water storage we need we could build two really nice dams with 68 billion especially with private sector money that wants to come in and be a partner on this lets get it done because this is the infrastructure that will help our state and help the people and help bring jobs back to rural california and rural america i am looking for help from my other colleagues from other states especially other western states that have water infrastructure needs they are looking at themselves lets work together on this that is what made us great back in the day we have had these huge projects that have made so much hydroelectric power we like green power we like renewable power when it rains behind a dam you have renewable power and it is reliable and it is low cost much more so than windmills and solar panels that require government assistance to put them in and keep them going lets do the right thing here and allow these things to happen all that private sector to happen i am optimistic in this congress that we can make that case and put it in front of the american people i ask the president to join with us and help on that whether it is that or the further development of energy that we need in this country to stay ahead of the curve we are seeing prices coming down amazingly hydraulic fracturing has played a big part in us seeing the price of fuel in some areasnot in california but other states going below 2 a gallon in california we are still taxing ourselves and thinking up capandtrade measures to drive the cost up so we will be our own island of high costs but the other 49 states god bless you you have it pretty good the vision that we have had to do these things is what we need desperately going forward in 2015 because when we are productive like what we can produce in northern california with agriculture with timber with our mine resources all of the other things that come from the land that sets the table for everything else across our district and across our state and across the whole country that puts us back to work again we have trillions of dollars offshore that would love to be repatriated back to this country if we had any kind of constant as to what the tax burden would be for those dollars for those businesses and investment that needs to be here any kind of consistency for what our regulatory burden would be so they could predict if they are to put 30year loans and 30year infrastructure in place will they be able to do business 5 years from now we would be bringing american jobs back if we could repatriate that money back here so lets get it done we dont come here in congressat least i haventbecause it is nice to wear a suit and tie we come here to get results to be results oriented we need to use real facts real figures real budgets real numbers to get to the core of what we are supposed to be doing as to what the founders had set for our government the government is doing a lot more things it has no business doing and it cant do well lets make sure that we are doing and we have the economy we have the engineering to generate so we have a functioning school system it has the funding it needs at fair and proper levels for our law enforcement so they are not left wanting for the equipment and backup they need and for the folks deployed overseas defending our borders as well as helping our allies we shouldnt leave them wanting while they are deployed and certainly with the mess that the va system is when they come back home the promises made to them are broken and the shame that we should all feel when our veterans so many are left homeless or simply begging to have their claims processed i am confident in this new congress that the house and the senate can work together and put these ideas forward we can put them out in front of the american people have the accountability have the oversight that our job demands we will get there so whether it is now or 2 years from now i challenge the president to look at these things from a commonsense way of thinking think about america first that is what we will be doing in this house and over in the senate so from northern california to the rest of the country help us all to be productive and to live the lives we choose to give our kids a chance to live at home to find jobs and opportunities in their own communitiesfarming ranching mining whatever it is or related industries in those small towns that so many are boarded up now let them have that chance to live at home not have to go someplace else go to a big city somewhere a

america who have not yet left behind young children and young widows it is our duty in this house to fight for them with whatever energy and inspiration that we can find within us to ensure that what starts as a good idea becomes law the pfc joseph dwyer veterans peer support program is not a new idea it may be a new idea for this chamber we created it in new york state back in 2012 at that time i was in the new york state senate and we created it as part of the 20122013 state budget as we just heard from the gentleman from pennsylvania veterantoveteran peer support veterans helping veterans is the key we started the program in four counties in new york suffolk county which is my home county jefferson county home of the 10th mountain division fort drum rensselaer county and saratoga county the program was so successful in these four counties and by the way operating at just 200 000 per county here in washington we talk about programs in the billions the trillions and the hundreds of millions in my home county we helped hundreds of veterans in just that first year hundreds of veterans were helped over 400 and 200 000 we know firsthand how many lives were saved as a result it was so successful it started in four counties and expanded to over a dozen in new york state we are so proud of the dwyer program i just came to congress this is my first term i was sworn in january of 2015 there may be no other mission during my time here in this chamber that will be more satisfying for me personally than to do my part to hopefully save at least one veterans life but there are so many more that can be saved if this chamber takes up this bill and makes it law it doesnt matter whether you live in one of the most populated counties in america of veterans like suffolk or if you live in a county that might not be that well populated overall anywhere else in this country if you raised your hand and you are willing to lay down your life in protection of our freedoms and liberties for that flag for everything that makes our country great to protect it and defend it when you come home you should have shoes on your feet there should be food on your table there should be a roof over your head some come home with the physical wounds of war others come home with the mental wounds of war our veterans are fighting for us all of usnot just for their family or friends but for strangers too isnt it our duty while we are here as elected representatives to be fighting for not just those veterans with the mental wounds of war whom we know but the countless others who are under the radar right now they are under the radar because they dont know where to go for help within our communities we have veterans we have veterans service organizationsyou know like the vfw the american legion the vietnam veterans of america the list goes onand we have mental health professionals who want to offer their services we have others who may want to provide a venue for a meeting others who may want to provide food the setting is not that hard to put into place for someone from our community who may live around the block from any member of this chamber the setting is not that hard to put together for that veteran to go to that room and be with maybe 8 10 veterans understanding the struggles that they are going through so that they can share each others stories and help each other cope with what are the mental wounds of war it is our duty it is our opportunity to be able to bring these veterans together and to save lives as was noted earlier the statistics are staggering an estimated 22 veteran deaths per day22 that is 8 000 in a year it was just about a month ago when the department of veterans affairs indicated that 17 of these 22 individuals werent even in the va system some dont go for help because they dont know where to go others might fear the consequences what is so important is with the dwyer program maintaining confidentiality so our veterans wont fear that they might lose their job because they are going for help that is incredibly important as well a recent new york university medical center report indicated over 270 000 vietnamera veterans still suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder these figures are alarming they are disturbing the va doesnt currently offer what we are talking about this is different we are hearing about how some of our veterans are being helped because of petsdogs horsesfishing other activities lets think outside the box lets not think of just the same way of doing things that have not worked inside the department of veterans affairs lets do something different we are not starting from scratch i would encourage any member of this house to look at what we are doing in my home county of suffolk i am proud to say that we are leading the way in america and there is a model there that works and should be replicated everywhere staffing shortages untrained support staff lacking family support services and access to services during nonbusiness hours are just some of the problems that have been reported at the department of veterans affairs i recently introduced legislation h r 4513 which would expand nationally the pfc joseph p dwyer veterans peer support program pfc joseph dwyer was from my district his home was mount sinai new york a lot of people know joseph dwyer because of an iconic photo from the start of the iraq war this picture was on national news it was on the front cover of magazines it was that iconic picture of that american soldier post9 11 at the start of the war holding a wounded iraqi boy as his unit was fighting its way up to baghdad it looked like joseph came home in one piece a hero while it may have seemed that he came home in one piece because he didnt have some of the physical wounds of war that we unfortunately see from other heroes he came back with posttraumatic stress disorder pfc dwyer died in 2008 matina his young widow was left behind meaghan his 2yearold daughter was left behind this was an effort that was launched in his honor the pfc joseph p dwyer veterans peer support program it is for our veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury it provides a safe confidential and educational platform where all veterans are welcome to meet with other veterans to build vettovet relationships in support of one anothers successful transition from military life to postservice life we were able to conduct 148 group sessions serving 450 veterans in my home county of suffolk just in the first year since 2013 the program has helped now into the thousands as we count veterans from across new york with ptsd and tbi through my bill the secretary of veterans affairs would be authorized to make grants to state and local entities to carry out peertopeer mental health programs the bill would secure 25 million over a 3year period to establish a grant program at the va that will provide up to 250 000 in funding for all selected entities such as nonprofits congressionally chartered vsos or state or local agencies to implement the peertopeer program lets think about that 250 000 the denver va hospital construction project originally budgeted for just over 600 million is operating 800 million to 900 million over budget 800 million to 900 million over budget the department of veterans affairs came to a committee on veterans affairs hearing which i am proud to serve on that committee and they said that they are operating off what they referred to as an artificial budget has anyone ever heard of an artificial budget i had one colleague who was asking for when she was going to get a timeline of when we would have an actual budget unable to get an answer she asked the followup question not trying to embarrass the department she ended up asking the followup question of when she was going to get a timeline of when she was going to get a timeline of when we were going to have an actual budget when 800 million to 900 million ends up getting spent over budget think of the hundreds of veterans in one county alone who could be helped for just 200 000 the money is there when the secretary of the va when the department of veterans affairs signs off on a relocation and incentive bonus for one of their own whose position is in washington d c and she wants to go to philadelphia where her family is and take over a position in charge of their veterans affairs hospital she arranges a move to get the person the gentleman in charge of the philly va hospital moved to los angeles so now she gets the job she wanted she is closer to family and she gets herself a relocation and incentive bonus over 200 000 the office of inspector general was outraged they made a report recommending that this gets referred to the department of justice the department of veterans affairs was so outraged at this report from the inspector general that they ended up turning on their own inspector general not referring anything to the department of justice one of the responsibilities of this house is oversight you look at our constitution article i is long all the powers granted to congress look at the powers of the president and the executive it is short within that article it talks about the oversight of this body oversight to make sure that money is being spent appropriately wisely efficiently and that people are held accountable when they are not doing the right thing on behalf of our veterans my bill would effectively and efficiently as it has proven provide 24 7 peertopeer mental health services by trained peer specialists for veterans reservists and national guardsmen wherever and whenever they are needed in addition the dwyer program will provide group and individual meetings to help foster a greater sense of inclusion and community amongst our veterans and as i mentioned earlier the program also addresses the many privacy concerns that veterans and other servicemembers have as the dwyer program representatives themselves will be veterans and would not be responsible to the department of veterans affairs therefore easing reporting concerns this is a bill that i have been working on since i took office in january 2015 working closely with the house committee on veterans affairs that i serve on the american legion other vsos the national disability rights network various healthcare providers on long island as well as my veterans advisory panel which is made up of representatives from veterans groups and veterans themselves i want to thank the dwyer family for all the inspiration the sacrifice of joseph has provided to so many in our community and our country and for me included there would not be a dwyer program in the state of new york without the sacrifice of joseph dwyer i want to thank the county of suffolk and specifically tom ronayne who runs the veterans service office for the countless hours and the love that he and his team have put into this effort that we talk about here tonight on the house floor to chris delaney josephs friend who has served our country as well as tom has and has done so much through his work with 911 veterans and also serving on my veterans advisory panel i think of so many individuals who have given so much of their personal time to make this work it is an honor to be here on behalf of that team advocating for this cause i unapologetically love my country i believe that we live in the greatest nation in the world i will say that the highlight of my day during my time in iraq was going back to my tent at the end of the day there would be care packages waiting for us from strangers8yearolds 9yearolds from other corners of the countrywith pictures of tanks and flags and soldiers cards saying thank you for your service the generation that came before me didnt get that treatment just think right now we have servicemembers in iraq afghanistan and elsewhere who were 4 years old on 9 11 their entire generation it is all they know they went through their entire life from 4 years old to today knowing exactly what they were signing up for and actually knowing what they were signing up for gave them all the motivation and inspiration in the world they needed to put on that uniform it is a great feeling the first time you get to put on our nations uniform for me it wasnt a feeling that i had about myself when i looked in the mirror and i saw myself wearing a uniform it was thinking of those generations who came before us like our nations greatest generation it is a challenge for our generation to earn the title of our nations next greatest generation maybe that generation is now serving here in this chamber where 31 members of the house are under the age of 40 including new members who have come in who served in iraq and afghanistan 1715 as i think about that 8yearold and 9yearold who wrote that card to that stranger they did not know and as we stand here today enjoying our freedoms we think of those who are in harms waystrangerswe dont know themthey are going to come back after seeing things none of us would ever want to see in our lives and will we be there for them there is one other bill that was filed in this chamber called the fairness for veterans act an iraq veteran from long island kristofer goldsmith received a general discharge which is a lessthanhonorable discharge as a result he doesnt have the same veterans benefits that someone who is separated with an honorable discharge would receive he came back with posttraumatic stress disorder he attempted to take his own life when your posttraumatic stress disorder ends up leading to a discharge with a lessthanhonorable discharge isnt it our responsibility to ensure that they have the ability to diagnose and treat their posttraumatic stress disorder what if they are applying for an upgrade of their discharge status should we put the burden on that veteran to prove that the circumstances that led to their discharge is connected to their posttraumatic stress disorder no this bill addresses that by putting the burden on the government to show that the circumstances werent connected to what led to that discharge we must fight for all our veterans who are willing to fight for us my bills will bring muchneeded supportthe dwyer program and the fairness for veterans actto millions of veterans if you think of all those not only serving now but in the future and their families passing these bills and others to address veterans mental health is of the highest priority for many of us in this chamber i will work every day in congress to spread awareness of these two bills and gather cosponsors and the support of veterans groups and mental health organizations from all across the country so that we pass this bill as soon as possible one last word about our families we often say thank you to our veterans as we should we say thank you to our first responders our law enforcement our volunteer firefighters our emts there are so many people who try to give back and who believe in service because they love their community their state their country they want to give back they want to leave this place better than they found it when i was in iraq this past christmas i met the command sergeant major for the 82nd airborne division he is on his 11th deployment i spoke earlier about that veteran who was 4 years old on 9 11 we also have that command sergeant major of the 82nd airborne division who was on his 11th deployment my daughters were born 1412 weeks early they were less than a pound and a half when they were born they spent their first 312 months in the hospital after they came out of the hospitali was stationed at fort bragg north carolina at the timei came across this woman who had three sets of triplets she lost one from each set all six of her kids had special needs her shopping cart was full her husband was on another deployment to iraq with a smile on her face with a very positive attitude she is telling my wife and i all the resources that were available to us on fort bragg so that we could be better parents that was the last time my wife or i would ever have the nerve to feel sorry for ourselves for what we were going through with our daughters they came home with about a dozen medications and heart monitors they were going through a hard time but this woman with her husband on another deployment her shopping cart full with six special needs kids with her as she is walking through the fort bragg commissary with that positive attitude and a smile on her face helping us be better parents i realized that when she was going to go home no one was going to be waiting with an outstretched hand and a hug and say thank you for your service these bills and this effort tonight are for our veterans and their families in need and it is the way that we give back this is how to say a proper thank you i yield back the

have found common ground time and time again then there are days like today when we just see things differently and perhaps read them differently that is what democracy is after all all about competing ideas that come to an open marketplace where we can have an upordown vote by the peoples representatives let me talk about a couple of things mr chair first of all there is the issue of net neutrality itself as my friend from california knows i put together a draft bill in january of 2015nearly a year and a half ago now that bill read no blocking no paid prioritization no throttling and it required transparency which are the core principles of an open internet order my colleagues on this side of the aisle are for all of those things the door remains open for democrats to join us in sponsoring that legislation we looked forward to that hopefully in going forward but we couldnt reach agreement on those very clear positions my colleague said gee they are for not having the federal communications commission regulate rates for broadband internet access service i think that is an accurate description of what the gentlewoman said she was for let me go to page 3 of the bill and just simply read from line 6 section 2 regulation of broadband rates prohibited line 7 notwithstanding any other provision of law the federal communications commission may not regulate the rates charged for broadband internet access service that is what this bill does now here is where people may get a little confused because on the one hand we say no tariffing that means no setting of the rates ahead of time we agree that that is a bad idea you have heard that from both sides of the aisle here yet you see the door that remains cracked open is the one they refuse to close so the chilling winter air of regulatory overreach blows through that crack in the door because if you dont close the ability of the agency to come in after the fact and say what you did on your rates we no longer think is correct then you have afterthefact rate regulation which is even more uncertain than upfront tariffing than an upfront setting of the rates it is with this that we find ourselves in disagreement with my friends across the aisle you see they are willing to say no tariffing in advance but they are not willing to close the door that allows the chilly air that will freeze out innovationa postaction regulationfrom occurring having been in small business for 20plus years earlier in my life and in the radio business i know what regulation is i know how to follow them i know what a public file is i actually kept them and did all of these things in our little radio station but i cannot imagine if after the fact my regulator could come back and say do you know those ads you sold to the local car dealer even though they were printed on your rate card and they were publicly disclosed and all of that we think maybe that was a little too high so you have to go back and you have to change things there is no definition of how far back they could go could they go back 6 months a year 2 years 10 years i dont know see i guess you get to the point that the internet thrives today in an environment where it was never regulated that is what really made it go off the charts is the innovators in silicon valley and i daresay in my district in oregon and elsewhere all over the world literally there is no centralonly point of innovation when it comes to the internet and technology it is global the economy has flourished globally and has done all that without three commissionersor two commissioners and one chairman three people in america deciding what you can and cant do you have got to go mama can i daddy can i can i after the fact is it going to be okay this is the new environment when you treat the internet like an old black dialup phone fundamentally that is what chairman wheeler decided to do with pressure from the white house they lost their independence as an agency when they went down this path to say that the internet is now like an old phone line or as you heard the former member of the public utility commission from north dakota my friend mr cramer who was in the rate regulation business say the internet it is not appropriate to regulate it as an old common carrier an old railroad system that is a monopoly because the internet is not a monopoly we want innovation for consumers we want the competition in the marketplace that we know drives down prices when you have three people in america wanting to set the rates after the fact which is what would happen in the fcc with a partisan commission as it is constructed today they get to make the call not consumers who say you know i kind of like that binge on thing that is new and innovative and the chairman will say well yeah we let that go we think that is okay that is the point the chairman got to say we think that is okay prior to title ii regulation the chairman didnt have a say in that the marketplace did the consumers could go i dont like that so i am going to that carrier some other carrier can say i dont like what theyre doing and i am going to offer you this now all that is going to get secondguessed by a government that is too big and is too much in our lives and that is only going to get more regulatory in its scope and scheme finally let me just restate the argument raised earlier that somehow consumers could be hurt by truthinbilling fraud or paid prioritization we specifically addressed those in the bill that came to the floor we listened to our colleagues we listened to those who testified we made changes in the bill we didnt do everything that everybody wanted because this is a compromise process it is a good piece of legislation that protects consumers encourages innovation and does what our constituents want us to do draw clear statutory lines that agencies have to follow not devolve all authority to them i urge passage of h r i yield back the balance of my time the acting chair all time for general debate has expired pursuant to the rule the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on energy and commerce printed in the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5minute rule and shall be considered read the text of the committee amendment in the
