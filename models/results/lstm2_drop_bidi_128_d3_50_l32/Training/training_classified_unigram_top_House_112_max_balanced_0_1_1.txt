direct impact on our nations children expanding access to highperforming charter schools has the potential to make a world of difference for students across the nation simply by adding a much needed layer of choice and competition that is good for the entire school system not just charters unlike traditional public schools the charter school model is not limited by a onesizefitsall approach instead these institutions enjoy increased freedom from state and local rules and regulations in exchange for greater accountability also the flexibility afforded to charter schools allows teachers and school administrators to adjust schedules and course work to better serve a wide range of students in their individual communities including disadvantaged students for example a louisiana charter school established in the wake of hurricane katrina enrolled many students who had fallen significantly behind other students their age after the disaster forced them to miss a full year of school despite these difficult circumstances dedicated teachers tailored groundbreaking coursework to meet the needs of these students student achievement levels soared and this charter school is now the third most successful high school in new orleans improved academic achievement in even the most troubled school districts is one reason why charter schools are in such high demand with more than 400 000 students across the nation on wait lists even so many states have imposed arbitrary caps on the total number of charter schools permitted as well as the total number of students allowed to attend these schools these provisions unnecessarily stifle parental choice and keep students trapped in lowperforming schools charter schools also have difficulty securing adequate funding current law awards funding for the establishment of new charter schools but does not support funds for replication updates or improvements as a result charter schools with a proven record of high student achievement may be unable to secure funding to replicate their educational model in a new community the empowering parents through quality charter schools act will help put an end to these barriers to charter school growth by streamlining and modernizing the federal charter schools program the law will facilitate the ability of states to access funding for the expansion and replication of the best charter schools

enough and so this young man chose to set himself afire in the middle of the town square in this tiny town in tunisia now as we all know that launched what has become known as the arab spring the economist magazine very appropriately said that one of the great developments that the arab spring has wrought is that we have now seen those socalled barbarians in the arab world in the muslim world move towards selfdetermination many people in the west and in other parts of the world very arrogantly said theres no way in the world that those people could possibly make great strides towards

million worth of projects and planning for needed safety and structural improvements of a major interchange my home state of west virginia reports that an extension would result in a 10 percent cut in programs affecting over 1 200 jobs and the state of west virginia may be forced to shut projects down or delay payments to contractors to manage cash flow new hampshire will not award contracts on 60 million in projects that were recently bid affecting 1 800 job years and will delay 115 million in bond issuance for the construction of two exits and illinois estimates that the uncertainty posed by stopgap funding measures means that 4 500 jobs could be lost and that ongoing uncertainty will increase contractor risk and cause higher bids for construction projects without congressional action on

and to express my deep and profound disapproval of the obama administrations handling of the utility mact rule let me first address what this debate is not about this is not about a debate between one side that supports clean air and another side that does not we all support and understand the importance of maintaining our pristine environment maintaining the quality of human health in the ecosystem my state the great state of utah holds some of the greatest land resources in the country some of the most beautiful landscapes they are a source of pride for all americans and especially for all utahns they provide a significant economic benefit for my state in the form of tourism dollars i would not support any legislation ever that would damage our environmental brand in utah or that would harm our environment what this debate does expose is this administrations vigorous unfettered attempts to severely limit the use of coal technology and a complete and utter disregard for the economic benefits of this industry and the economic effects of this kind of overly aggressive regulation if implemented fully the utility mact rule would give utilities nationwide 3 short years to fully complete very costly upgrades to their plants many industry experts believe that these standards are nearly impossible to meet in that timeframe utilities will need closer to 5 or 6 years to make the necessary upgrades required by this regulatory scheme those who are unable to comply will have no choice but to shut down unless or until they can meet those standards this inevitably with absolute certainty will result in sharp spikes to energy costs increased power bills for all americans affecting the most vulnerable among us the most severely higher energy costs will in turn have a direct impact on the family budget the more we as americans spend on higher energy costs the less we have available for savings for education and for other priorities although the president campaigns around the country by trying to convince americans that he knows how to create jobs this rule alone has been estimated by some industry experts as likely to kill 180 000 to 215 000 jobs by so one has to wonder why it is this administration is nonetheless imposing rules it knows cannot be met and that if they must be met will kill this many jobs and hurt this many americans why are they ignoring the obvious economic consequences of shutting down an industry that produces about half of all of the electricity we use in the united states of america today it does not make any sense we can have sensible regulations that keep our air and our water and other aspects of our environment clean we need that we want that as americans we can also have a balanced approach that considers the economic costs of new rules and restrictions on small businesses and on consumers that is what we need utility mact is an example of a regulation that does neither it accomplishes none of these interests i strongly urge my colleagues to support s j res 37 i stand with a growing bipartisan group of senators private sector unions business interests that believe we can do better as americans than imposing those kinds of regulations on the american people and who also believe it is vitally important that when we do put these kinds of regulations on the american people we first have the kind of robust debate and discussion americans have came to expect from their political institutions two separate provisions of the constitution article i section 1 and article i section 7 clearly place the legislative process the power to make rules that carry the force of generally applicable binding federal law in the hands of congress not in an executive branch agency the american people know this they understand it they expect it they rely on it because they know if we pass laws the people do not like that the people cannot accept that kill jobs that hurt those most vulnerable among us that we can be held politically accountable come election time every 2 years in the case of members of the house every 6 years in the case of members of this body when we circumvent that process when we allow the lawmaking process to be carried out entirely within an executive branch agency consisting of people who while perfectly well intentioned and well educated do not stand accountable to the people we insulate the lawmakers from those governed by those same laws this is exactly why we need to exercise our authority under the congressional review act by passing these resolutions of disapproval from time to time but it is all the more reason why we need more lasting significant reform reform that can be had through the reins act proposal this is a proposal that has already passed through the house favorably and needs to be passed in this body it is a bill that would require for any new regulation promulgated that at the administrative level any new regulation which qualifies as a major rule because it costs american consumers and small business interests individuals families and all others in america more than 100 million in a year it would take effect if and only if it were first passed into law in the house and in the senate and signed into law by the president this is how our lawmaking process is supposed to operate this is a system that our founding fathers carefully put in place assuring that those who make the laws and thereby have the capacity to affect the rights of individual americans can and will be held accountable to the people for the very laws they pass i tried to get the reins act up for consideration in connection with the ag bill we were not successful in doing that apparently some in this body some in control of this body were unwilling to have a vote on the reins act proposal as an amendment to the ag bill sooner or later we need to have a vote on the reins act we need to have this debate and discussion to assure that the laws that are passed

proud and storied history of standing up for the rights of african americans the first black members of congress served during reconstruction and they were all republicans they won their seats despite fierce threats of violence against black voters by groups like the ku klux klan and were successful only as a result of the firm support they received from the republican party one of these members was josiah t walls a slave who earned his freedom through service to the union in the civil war he settled in alachua county in our sunny state of florida and was repeatedly elected to congress atlarge in some ways i carry the torch of josiah walls you see in 1876 the democrats contested his election and had him replaced midterm with one of their own no black republican would again be elected from florida to this house until november 2 2010 when the voters of that state entrusted me to be their representative on my desk in my office there is a book called capitol men and it is a biography of those first black members of congress i stand where josiah walls and the other early black republican members of congress once stoodhiram revels of mississippi benjamin turner of alabama jefferson long of georgia robert delarge robert brown elliott and joseph rainey all of south carolina they were the ones who carried that first torch for my colleague tim scott they would have stood here urging support for policies of equal opportunity for all i stand here this evening to recognize their legacy the republican party has always been the party of freedom today we understand that our principles are best served when we act as stalwart advocates of free markets but historically republicans understood that the value of every human life is diminished when any human life is made to work against its will free markets are characterized by the free exchange of goods and servicesand by the free exchange of labor for compensation you see without free people there can be no free markets where men are not free freedom does not reign and so the republicans have always been the party of free men of individual freedom it was president abraham lincoln the father of the grand old party who signed the emancipation proclamation and brought about the freeing of the slaves for many this is the beginning and the end of the republican partys role in advancing equal rights but that understanding misses the myriad ways our party went on to better the lives of black americans and cheapens the many contributions that later generations of republicans made to the cause of freedom it was in fact republicans of their day who worked to pass the 13th the 14th and the 15th amendments securing for african americans deliverance from slavery equal protection under the law and the right to vote each of these accomplishments did its part to cement the fundamental freedoms all americans enjoy today none of them could have gotten off the ground without gop support take the 13th amendment for example at abraham lincolns request the republican national committee chairman edwin morgan made abolishing slavery an official part of the partys platform in 1864 at that years national convention he opened with a statement on the topic he said the party of which you gentlemen are the delegated and honored representatives will fall far short of accomplishing its great mission unless among its other resolves it shall declare for such an amendment of the constitution as will positively prohibit african slavery in the united states the 14th amendment was no different a little known fact about that law that granted black americans citizenship with all the rights and privileges thereof is that every vote in favor was cast by a republican and every vote against was cast by a democrat in 1968 when the democratcontrolled legislature of new jersey voted to rescind its ratification of the 14th amendment it was the states republican governor who vetoed that attempt it was the republicancontrolled 39th congress that established the buffalo soldiers a fighting force of six regiments of black american troops they would soon become known for exhibiting the courage of a cornered buffalo in battle while posted to the frontier in peacetime they gained renown for being the finest horsemen the army had to offer and in 1907 the 10th cavalry regiment of buffalo soldiers was sent to the united states military academy at west point to teach the cadets riding skills and mounted drill think about that for a second the commanders of their day were so confident in the ability of the buffalo soldiers that they entrusted them with the training of the next generation of army leaders and it was the republicans who made that happen it was the republicans who passed the 15th amendment as well for once the story is true that not every republican supported it a few abstained saying the measure did not go far enough it was the democrats who voted against the 15th amendment and when it passed anyway it was the democrats who resorted to the use of poll taxes literacy tests intimidation and other pernicious practices in an effort to keep black americans from exercising their right to vote this was something that my grandparents and my parents experienced growing up in south georgia it was a republican by the name of senator charles sumner who got the equal rights movement on its feet a fierce abolitionist and leader of the radical republicans sounds very familiar when they start talking about tea party republicanssenator sumner wrote and shepherded the first ever civil rights bill through congress it was a republican president the great general ulysses s grant who signed it into law the same day that it passed and that comprehensive bill the civil rights act of 1875 would become the blueprint for every subsequent piece of civil rights legislation to come before congress despite the fact that it was struck down by a backwardlooking court it was the republicans who first called for racial justice in the armed forces not only allowing black americans to serve their country but welcoming them to serve their country alongside their white brothers it was a republican judge named elbert tuttle who time and again ruled in favor of civil rights and who went on to order the university of mississippi to admit its first ever black college student it was a republican supreme court justice who authored the decision in brown v board of education that recognized racial segregation for what it was a violation of the united states constitution and when a school district in arkansas refused to integrate it was a republican president dwight david eisenhower who sent in the 101st airborne division to escort the little rock nine to class however it was a democrat governor in orval faubus you may recall who had tried to use his national guardsmen to prevent them from enrolling republicans were unfazed by the many democrats including john f kennedy and lyndon johnson who criticized president eisenhowers decision meanwhile it was the democrats in the senate who filibustered the first civil rights act of the 20th century and the republicans who managed to pass it nonetheless the law established a civil rights division within the justice department and authorized the attorney general to request injunctions against anyone attempting to deny a persons right to vote it was written at the behest of president eisenhower after a long drought of civil rights bills under presidents franklin delano roosevelt and president harry truman it was a senate minority leader everett dirksen a republican who helped write the first civil rights act of 1964 widely regarded as the most influential of them all and in recent years its been the republican party that has fought to prevent african americans from being trapped in a permanent underclass through dependence on government handouts in the 1990s it was the republicancontrolled 104th congress that passed the personal responsibility and work opportunity act thendemocrat president bill clinton signed it only after reluctantly having vetoed it twice this reform changed the face of welfare ensuring that recipients who were able to work would be required to seek employment no longer would government checks be seen as an entitlement no longer would states have a financial incentive to add as many names to their welfare rolls as possible finally there was an alternative to the cycle of poverty caused by years of misguided democrat policy and its been republicans who have continued to fight for the underprivileged communities even as were painted as the party of the white upper class in 2004 another republicancontrolled congress under the leadership of republican president george w bush signed an omnibus bill that included a voucher program for school children right here in the district of columbia instead of being shackled to the failed public school system thousands of students were able to use the first federal government vouchers to escape highperforming private schools what republicans have long understood is that poor communities are best served when theyre empowered to care for themselves the more they come to rely on government checks the less they learn to rely on their own ability and ingenuity our party firmly believes in the safety net we reject the idea of the safety net becoming a hammock for this reason the republican value of minimizing government dependence is particularly beneficial to the poorest among us conversely the democratic appetite for everincreasing redistributionary handouts is in fact the most insidious form of slavery remaining in the world today and does not promote economic freedom time after time the gop has stood strong as leaders on issues of conscience even when the positions weve taken have been unpopular weve held the line and ultimately brought about liberty and justice for all from eliminating slavery to securing full citizenship and voting rights for african americans to calling for desegregation even in the most hostile bastions of the deep south to implementing school choice in poor communities to helping black families break out of the cycle of welfare dependence republicans have been on the front lines of the fight for equal rights and individual manifest destiny since our partys founding under lincoln so too has the party led on issues like reducing the size of government streamlining the federal bureaucracy and returning power to the states these positions didnt always garner the most popular support at the time its easier to convince a person that a government should be doing something for them it currently isnt than to convince a person the government shouldnt be doing something for them it currently is but real visionary leaders dont retreat from fights it is said that one evening as george washington sat at his table after dinner the fire behind him flared up leading him to move his chair away so as not to end up getting burned when someone called george washington out saying a general ought to be able to stand the fire he responded that no general should ever be taking fire from behind that is the essence of integrity and convictionthe willingness to stand for what you believe at all times alone if need be without the option of retreat no matter how tough the slog ahead may be and to do so with the faith that eventually it is possible to transform a losing fight into a winning one for inspiration we need only to look to the former slave and republican frederick douglass having found his way to freedom through education and hard work he could have been forgiven for retiring from the public eye but he didnt back down from the work still to be done instead he made himself one of the most stalwart champions of not just the antislavery movement but the womens rights movement as well he wasnt content to lend his political capital to causes that would benefit him he knew what we know that injustice anywhere is an affront to the human spirit to free african americans from the bonds of slavery was only the first step for frederick douglass and he would not be satisfied until he helped liberate women from the bonds of misogyny as well in those days douglass could count on the republican party to be his ally in the fight today we remain no less dedicated to the cause of freedom so therefore with a core belief in the supremacy and the sovereignty of the individual and the unconditional dignity of every human life the republican party is always has been and forever shall be the party of equality of opportunity happy black history month i yield back the balance of my
