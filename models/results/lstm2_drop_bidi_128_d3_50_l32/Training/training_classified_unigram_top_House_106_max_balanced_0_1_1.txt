our ranking member for yielding me this time i intend to vote for this continuing resolution as i presume most of us will but let us recognize what we are doing for what it really is it is the budgetary cap stone to 6 years of the republicans perfectionist caucus i do not remember how many remember speaker gingrichs speech to the perfectionist caucus in 1998 but it was a compelling and accurate speech as to why we are here right now now my very close friend for whom i have great respect and i emphasize that because i want the public to know that in a bipartisan way i think the gentleman from florida the chairman of our committee does an excellent job and frankly had his caucus listened to him and the other appropriators as to what we should be doing we would not be here now but the perfectionist caucus moniker was born 2 years ago when then speaker gingrich walked on to this floor and chastised his republican colleagues the perfectionist caucus not all of these republican colleagues for urging the defeat of an omnibus spending measure perhaps they would do so again this year after 4 years in the majority it seems mr gingrich had finally seen the light but not before these things had happened the gop failed to pass a budget at all in 1998 the first time we had not passed a budget since the adoption of the budget act in 1974 and not before the gop dared the president to veto a disaster relief bill in 1997 to which republicans had attached controversial policy riders and not before the gop provoked two federal government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996 pleading for compromise 2 years ago mr gingrich who was pleading for compromise mr gingrich stated and i quote surely this is mr gingrichs quote in case anybody missed it surely those of us who have grown up and matured in this process understand after the last 4 years that we have to work together on the big issues if we do not work together on big issues nothing gets done so said mr gingrich the speaker of the house well now we know that common sense advice went in one ear and out the other with all due respect to the gentleman from florida chairman young who gets on the floor and says we have passed all 13 appropriations bills the gentleman is absolutely right and we knew at that time that at least 11 of those appropriation bills were not real and could not pass and wouldbring us to an impasse the gentleman knew that i do not expect him to get up on the floor and say he knew that but i know that in his heart he knew we were right today we are living with those results with only 5 days left before the start of the fiscal year in 2001 we have failed to complete our work on 11 of the 13 mustpass appropriation bills continuing res6tutions of course are not unusual since 1977 we have completed our work on all 13 spending bills on only four times in that period of time but in the 6 years under this majority we have completed our work on two or fewer appropriation bills by october 1 four separate times that is 4 out of 6 years less than two in 1995 none were completed in time not one in 1997 and 1998 we completed one bill each so my colleagues on the republican side are 100 percent ahead of where they were in 1995 and 1996 i suppose that is some sort of progress and this year we finished just two the die for this endoftheyear budget debacle was cast 6 months ago it

pretty good price it was not nearly as bad as it could have been with desert storm but we had to send our youngest and finest into harms way and it was one of the toughest votes that i have had to cast in support of president bushs move to send our troops over to the middle east everyone knew we did not go over there to put the emir back on his throne in kuwait we went over there to defend the free worlds access to oil there for a while after that i thought that congress and the administration would begin to recognize that the lack of an energy policy in the united states is a national security policy but we have gone through one more congress now and one more administration without dealing with an energy policy oh the fingerpointing has been going on but you do not solve problems with fingerpointing one of the things that i think the gentleman from mississippi and i and i believe the gentleman in the chair fits right into this mix whether it is idaho mississippi or texas my folks do not like to hear criticism of the other guy they do not like to hear democrats criticizing republicans republicans criticizing presidents unless you offer a constructive alternative unless you say im against this but heres what im for and here i believe that the reason that we are here tonight and we still have not completed our work it has been a failure of leadership of recognizing that we had or we should have passed a budget that could have restrained spending we did not agree with the presidents original call we the blue dogs did not agree with the presidents original spefiding call of 637 billion and we did not agree with the republicans call for 625 billion because we did recognize there needed to be some additional spending in the defense area in particular but in rural america in education and therefore we suggested a compromise between what the president proposed and what the majority in the congress proposed we got 138 democrats to support our budget and we got 37 republicans to support it hindsight being 20 20 i just wonder where we would be tonight had we passed the blue dog budget and had 290 votes if that was a problem but i do not see where that would have been a problem with thepresident if he had 138 democrats and all of the republicans saying lets hold spending down i doubt seriously you would have had a president saying lets spend more we will never know the answer to that that is the kind of rhetoric that everybody has fun with i want to mention one other area and this one really bothers me today that is in the area of health care the balanced budget agreement of 1997 cut the medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates way too much we have literally destroyed our small hospitals and quite a few of our large hospitals are having trouble therefore i do not choose to say just rural that happens to be my district and a lot of times communities like abilene and san angelo of 100 000 population do not consider themselves rural but for purposes of health care come a lot closer but we have reached an impasse the senate has gone home without even taking up the socalled tax cuts and or balanced budget giveback for 2001 if we should end up doing nothing we will do irreparable harm to the health care delivery system nursing homes we have i am told over 200 bankrupted today i know i have several in my district that unless we do our work and recognize that we do have to put some more money back into medicaremedicaid we have got real troubles but yet the chairman of the committee has said unequivocally we will not renegotiate that which the committee did in a purely partisan way with no input from the administration no input from our side of the aisle the same gentleman that wrote the balanced budget agreement health care provisions in 1997 is the same gentleman that tonight is saying under no circumstances will we renegotiate the health care provisions because he believes he is right well he may be right but some of the rest of us may also be right and this is where our constitution provides that you seek compromise compromise is not a fourletter word there are sincere members of congress on both sides of the aisle that would like to sit down and to reach a compromise on some of these issues and not have a confrontation but you cannot do that from the minority side of the aisle i spent the first 16 years of my life here in the congress in the majority and found myself defending myself from some of the same things that i hear my colleagues today accusing me of today bigspending liberal democrats how can this be mr speaker when you are in the minority you do not control what comes out of the congress when you control both the house and the senate it is your game plan if the president is from the other party you have got to override him to override him you have got to reach out to folks on the other side of the aisle and the current leadership of the house and i want to say this very respectfully the current leadership has chosen confrontation over compromise that had something to do with political strategy and we are sure going to find out come next tuesday what worked and what did not but in the meantime look at what we are doing we will have a new president come november 7 at least elect a presidentelect and we will have a new congress i do not know whether it is going to be a democratically controlled congress which i kind of hope for or republican but whoever is in control is really immaterial it is really immaterial somehow some way we have got to get back on track we have got to listen to the gentleman from mississippi when he points out validly that our debt is still going up my last comment at this stage is yesterday i was back home in my district and i had a group of seniors from paradise high school that came out we got into a little bit of this budget and impasse and you do not want to get too detailed because most folks eyes glaze over when we start talking about these numbers but i made the point of 4 6 trillion projected surplus and how can you spend projected surpluses when you cannot predict tomorrow and that the blue dogs have said we ought to use most of this money to pay down the debt because that is the only way you change the charts of the gentleman from mississippi where they are meaningful is by paying down the debt one young lady

something to add on and give a gift to somebody back home or some industry or some group of people they were interested in anyway what they did is they made this tremendous commitment to cut taxes and then and i think rightly so although i was not in favor of it at the time i will quite frankly tell my colleagues that they did make an increase in the expenditures for defense it was sizable over the course of that decade probably a trillion dollars for defense now looking back with the hindsight and the ability to see what happened in 1989 and 1991 the wall falling and the destruction of the soviet union as we knew it for 50 years of our lives we could say well that was the expenditure a greater defense expenditure to win the third world war without fighting it because in fact we forced in a poker game if you will the soviet union to try and match the american capacity to spend for defense they were great accomplishments fine we brought the soviet union to dissolve into new states hopefully over a period of time becoming more democratic and making the world more stable we had a military that was fully equipped to handle the needs and protect the interest of america and indeed the free world and it was accomplished but in that price it did not only cost us that trillion dollars for defense expenditures it cost us an increase from 1980 when mr reagan became president of a

has been strengthened by establishing a date certain for all countries in the program to implement such a machine readable passport some countries that have been in the program for nearly 10 years still have not introduced the machine readable passport they committed to develop as a condition of their entry into the program setting a deadline that is firm is reasonable and fair h r 3767 also
