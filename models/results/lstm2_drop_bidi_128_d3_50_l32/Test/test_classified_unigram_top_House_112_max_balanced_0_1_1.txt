the right message at a critical time for americans the senate passed a measure this past saturday that while not perfect will grant the american people the certainty they need as we head into a new year the senate amendment to h r 3630 received overwhelming bipartisan support in the senate it passed by a margin of 89 to 10 the senate version would allow employees to continue to pay a 4 2 percent tax on wages and the selfemployed would only pay 10 4 percent which represents a 2 percentage point tax cut this tax cut would provide a muchneeded boost to the economy as these tax savings could be used for investment savings accounts and for the purchase of both goods and services this kind of commercial activity is what will keep the economy moving the senate version would remove provisions in the bill that implies that would stigmatize the unemployed by implying they use illegal substances and penalizes those who must choose between paying rent or taking job training courses the senate amendment removes the onerous unemployment provisions from h r 3630 namely the provisions that would allow states to test those who apply for unemployment benefits for illegal drugs and one that would require a ged a high school diploma or attendance in a course to attain a ged prior to being able to qualify for unemployment benefits in addition the senate amendment to h r 3630 removes a 300 million on a special interest provision the provision which had passed the house would only help a handful of specialty hospitals while resulting in billions of dollars in cuts from community hospitals the senate amendment removes this poison pill in effect the senate rejected this assault on the elderly the unemployed and the middle class"], [0.0007647275924682617, 0.9992352724075317, 1, "our colleague from colorado is a persistent critic of the department of homeland security and i think often his criticisms have forcefor example his remarks a few moments ago on the unneeded socalled sanctuary cities amendment this amendment though i believe is an overreach is indiscriminate and i do feel constrained to oppose it it would reduce funding for every frontline agency within the department of homeland security by 2 percent the bill already includes a 1 percent reduction for the budget request and it reflects the third year in a row that funding for the department of homeland security has decreased i think this amendment would do damage to our security if this reduction were adopted critical programs such as border security immigration enforcement and transportation security would no longer be shielded from illadvised cuts throughout the bill the reduction would require the department to lay off crucial staff weve hired over the past 3 years including more border patrol agents cbp officers at the ports of entryand many of those ports of entry are already backed upice investigators along the southwest border and coast guardsman who work on environmental efforts such as oil spills this reduction would also mean the department would need to abandon critical research and technology procurements the science and technology program that were painstakingly building

remember how we got here if were going to figure out how to get out and how to make sure we dont get here again this has been the worst economy since the great depression and we need to make sure that the mistakes that got us here are mistakes we avoid in the future our colleagues across the aisle have said the great issue in american politics now is between those who want big government and those who want small government the real issue is which side government is on and for too long government has not been on the side of working and middle class families who are trying to make an honest living who are trying to support themselves support their families do the right thing do something useful with their lives government has been on the side of people who were trying to make a killing by getting themselves into a position where they can take advantage of the economy where they can extract money they can loot the economy is what economists called rentseeking doing nothing particularly useful but just taking a piece of other peoples productive work there has been a lot of gloating in the last little bit about how successful the financial rescue has been and by many measures it has been the banks have not actually collapsed the financial system didnt collapse we did not have a great depression as painful as this has been but the financial collapse and the rescue profoundly offended americans sense of justice and it offended my sense of justice what led to the financial collapse was not some perfect storm of unforeseeable macroeconomic forces and this weird combination of events that no one could possibly have seen it really was the result as the fcic report concluded it was not just preventable it was the result of blameworthy conduct that we should never have allowed to happen i first got involved in this issue not knowing it would result eventually in a financial crisis through working on the issue of mortgages knowing that the mortgages were terrible for consumers for homeowners and the way that they had been portrayed as a goodfaith effort by the financial system to try to make home ownership available to people who could not otherwise afford it was completely different from what was really going on with subprime mortgages there was an explosive growth of subprime mortgages they grew from 8 percent of all mortgages in 2003 to 28 percent in 2006 that is enormous growth in just 3 short years and they certainly were not about helping people buy homes who otherwise could not have afforded home ownership in fact every study that has looked at it has concluded the great majority of people who got subprime loans qualified for prime loans they got cheated they got steered into loans that obviously were not in their interest they werent about helping people into home ownership in fact subprime was almost entirely a creature of refinances seventy percent even during that 2003 to 2006 period 70 percent were refinances people already owned their homes but they needed to borrow money some of them lived beyond their means there is no doubt about it some of them were using the equity in their home as an atm machine but the fact is for the last generation the means of middle class families have not been enough americans as the economy has grown as the nation has prospered that prosperity has not been widely shared as it has been in the past and so when americans got into trouble when they needed to borrow money from somewhere when someone in the family got sick when someone lost their job when they went through a divorce when they needed to borrow money the only way they could borrow money was to borrow it against their home to refinance their home seventy percent of subprime loans were refinances and again the great majority the wall street journal estimated 55 percent most of the other estimates have been more than that were people who qualified for prime mortgages ninety percent were not fixed rate 30year mortgages they had a quick reset after just 2 or 3 years so they were 2 28s or 3 27s most people who got those loans did not even know that they did not know that the initial mortgage payment that they had to make monthly payment was going to be subject to a very quick increase and the increase after just a couple of years was generally 30 to 50 percent a month to get out of the mortgage the great great majority had to pay a prepayment penalty usually like 3 percent of the outstanding balance of the mortgage now those were not mortgages that were designed to help middle class families those were mortgages designed to take the equity in their home to strip them of the equity of their home as house prices were going up there was never any thought that they really would be able to pay off those mortgages over the course of 30 years and then invite their friends and family over to have a ceremony where they would burn their mortgages as earlier generations of americans had done they were mortgages that had the effect of trapping people in debt and taking from them the equity in their home and making sure that that ended up in the pockets of the financial sector not in the pockets of the middle class families other practices in that last decade that should never have happened overdraft fees now overdraft fees serve a useful purpose in another generation we used the criminal laws to prosecute people who wrote bad checks there are a lot of perfectly honest folks who got themselves in just a little bit of trouble or didnt balance their checkbooks who ended up with prosecutions for writing bad checks but overdraft fees became a source of profit for banks a typical overdraft fee would be 40 bucks the biggest banks actually developed what was called fee harvesting software if you had an overdraft agreement and you had one unless you specifically asked not to have one and you went to an atm machine and you asked for your balance it wouldnt actually tell how much you had in your account it would say funds available that meant how much your balance was plus what they would allow in overdraft fees and they would run the bills through in a way that would maximize your overdraft fees so if you were like a lot of people and you got to the end of the month and there was more month than there was paycheck and you went to the atm and you had a hundred bucks in your account and you went to the atm machine and you took out 20 and then you took out another 20 and then you made a 20 purchase and then another 20 purchase with your debit card and then maybe a 15 purchase and then you wrote a 100 check or a 105 check the banks would put the 105 check through first putting you over your limit charging you a 40 overdraft fee on that and the 20 the 20 the 20 the 20 and the 15 now thats just crooked and that was legal"], [0.0007773637771606445, 0.9992226362228394, 1, "i would like to thank the gentleman from maine for providing an opportunity for civility and

of the rule as well as the underlying legislation which was h r 4310 and the conference report that accompanies the defense authorization act for fiscal year 2013 i also have to at the beginning thank the chairman of the house armed services committee mr mckeon for his hard work and his steady leadership on this bill as well as the ranking member mr smith of washington for continuing the timehonored tradition of close cooperation and bipartisanship when it comes to defense and producing this conference report i also thank the professional staff which has worked closely together on literally hundreds of very difficult and often very technical issues and has done so cooperatively in an extremely responsible manner im very proud that the armed services committee produced a bill in a very bipartisan manner im proud of the floor of the house who voted and passed in a bipartisan way this bill back in may the senate has finally decided to pass the bill in december that the senate has passed a bill is commendable it is unusual but it is also commendable the fact that they have done this here gives us an opportunity of passing one of the few bills that must be done in every session of congress the senates procrastination on this effort is one of the things that is worrisome i only hope that in the years to come the senate majority leadership will return to acting expeditiously deliberately and in a more timely manner in something that is this important it is actually a testament to the competency and professionalism of the house armed services committee staff the house leadership staff and the rules committee staff that this enormous and complex conference agreement could be rescued at the end of what is becoming an otherwise contentious lameduck session in our rules committee meeting the other day we had the opportunity of having mr hastings and others refer to the constitution it is very significant that in the beginning of the constitution the preamble that we talked about creating a more perfect union a more perfect union is not a grammatical flaw that was introduced by the founding fathers it had a specific historical context it also talked about preserving or promoting domestic tranquility which had also a specific historical context which had nothing to do with america being sedate or tranquil it had something to do with the specific concept of private property it also talked about promoting general welfare even though they had a uniquely different idea of the word general than we have today but in providing in the intermediary with all these provisions is also the word that we are supposed to provide for the common defense it was not unusual that that word was in there put in by gouverneur morris and the rest of them when the founding fathers met to write our constitution they were looking at the historical milieu of the day and the concepts that were going on at that time they responded in a way to try to make sure that they solved the problems of the day in a way that would never come up again the concept of providing for the common defense became one of the core constitutional responsibilities that was extremely significant we had won the revolutionary war but we had alsoseveral of the statesviolated the treaty with britain the inability of some states to protect tory property had given the british the reason to continue to have armed british soldiers on american soil or british forts on american soil we could not under the articles of confederation control our borders the british were arming subgroups coming in here to do more than just destroy our domestic tranquility but also to take down and harm the lives of americans it seems some things never change but the articles of confederation and congress could not respond to this they had an army of only 700 people there was no navy to control the shipping or protect our shipping rights the articles of confederation and congress realized what we should also realize that if we do not have an adequate and strong defense not only can we not militarily defend this country but we dont have the ability of diplomatically trying to reach solutions to problems without resorting to military efforts they realized that this was one of the flaws of america when they wrote the constitution so it is not unusual for them to specifically put in here that one of the responsibilities that this house has is to provide for the common defense it is not unusual that in article i section 8 there are 17 clauses seven of those 17 clauses as well as the introduction talk about the necessity of military defense and military preparedness for this country they recognized how significant that was not just for defending militarily but also for the future and the diplomatic abilities of the future united states this bill deals with one of the few core constitutional responsibilities that we had fortunately over the past 51 years congress has been able to come together in an amazingly bipartisan way to come up with a defense authorization bill that provides our defense agencies the ability to function to train to equip our forces and to provide for our military personnel and their families we are betting if we do not do this that the largescale threats to our national security will be so far in the future we can just sort of tread water i hope sometimes that they are right but that treading would not be what the founding fathers would look at as providing for the common defense in a real world there would be what i would consider to be a more significant and effective bill but were not dealing with the real world we are dealing though with realworld issues part of the issue is that we are looking at a world that is extremely dangerous for uswe do not know what the future enemy will beand we are also dealing with a world in which we are continually trying to diminish our military presence our navy is smaller than it has been since 1917 our army will be smaller than it was at the beginning of world war ii our air force is the smallest it has ever been in the history of this country with the oldest planes that weve ever had those issues are issues that are significant they are important and they must be addressed and those are going to be ongoing longterm issues this particular bill does not do as much to address that particular problem and give us the security of the future as i wish it could do thats only because we are not dealing in a perfect world where we can establish the setting that we wish to do we have to deal with the setting in which we find ourselves having said that there are a lot of things in this particular conference report and in the housepassed bill which are very very positive and they do move us forward as we continue the discussion of this rule as well as the debate of the conference report on the floor we will talk about some of those things that are positive and that do move us forward with that i look forward to the continuing discussion about talking about what is indeed in this particular bill i reserve the balance of my time"],

these many years it is indeed one of the highest honors and privileges of my life to be able to represent the people of illinois 10th congressional district in this esteemed body ive always remembered who i work for and what they wanted to see accomplished and the importance of bringing thoughtful independent leadership to the congress when i first ran i saw far too many peoplefar too many americanswho were struggling and out of work in a tough economy as a small business owner i certainly understand firsthand the pressures that small business owners and family businesses are facing all across the country i felt that the federal government was making it harder and harder for me to put the key in the door and open up my business each and every day frankly they should be doing quite the opposite we here should be trying to make it easier for businesses to open up their doors easier for them to hire that next individual ive talked at length in this chamber about my main street jobs agenda with its focus on progrowth tax reform increasing exports and manufacturing access to capital for small businesses making investments in infrastructure utilizing domestic energy resources the importance of stem education and implementing smarter regulations as opposed to simply more of them i do believe that this is the best recipe for moving our country forward and for getting our economy back on track now there is certainly much more work to be done in the future but i do want to recognize two important steps that we have taken in the 112th congress this chamber has advancedand i have been proud to supporta framework for tax reform that is focused on economic growth and on providing muchneeded tax relief to american families the realization of this tax reform will be essential in helping our economy reach its full potential in the future i am also proud of the work that we have been able to do to promote domestic manufacturing exports and jobs created by them as the secondlargest manufacturing district in the nation we know how important it is to have trade agreements which we passed with colombia panama and south korea and we are already seeing the positive impact that these agreements are having today on jobs back home i would also like to take this time to highlight a number of more locally focused achievements specifically noteworthy for the people of illinois 10th congressional district for nearly 20 years weve been working closely with the local coalition of stakeholders and the army corps of engineers with the unitedstates epa and the illinois epa to try to clean up waukegan harbor and to delist it as an area of concern for lake county it is the gateway to the great lakes i am pleased to say that that cleanup has begun and that we are going to delist that that did happen under our watch and its something that a number of us are very very proud of of vital interest to every person in the 10th congressional district is our transportation system in this congress we passed a 2year transportation bill one which i can say is good and fair for our district i fought hard and yes even broke with the party when i felt that the legislation that was drafted would jeopardize our priorities and the people in the district fortunately these concerns were remedied in the final legislation and i am proud that we were able to come together in a bipartisan fashion to pass a transportation bill i also want to highlight the stock act which included some legislation that i had fought formy no pensions for felons language this provision strengthened existing federal law to ensure that taxpayers are not funding congressional pensions for lawmakers convicted of public corruption crimes as residents of illinois are all too familiar with our recent governor rod blagojevich this provision has special meaning unfortunately to the constituents of illinois yet the interests of the people of the 10th district and i would argue of our country obviously carry beyond our own borders i was proud to lead an early effort in showing a commitment of the house freshmen to make sure that foreign aid in this early budgetary crisis would not be jeopardized for our one true ally in the middle east the state of israel this included showing some support for what has now become widely known as the iron dome rocket defense system but our focus in the middle east certainly has not stopped there we have gone to great lengths in this congress to zero in on what i believe is the greatest threat we have to our own national security and that is a nuclear armed iran ive been pleased to team with representative ted deutch and senator kirk on a number of bills to confront this threat our actions have ranged from strengthening sanctions on irans energy sector to promoting human rights and democracy inside iran and much more in fact one of our most important accomplishments in this congress will have been a strong sanctions package which passed both houses this summer and which included these provisions that we authored finally i would like to highlight the ongoing work to pass a bipartisan budget agreement this is an initiative that i have been proud to advance starting with a bipartisan letter that urges the supercommittee to go bigto put everything on the tablewith a debt reduction agreement that puts literally everything that people dont want to talk about out into the open and on the table in order to try to structure a deal that will in essence put our economy on a course to fiscal solvency i certainly look forward to continuing these bipartisan efforts yet again we find ourselves today at the fiscal cliff just today i had an opportunity to sit down with erskine bowles and alan simpson and other members of the brave 38 who voted for the only bipartisan budget to come to the floor in i guess a generation i hope that we can come together and talk about something biggerbigger solutions not deals we want solutions to the problems we face because thats what the american public i believe needs governing in a democracy is not easy it requires compromise and it requires working together yet as ive often said putting people before politics and progress before partisanship is the only way that we can truly move this country forward and to have a better future"]], "top_unsure":
