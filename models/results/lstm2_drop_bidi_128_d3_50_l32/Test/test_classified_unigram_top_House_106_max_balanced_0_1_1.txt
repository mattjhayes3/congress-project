within the sixth congressional district of new jersey as a senior member of the subcommittee on fisheries conservation wildlife and oceans i have a long history of involvement in protecting preserving and enhancing the striped bass in fact i have sponsored legislation to designate the striped bass as a federal gamefish this bill would prohibit the com mercial harvesting of striped bass and reserve this resource for recreational catches only therefore ensuring a healthy sustainable rec reational fishery the recovery of the striped bass fishery since the crash of the late 1970s is a example of successful state and federal cooperation and angler support over the last two decades bythe numbers the atlantic striped bass fishery appears to be thriving and healthy but maintaining these harvests will require continued coordination and careful management the 199899 harvest data show a harvest increase for both commercial and recreational fishermen over previous years in fact harvest levels have been increasing steadily since the moratorium on striped bass fishing was lifted in 1990 in its 1999 report to congress the atlantic states marine fishery commission states that the 1999 stock assessment revealed cause for concern that striped bass were fished above the target level in 1998 and of particular concern was the finding that fishing mortality for older age 8 and up fish exceeded the definition of overfishing in 1998 these age 8 and older fish represent the most important age class for recreational fishermen and provide a large percentage of the spawning biomass while these stock assessment figures raise concerns about the harvest of larger fish the fishery does not appear to be in danger of collapse in the near future however i believe we avoid that potential threat of a collapse in the future in 1979 congress first authorized the emergency striped bass study as part of the anadromous fish conservation act to addressthe problem of declining striped bass stocks this legislation was later expanded by the atlantic striped bass conservation act of 1984 which ensured that the states would comply with a coastwide fishery management plan since its inception this bill

hoisting a machine gun or a welders torch the rosie the riveter national park would salute the role of the home front during world war ii particularly recognizing the significant changes in the lives of women and minorities that occurred during that era i am very pleased by the wide support this legislation has received not only in our home community of richmond california but from groups like kaiser permanente and the veterans of foreign wars i want to thank the gentleman from alaska and the gentleman from utah for their solid support for this legislation which will give this house an opportunity to go on record as honoring the millions of women who served in the home front during world war ii i want to thank the members of the committee on resources who voted unanimously to report this legislation to the house last month there has beena great deal of discussion about the significance of world war ii this year which marks the 55th anniversary of the end of that horrific conflict just last month the dday museum was opened in new orleans with a great deal of attention paid to the critical role in the successful invasion of the higgins boat and those who manufactured it h r 4063 allows this nation to honor permanently through the creation of a national historic park all of the millions of women and minorities in particular who were the forgotten soldiers of world war ii those who made enormous contributions to this nation during world war ii on the home front their migration to industrial centers like richmond california and their ability to move into jobs formerly held only by white males who had moved into the armed forces changed the course of the war the course of history and the course of social and economic policies in this country forever it should be noted that thousands of them gave their lives as part of the war effort i would like to note that in the report from the national park service they note that between pearl harbor in 1941 and january of 1944 that 37 000 people lost their lives on the home front working to build the military mechanism that we used to defeat the axis that over 4 million people were temporarily disabled and 210 000 people were permanently disabled so in fact the war the war that world war ii was creating was creating the casualties also on the home front for those who responded to the national need rosie the riveter has survived as the most remembered icon of the civilian workforce that helped win world war h and had a powerful resonance in the womens movement the national park service tells us in their feasibility study the national park service also found that the rosie the riveterworld war ii home front national historic park is nationally significant and that richmond offers an exceptional opportunity to interpret the many layers of world war ii home front experience including migration and resettlement for jobs integration of the workforce industrial and employee service innovations and the remarkable effort by government industry communities and unions to enable america to win the war at the hearing we held on this bill we heard from former rosies and wendy the welders through the moving testimony of ludie mitchell we heard what it was like for minority women to journey from the south to the west coast of the united states to areas that they had never been had never seen and had barely heard of to take up a welders torch to climb into the belly of a ship under construction and do their job and at one point complete the construction of that ship within 4 days we also heard from ruth powers who worked in the child care center which was necessitated by the construction schedule in the kaiser shipyards for 24hour child care in fact what we found in the discussions during the hearing was that today as we talk about the 24 and 7 economy the fact that dot coms and the new technology cause people to work around the clock with the globalization of the economy what in fact we find out that 24 and 7 existed long before that it existed in the home front battle in world war ii where we had 24hour child care 24hour food service 24hour health care movie shows ran 24hour schedules and in many instances boarding houses ran 24hour schedules because one shift would sleep while the other shift was working and then the others would come in so that there would be enough housing for all of the workers who migrated to the west coast shipyards in richmond california what this legislation is really about is about a celebration of the american spirit it is about a celebration of americans ability to sacrifice it is about a celebration of americans responding to the call of the country to the national need and responding to problems in other parts of the world because that is what america did in the home front during world war ii america responded with every being in the country to contribute to that effort as white america white male america went off to the war quickly the roosevelt administration found itself with the inability to conduct that war because america was not prepared for that war so some 10 million people went off to military service that meant that somebody else was going to have to take the jobs in the shipyards and the tank manufacturing facilities and all of the war material plants across this country that fell to rosie the riveter and to minority workers who were not allowed at that time to join the battle front they had to stay on the home front and respond they did in my hometown of richmond california a sleepy westeri town on the edge of san francisco bay it went from 23 000 people to over 90 000 people in a matter of months as henry kaiser responded to the call of president roosevelt to create the infrastructure to build the ships in the 1930s i think i am correct america launched about 30 ships in the 1940s very few until the war started in this shipyard we built over 747 ships and at one point in the historical report they tell us the robert e perry liberty ship was constructed in richmond shipyard number 2 in 4 days 15 hours and 29 minutes and it was ready to go battle overseas in 4 days 15 hours the shipyard workers constructed a liberty ship that is one of the remarkable efforts that is celebrated by this legislation and would be celebrated by the rosie the riveter park it is also celebrated as the integration of the workforce for the first time out of the south blacks and whites were forced to work together if in fact we were going to defeat our enemies in world war ii so in this case not only was the workforce becoming more female it was becoming integrated again that changed the social dynamics not only of our civilian structure where people were living in the same housing there was no time to segregate them it was too expensive people came together in integration in the workplace in child care centers and health care facilities and in housing but eventually it also changed to the integration of the armed services in responding to this but it was not just the rosie the riveters and the welders responding and sacrificing and responding to the call of president roosevelt and the needs of our nation other americans were doing the same thing those of that generation will remember the efforts to ration gasoline to ration all the critical materials any metals rubber tires bicycles vacuum cleaners all of these things had to last they had to last longer than normal because we needed the materials for the second world war i some people will remember the slogans use it all up dont waste it wear it out make it do or do without victory gardens cropped up all over the nation all part of the home front battle the effort of this legislation is to remember that and create a repository for so many of the artifacts that continue to exist to create oral histories of the women and the men and the minorities that worked in the shipyards and the home front effort a couple of years ago under the leadership of councilwoman donna powers we had a celebration in richmond california where to the best of our knowledge we tried to invite many the women who worked in the shipyards during world war h to come back and to participate in the celebration recognizing their contribution to the winning of world war ii the fact is that over 100 women came from all across the country with their daughters with their granddaughters in some cases granddaughters and daughters came because their mother or grandmother had passed on but they wanted to come see where their mother or grandmother or great grandmother worked and to participate in that piece of history hopefully the creation of this home front historic park will allow other families to participate in that historic journey on behalf of their families and the contributions that these women made to winning the war effort i would l4ope that the house would give its overwhelming support to this legislation so that we can follow up on the finding of value of this park by the national park service and we can pay proper tribute to all of those who participated in the battle for the home front i rise in support of h r 4063 which would create the rosie the riveterworld war ii home front national historic park by passing this bill today and sending it over to hopefully expeditious

rosie the riveter has survived as the most remembered icon of the civilian work force that helped win world war ii and has a powerful resonance in the womens movement this legislation has been carefully developed by local officials and organizations in the richmond and east bay area in conjunction with the national parks service pursuant to legislation enacted by the last congress the bill is based on the feasibility study prepared pursuant to that legislation i would note that assistant secretary donald barry has stated the study found that the area proposed as the rosie the riveterworld war ii home front national historic park is nationally significant richmond offers an exceptional opportunity to interpret the many layers of world war ii home front experience including migration and resettlement for jobs integration of the workforce industrial and employee service innovations and the remarkable efforts by government industry communities and unions to enable america

journey to new areas of the country to take up welders torches and climb into the belly of ships under construction building in one case a complete ship in just four days we also heard from ruth powers who worked in the child care center that was necessitated by the roundtheclock schedule of the kaiser shipyards in fact child care and group health pioneered by kaiser were among the most historic social developments to emerge from world war ii and at the rosie historic site we have original buildings from both we also have some of the remaining dry docks where the liberty and victory ships were constructed and some of the unique architecture that was transformed into war production facilities or built to accommodate defense needs the full story of the home fronts contributions and sacrifices during the war and richmonds particular contributions to that effort are outlined in the feasibility study at this point excerpts from rosie the riveter world war ii home front final feasibility study report national park service june 2000 in the first year of americas entry to world war ii the unitedstates navy was losing ships faster than they could be built in the 1930s america had launched only 23 ships in 1940 it took 14 months to build a typical cargo ship by 1945 it was being done in eight weeks four shipyards were built in rapid succession in richmond beginning in early 1941 and completed by 1942 employment at the richmond shipyards peaked at 90 000 and along with the rest of the defense industry buildup forced a national recruitment and migration of workers and integration of the work force that was unprecedented in its magnitude and impact as america went to war its people fought overseas on the battle fronts and pitched in on the home front ten million people departed the civilian workplace for active military service industry challenged to undertake a massive overnight buildup aggressively began recruiting and training an effective workforce from the population left behind rosie the riveter was a propaganda phrase coined to help recruit female civilian workers and came to symbolize a workface that was mobilized to fill the gap wendy the welder was another less glamorized icon who in real life was janet doyle a welder in the richmond shipyards after some initial resistance from employers women replaced men in many traditionally male stateside jobs to support world war ii home front production efforts as men enlisted in active military service people of color encountered more lengthy resistance but ultimately were brought in the home front workforce the four richmond shipyards built by industrialist henry j kaisers firm employed 90 000 including tens of thousands of women of all ages and backgrounds in richmond these women helped build 747 ships in record time for use by the united states navy and merchant marine their labor marked an unprecedented entry into jobs never before performed by women and played a critical role in increasing american productivity to meet the demand for ships to overturn the german and japanese strategy to defeat the unitedstates navy these four shipyards constitute the largest world war ii shipyard operation in the unitedstates richmond also had 55 other wartime support industries and one of the nations largest wartime housing programs the ford assembly plant converted from automobile to tank production during the war processing over 60 000 tanks plus a variety of other military vehicles nationwide six million women entered the world war ii home front workforce the employment opportunities for black women and other women of color were unprecedented african americans asians hispanics and native americans were eventually employed for the first time to work side by side with whites in specialized highpaying jobs previously unavailable to them women and people of color earned more money than they ever had and mastered job skills that had been solely performed by white men up to that point many of the home front industries were set up at the nexus of railroad lines and harbors where materials could be assembled and shipped overseas richmond was ideally situated as a west coast rail terminus on san francisco bay and the golden gate opening to the pacific ocean during world war ii richmonds population grew dramatically from 23 642 to over 100 000 attracting people from all over the country by 1944 27 of the richmond shipyards workforce of 90 000 were women including over 41 of all welders and 24 of all craft employees another 10 000 workers including commuters from other bay area cities and towns worked in richmonds 55 other war industries the jobs available at world war ii home front industrial complexes attracted and actively recruitedworkers from across the country resulting in massive mostly permanent population relocations many who relocated from poor rural places and marginal jobs such as sharecropping were determined to stay on after world war ii the cities where the world war ii industries mobilized were confronted with overwhelming demands on housing transportation community services shopping and infrastructure to enable the 24hour production the largest companies such as kaiser and the public sector cooperated to provide round the clock child care food service health care and employee services despite their best efforts many workers often had to settle for marginal housing long lines for purchases and lengthy commutes in addition to the other home front sacrifices working conditions on the home front could be difficult and dangerous and took a very high toll a january 21 1944 new york times article cited industrial casualties women and men between pearl harbor and january 1st of this year aggregated 37 500 killed or 7 500 more than the military dead 210 000 permanently disabled and 4 500 000 temporarily disabled or 60 times the number of military wounded and missing while the ultimate united states casualty count on the battle front reached 295 000 the additional casualties on the home front represent the full price america paid to win the war for most americans the world war i1 home front experience also involved many daytoday adjustments to support the war effort these adaptations involved collection and recycling of strategic materials such as metal paper waste fat nylon silk and rubber twenty common commodities including gasoline sugar coffee shoes butter and meat were carefully rationed tires cars bicycles vacuum cleaners waffle irons and flashlights had to last because they were no longer manufactured people were asked to use it up wear it out make it do or do without victory gardens cropped up everywhere everyone bought war bonds national parks were closed women replaced men in professional sports leagues orchestras and many other tasks as world war h drew to a close warrelated industry jobs peaked in early 1945 and began to shut down as the last battles were fought after the war jobs for women and people of color diminished dramatically postwar jobs were largely reserved for returning servicemen propaganda messages were rephrased from telling women to come to work to advise them that their appropriate roles were not at home while most assumed those who relocated to the home front industrial sites would return to where they came from the majority of migrants were determined to stay the world war ii home front in richmondwas representative of other industrial centers that emerged specifically to support americas war effort many of those who worked in richmonds industries are part of the community today the effort to preserve these historic sites has been led by the city of richmond including mayor rosemary corbin and councilman tom butt former councilwoman donna powers and local preservationists including donna graves they have generated not only plans but substantial financial resources to support the restoration and maintenance of the historic structures the national park service will play a key role in developing the site including the maintenance of a visitors center and services but the major financial responsibilities will remain with the local community i do want to pay tribute to regional director john reynolds and ray murray of the national park service who have played a key role in producing the feasibility study and in working closely with the local groups to finalize this project and develop the legislation before us today this legislation pays tribute to all those who participated

for the remaining senior citizens of bikini atoll the odyssey of the bikini people is a very sad one indeed they were moved off their atoll in march of 1946 by the unitedstates navy to facilitate the unitedstates nuclear testing program they were first moved to rongerik an uninhabited atoll some 100 miles east of bikini naval officials stated that rongerik was bigger and richer than bikini but it turned out that the move was illconceived and poorly planned contrary to the navys assertions rongeriks land area is onequarter of the size of bikini and its lifesustaining pandanus and coconut trees were considerably less productive than those of bikini the situation on rongerik steadily deteriorated over the next 2 years in july of 1947 a medical officer who visited the atoll reported that the bikinians were visibly suffering from malnutrition several sites for another relocation were explored but none proved satisfactory however when a navy physician examined the bikinians in march of 1948 and found them to be a starving people emergency measures were called for and the bikinians were immediately evacuated to the navy base at kwajalein atoll as early as 1948 as the official navy history of the trust territory notes definite physiological scars were left on the people the consequences of their two relocations 2 years on rongerik and nearly 8 months on kwajalein were already abundantly evident in less than 3 years the once selfsufficient people had been transformed into dependent wards of the united states their very existence had been threatened and the little confidence that they had in themselves was diminished the third relocation of the bikinians occurred in november of 1948 when the community was moved to kili island some 400 miles south of bikini although kili receives more rainfall than bikini and has richer soils it is an island a high island not an atoll and it is about oneninth the land area of bikini it has neither lagoon sheltered fishing ground protected anchorage nor good beaches instead a flat reef shelf forms around the circumference of the island and drops abruptly to great depths as a result it is virtually inaccessible by sea from november to may when tradewinds cause heavy surf to pound the shore this drastic change from an atoll existence with its abundant fish and islands as far as the eye could see to an isolated island with no lagoon and inaccessible marine resources took a severe physiological toll on the bikini people since their arrival there in 1948 the bikinians have compared kili to a jail the elders sorely miss the ability to move about an atoll engage in fishing expeditions across the lagoon or in the open sea and sail to other islands at bikini much of mens lives had centered about their sailing canoes and they spent many hours working together on them these sailing canoes had to be abandoned on kili and the bikinians have lost virtually all thier sailing and fishing skills today 53 years after their move from bikini less than half the elders who were moved off originally in 1946 are still alive the radiological cleanupand resettlement of bikini is at least a decade away and will cost at least several hundred million dollars and the numerous relocations of the people have had severe consequences the bikinians did not desire relocation in 1946 but they believed they had no alternative but to comply with the wishes of the united states much of the bikinians culture and society and identity are rooted in their ancestral home the islands reefs and lagoon of bikini atoll the peoples identity the very essence of their perceptions of themselves is intimately tied to their home atoll the system of land rights provided much of the underlying structure for the organization of the community short of loss of life itself the loss of their ancestral homeland represented the worst calamity imaginable for the bikini people the confinement of the bikini people to kili has deprived them of most of the activities and pleasures that they enjoy at bikini atoll the people of bikini gave the united states everything they had their land and their home they demanded nothing in return they asked only that the united states care for them until their land had served its purpose and could be returned to them the united states promised that it would do so but some 53 years later and 41 years after the last nuclear test at bikini the bikinians are still not home they lived up to their side of the deal and the people of the free world did well by them they made contributions to the victory and the cold war that many other peoples did not the tests in the marshall islands cost hundreds of billions of dollars but we never questioned their value because these nuclear tests assured unitedstates nuclear superiority over the soviet union and saved billions of dollars in defense spending as the atomic energy commission reported to congress in 1953 each of the tests involved a major expenditure of money manpower scientific effort and time nevertheless in accelerating the rate of weapons development they saved far more than their costs in an attempt to assist the people of bikini we provided funding for their resettlement trust fund in 1982 those funds have been well invested and it is only appropriate for us to support a onetime 3 percent distribution to the heads of household with the understanding that the bikini elders will be the primary beneficiaries thanks to sound investment decisions this trust fund has earned almost 14 percent annually since 1982 so a 3 percent distribution will not require an appropriation of funds by congress nor will it diminish the original corpus of the trust i want to say on a personal note that this especially goes out to the family of ralph waltz who was a peace corps volunteer on kili atoll and who was personal witness to this mr waltz has since passed away but he was a very good friend of mine and he first brought me to these issues that are

things mr lincoln was poor and struggled to educate himself he encountered numerous business setbacks and challenges a captain in the black hawk war lincoln practiced law and spent 8 years in the illinois legislature in 1836 lincoln was elected to congress and served two terms lincoln took 5 years off from politics to focus on his law practice when he returned to the political arena in 1854 he took an unpopular stance he opposed the kansas nebraska act which threatened to extend slavery to other states lincoln was elected president in 1860 when the united states was no longer united believing that cession was illegal he was prepared to use force to defend the union and did so the civil war began in 1861 and would last 4 years costing the lives of over 500 000 americans on november 16 1863 in the midst of the war on a battlefield near gettysburg pennsylvania president lincoln presented to the people his vision for our nation conceived in liberty where everyone is created equal this speech known as the gettysburg address shaped the destiny of the united states of america that government of the people and by the people should be for all people regardless of race or color or gender for this mr lincoln lbst his life in the balcony of the fords theatre in 1865 right here in washington d c the bicentennial commission will recommend to congress what activities and actions should be taken to celebrate the life of this great man the commissions recommendations to this body should reflect how a man of humble roots rose to the presidency of the united states and

the funds that were allotted in the fiscal year 2000 budget while it was the will of our committee that these funds should be dedicated to improvements in our current crop insurance program the congressional budget resolution made funds available for the broader purposes of income assistance and for risk management and in so doing provided a level of flexibility that would permit nearly any kind of agricultural assistance the bill before us today however does not recognize that flexibility in a rare moment at a time when the congressional budget actually allows us to increase the amount spent on farm programs without having to offset them the bill spends all of its money on yield insurance and ignores the many other needs facing agriculture these budgeted funds came on the heels of last years 6 billion in emergency agricultural spending even as we speak appropriators in conference are finalizing a proposal to designated over 8 billion as emergency spending to compensate for economic circumstances that were entirely foreseeable the fact that 2 years in a row we are compensating producers for low prices seems to me to be a stark admission that our basic farm program is not working just as yield disaster aid shows that crop insurance is not working increases in the budget were a clear signal by our colleagues that these problems income reductions as well as yield reductions need to be addressed our nation deserves a longterm reliable farm policy taxpayers and agricultural producers alike should be able to know up front what kind of assistance they can expect and what the rules will be for distributing it in terms of yield insurance this bill makes some progress higher subsidy rates for example will lead to higher levels of participation in crop insurance and better indemnity performance for the producers who participate absent from the bill is the other half of the picture last year our programs left producers overexposed to price and weather disasters this bill makes progress toward addressing yield disaster but what about price disaster how much more will our government spend on ad hoc supplemental amta payments before we realize that a more rational predictable policy needs to be in force i intended to offer an amendment that addresses the total revenue picture for program crops aecause the score from cbo came in at a higher level than expected i will not offer it at this time however i am committed to exploring all avenues in order to provide this type of assistance in a budgetarily responsible manner i will describe it now in

payments sip producers who planted crop would receive a payment for a crop year if national revenue for the crop falls significantly below the most recent 5year average payouts would occur if national prices are low or if a national production is low a supplemental income program can work for our producers and for taxpayers as well it is a simple program under which payments would go directly to actual producers in time of need it is the kind of longterm approach we should be using to address agricultures cyclical problems h r 2559 does increase the subsidy provided to the current revenue products that address price drops within a crop year however it does nothing to protect producers from severe downturns in income from year to year the supplemental income program would complement
