floor of the house ordinarily i very much relish the task but after the debates that occurred on the last bill that was before the house i have some trepidation about the members that argued in favor of the cuts i was delighted to see that the house sustained the actions of the committee on appropriations it is an honor and it gives me the opportunity to pay my tribute to some of the most able members of the house members who are on the subcommittee on interior of the committee on appropriations who crafted this bill and to my mind did an outstanding job the gentleman from oregon the gentleman from pennsylvania the gentleman from washington the gentleman from massachusetts the gentleman from alabama and the gentleman from mississippi the distinguished chairman of the full committee i want to pay particular tribute to the gentleman from ohio a man who i admire and respect a great person a great legislator who has made such a contribution on this bill in all honesty it could be called the regula bill the gentlemans contribution was so tremendous it is a pleasure to be associated with the gentleman and to work with the gentleman on this bill the committee on appropriations has worked its will and we bring to the floor a very good bill it is a bill that is not only technically correct but it is within the 302 b allocation it is within outlays it is within budget authority but more than that it is a responsible bill in all truth we should have had higher appropriations in order to take care of the needs of the country in order to protect the governments resources and its programs on the other hand the appropriations are not so low as to cripple them but that is all that we can say about the levels that we bring to the members in this bill appropriations for almost all of the programs have been cut over the years i do not think they can be cut very much more and still protect the interests of the american people take the 1981 interior bill for fiscal year 1981 as a reference point it was 10 8 billion the bill that we bring to the floor today is more than 1 billion less than the bill was in 1981 and we do this in the face of a 21percent increase in the consumer price index from june 30 1981 to april 30 1987 we do this in the face of the responsibilities of our agencies which are increasing there are 11 new park units which have been added in that time period and 30 new wildlife refuges recreation visitation is up 18 percent in the properties of the bureau of land management in the past year along passage of the alaska lands act in december 1980 has increased significantly our responsibilities in alaska for the fish and wildlife service alone expenses in alaska have risen from 20 3 million in 1981 to 51 2 million in 1988 for the national park service the increase is from 15 6 to 29 7 million the totals in this bill are 9 4 billion it is an increase over the amount last year as far as the total is concerned but as far as the actual operating levels are concerned there is no increase over the 1987 program a significant portion of this increase is due to mandatory pay and retirement costs of approximately 300 million which had to be recognized in addition to that we provided for continuing the fill rate of the strategic petroleum reserve at 75 000 barrels per day which requires an increase of 603 million in the appropriations the recommendation also exceeds the presidents budget estimates by 1v billion but it must be remembered that the presidents budget estimates were so erroneous that no member voted for them in the house itself in preparing this bill the committee took testimony from 75 members of congress and received written requests from 168 more these 243 requests cover 870 individual account requests the bill reflects our continuing investment in america and the american people it provides the amounts necessary to support the national heritage of all americansthe public lands the national parks the national forests and the cultural and historic preservation of the heritage that we want to pass along to our children our grandchildren and the generations to come and to continue the hope and dream that each of us has that what we pass along for our children and the coming generations will be better than what we now enjoy the bill includes 4 314 243 000 for programs for the department of the interior 1 666 847 000 for the unitedstates forest service 1 738 662 000 for programs of the department of energy and 1 721 082 000 for indian health indian education the smithsonian institution the national endowments for the arts and humanities and the other related agencies contained in the bill all of which are described in detail in the report accompanying the bill the programs represented in this bill in many ways represent an investment in america itself and those investments provide significant returns for example programs funded in this bill will generate estimated revenues of over 8 4 billion in fiscal year 1988 there are certain areas in this bill where the committee believed it important to exceed the amount requested in the presidents budget these include vital programs established to meet identified national goals such as the land acquisition programs in refuges parks national forests and public lands the committee has included an increase of 105 million over the budget for this purpose we could not agree with the administrations request for a minimal land acquisition program prices would only go higher critical habitat would be lost and private landowners would be inconvenienced the committee has recommended increases of 281 million in indian programs including construction of hospitals clinics and schools irrigation and sanitation facilities and protection and development of natural resources on reservation lands in keeping with our trust rersponsibilities to the indian people although the recommended funding for these programs in fiscal year 1988 is 126 million above the enacted level for fiscal year 1987 most of the increase is attributed to fixedcost increases for pay retirement and health care the committee has also recommended increases totaling almost 210 million over the fiscal year 1988 budget request but an increase of only 1 100 000 over the 1987 level for the unitedstates forest service in order to maintain important programs in forest research state and private forestry and recreation in the national forest system with respect to outer continental shelf leasing the bill continues a moratorium in only one areanorth atlanticgeorges bank the committee has concluded that there is a need to maintain this restriction to ensure that all resource values are provided proper consideration the congress continues to be confronted by gross inconsistencies in the energy policies of the administration the understandable response of the oil industry to lower oil prices in the past year has decreased production and exploration this has led some in the administration to forecast a reappearance of gas lines in the near future because of increasing vulnerability to imported opec oil our energy security has been reexamined both the interior and energy departments have offered suggestions the total of which is both inconsistent and unbalanced one suggestion with which we agree is continuing a strong strategic petroleum reserve program the committee has included 164 million to continue construction of capacity for the strategic petroleum reserve and also has provided an additional 476 million over the fiscal year 1988 budget request to provide a 75 000 barrel per day fill rate imports are increasing and prices are still low making this a proper time to provide these funds for our national security in the long term the only other administration response is to concentrate on opening up frontier outer continental shelf areas and the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil and gas leasing both of these areas raise valid environmental concerns but the rhetoric of administration spokesmen is that we have no alternatives to leasing and will be seen as weak and unwilling to make the sacrifices or changes necessary to protect our national interests if this is not done there are other alternatives none of which are being pursued with nearly the same vigor by the administration therefore in fossil energy and conservation research and development the committee recommends an increase of 265 million over the budget request we are providing an increase of 200 million for state conservation grants 186 513 000 of which will finance the lowincome weatherization and schools and hospitals programs these funds allow continuing these programs at the same level under the same conditions and in the same proportions as in fiscal year 1987 we have also provided 350 million over 3 years for a demonstration program for clean coal technologies to retrofit or repower existing coalburning facilities to find ways to reduce acid rain this is significantly less than sums proposed by the administration the program is aimed at providing better ways to reduce acid rain controls or not and should go ahead separate from acid rain legislation the bill contains funding for the navajo and hopi indian relocation commission in 1974 congress passed the relocation act in an attempt to resolve the centuriesold dispute between the navajo and hopi tribes at the time this legislation was adopted it was represented that only 1 100 families needed to be relocated at an estimated cost of 41 million to date more than 150 million has been appropriated with about 1 400 certified eligible families still awaiting relocation in retrospect 13 years later it has become obvious that the magnitude of this problem is much greater than originally estimated and that congress must reexamine this issue in a comprehensive rather than a piecemeal fashion there is no forced eviction in this relocation program only those who have voluntarily applied to the relocation commission and are certified eligible for relocation are presently being moved the funding in this bill enables the commission to go forward with housing people who have been uprooted many of whom are living in adverse conditions a recent survey of those families who have voluntarily left the land in compliance with the law reveals that 35 percent have no indoor plumbing 36 percent have no electricity and 40 percent have to haul water although this may not differ greatly from other residents of the navajo reservation the government has an obligation to provide decent safe and sanitary housing to these families the committee has taken an additional step to ensure that the rights of the retocatees are protected by including the language carried in the fiscal year 1986 continuing resolution which states that none of the funds appropriated in this or any other act may be used for eviction of individuals until a replacement or new relocation home has to the treasury i want to commend the sub house report 100171 explains the commitbeen provided committee members for their

important provision related to the california coastal commission that provision requires the secretary of commerce to release the administrative portion of the states fiscal year 1987 coastal zone management grant and prohibits the department from using any funds in the bill to initiate withdrawal of approval proceedings against the state coastal management program before february 1 1988 this is an extremely important provision the department has withheld most of the portion of the fiscal year 1987 coastal zone grant which goes directly to the commission despite the fact that we are already well into fiscal year 1988 and despite the fact that the department actually approved the states fiscal year 1987 grant application on september 30 1987 without these funds the state has been forced to cut back many critical administrative functions the departments action has no basis in law and equally importantly it flouts the will of congress in establishing a system of coastal zone management grants and in providing annual appropriations for such grants by directing the department to release the states administrative funds the provision accepted by the conferees ensures that congressional intent will be honored and that the intergrity of the appropriations process will be preserved since the release of the departments evaluation of the california coastal plan and of a set of proposed grant conditions on november 23 1987 the coastal commission and the department have engaged in a series of lengthy negotiations over the terms of both the administrative portion of the states grant and the significant improvement portion of the grant last week the coastal commission notified the department that full agreement had been reached on the administrative conditions proposed on november 23 and i understand that agreement with respect to two additional administrative grant conditions which the department proposed on december 15 1987 has also been reached it is my expectation that pursuant to the language in the continuing resolution the department will immediately release to the coastal commission its fiscal year 1987 administrative funds it is also my expectation that the department will not seek to impose conditions on the use of those funds to which the parties have not previously agreed it is further my expectation that the department will not link release of the administrative grant to agreement on significant improvement grant conditions release of these funds under the terms which i have described will allow the commission to continue its important responsibilities under the coastal zone management act again i commend the conferees for agreeing to include this provision in the continuing resolution i am further pleased that this continuing resolution for fiscal year 1988 contains provisions representing a compromise between the immigration and naturalization service and the congress on a number of important issues involving the special agricultural worker program i want to express my thanks to ins commissioner alan nelson for his cooperation and assistance on these issues because of his willingness to consider our concerns and agree on certain policies i believe the saw program can continue on the positive course it has followed since its enactment the saw program was established in the immigration reform and control act of 1986 to provide a legalization program for aliens who have worked in unitedstates agriculture its goals were to ensure an adequate supply of laborers for this critical sector of the american economy and to protect the rights of those who have worked in agriculture the program provides that aliens who can present evidence that they have worked in unitedstates agriculture for at least 90 days can obtain legal status under the new immigration law the agreements reached in this continuing resolution represent another step in a long process of negotiation between the ins and congress on how the saw program should be implemented last spring reports of agricultural worker shortages in oregon and washington raised deep concerns about the ins interpretation of the immigration law representatives from those states the three authors of the saw program myself representative howard berman and representative chuck schumer and other interested members metwith the commissioner of the ins and representatives of the state and labor departments to explore ways to improve the performance of the service in terms of processing saw applications we focused on three primary areas where improvements were needed first we asserted that the ins policy of requiring a full saw application before entry into the united states and work authorization was granted was directly contrary to the clear intent of the immigration law furthermore congressional negotiators questioned how a saw applicant could collect evidence that he or she worked in unitedstates agriculture without physically entering the united states second we felt strongly that the law did not support the ins policy of deporting any potential saw applicant who could not prove he had been in the united states since before may 1 1987 this practice presented a serious obstacle to many qualified saw applicants third the ins policy at that time was to accept saw applications only at the unitedstates embassy in mexico city this posed enormous inconveniences to potential applicants who lived some distance from the capital after negotiations with the commissioner of the ins alan nelson it was agreed that the service acept less than a full application before granting entry into the united states and work authorization papers second the service agreed to open three new application processing offices one in hermosillo one in monterrey and one on the united statesmexico border at calexico third the service pledged to move the date before which an alien had to be in the united states to file a saw application to june 26 1987 finally the service agreed to expand its public information campaign on the new law and to work more closely with groups known as qualified designated entities helping those applying for saw status these three changes set the stage for what was an extremely successful saw program last summer more than x thousand applications were received by the ins and there were no significant agricultural worker shortages in california during the 1987 harvesting season however early this past fall the ins announced that it would abandon key policies they had worked out with congressional negotiators in the spring of 1987 specifically the ins set a november 1 date for returning to its policy of only accepting full saw applications at its mexico locations this threatened to cause the same problems we had discussed in our spring negotiating sessions any new saw workers coming north this winter in the spring and summer of 1988 would find it difficult if not impossible to file a full saw application in mexico without first having access to employment records in the united states which support the application the authors of the saw program continued to feel strongly that this policy was contrary to the clear language of the immigration reform bill and additional provisions placed in the july 1987 supplemental appropriations bill also we pointed out that ins concerns that the procedure would cause mass movements towards the united statesmexico border processing site and of fraud in the process never materialized finally we felt that changing the procedure in midstream would add more confusion in a program which has been hurt by misinformation and misunderstanding the ins position was in short a giant step backwards for the saw program after negotiations this fall the ins agreed to return to the more enlightened policies of last summer therse agreements are reflected in language contained in title of the continuing resolution conference report we are considering here today first the ins will admit into the united states and grant work authorization to aliens who present a preliminary saw application to an ins border office admission under this policy will be restricted to three designated ports of entry along the united statesmexico border second while the ins will be allowed to deport apprehended aliens along the border agency personnel are required to advise such aliens of the procedures for legal admission through a designated port of entry the ins is also required to allow saweligible apprehended aliens inside the united states an opportunity to file a complete application for saw status a stay of deportation is provided for all aliens who have filed a nonfrivolous application for saw status third the june 26 1987 entry date after which saweligible aliens are unable to apply for saw status in the united states is eliminated eligible aliens will now be able to apply in the united states no matter when they entered this country fourth the continuing resolution describes what constitutes a preliminary saw application basically an 1700 form with specific attestations concerning work in seasonal agricultural crops is required supporting documents are not required there is also an understanding that these policies will be followed throughout the saw application period which ends december 1 1988 fifth in the conference report language it is suggested that the ins issue a formal policy statement clarifying its position with respect to the obligations of employers of seasonal agricultural workers during the saw application period the conferees suggest that the statement should indicate that the ins will not seek penalties from employers of undocumented seasonal agricultural workers or for the failure to complete the 19 form for such workers prior to november 30 1988 the statement should also indicate that the ins will not seek retroactive liability for such acts occurring during the application period the conferees have strongly encouraged employers to comply with the intent of the new immigration law that employers complete the 19 process this could be a useful method to determine whether job applicants are saweligible and to encourage them to apply for legal status i believe these policies in the continuing resolution fulfill the original intent of the immigration reform and control act and set a positive framework for implementation of the special agricultural worker program during the remaining months of the application period much hard work remains for those groups including the qualified designated enti ties assisting aliens with their saw applications also the spirit with which the ins follows the policies agreed to in the continuing resolution and their level of cooperation with those groups working to prepare applications will be critical to the success of the program on a related matter i want to express my disappointment that the conferees were not able to agree to a house provision prohibiting deportation of a spouse or children of any person who qualifies for amnesty or saw status it is cruel policy which threatens to separate families even after a father or mother qualifies for legal status yet currently thousands of people who qualify for legalization have this threat hanging over their head my hope is that we can act quickly in the new year to make badly needed changes in this area of the new immigration law finally i would like to thank commissioner nelson and his staff for their help and cooperation on these issues i also want to express my deep gratitude to representative neal smith chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on commerce justice state and judiciary for his assistance representative vic fazio of the appropriations committee also deserves tremendous credit for his help in making this compromise part of the continuing resolution i hope all parties can continue the spirit of cooperation represented by the provisions in the legislation we are passing here today and i look forward to working with the ins during 1988 as we continue our effort to achieve the goals of the special agricultural worker program"], [0.0010016560554504395, 0.9989983439445496, 1, "i ask unanimous consent that the committee on post office and civil service be discharged from further consideration of

evolved into an impressive collection of historical representations honoring people and events which have helped to make this country strong and unique these programs have become quite popular and profitable commemorative coins honoring the 250th anniversary of the birth of george washington the centennial of the statue of liberty the 1984 and 1988 olym pics and the bicentennial of the constitution have been produced judging by the popularity of these coins these programs are an appropriate way to symbolize american culture and to commemorate that which has made our country a world power and a living exam pie of democratic principles those in favor of design changes might well consider the substantial advantage of flexibility in commemorative coinage over changing designs on circulating coins new commemoratives may be produced as events arise which merit this honor commemorative coins should be timely reflections of significant events in our history in reaction to the excesses of the 1930s congress and the president repeatedly refused to issue further commemorative coins with none at all issued between 1954 and 1982 as chairman of the coinage subcommittee i feel a deep sense of responsibility to ensure that the nation does not again begin to slip down the road toward a proliferation of commemorative issues resulting in a termination of all commemorative coins for this reason i generally oppose the issuing of more than one commemorative coin per year since the resumption of commemorative coinage in 1982 this honor has been bestowed on a relatively small number of significant events which are of the greatest importance to the nation as these events arise congress may authorize these coins if it feels that public sentiment is strong enough to ensure the sale of the coins though such occasions are certainly woithy of the special attention that appearances on coins provides it would be illogical to represent these events on circulating currency as the design would have to change once the anniversary passed these important events should be honorably commemorated through our existing program rather than through the more costly and confusing

families met together in their homes for prayer or sunday afternoons later that year priests from nearby saginaw valley began making occasional visits to mount pleasant in 1872 three acres in southwest mount pleasant were donated to the detroit diocese for the purpose of constructii ig a church by 1875 enough money had been raised for actual construction and work soon commenced in 1879 the

elaborate national canal and riverbased transportation system which provided the infrastructure for supplying our developing nation with the coal that fueled its factories and heated its homes the proposed delaware and lehigh national heritage corridor is that treasure in the lehigh valley the corridor rooted in the lehigh canal and the lehigh river weaves its way through the region like a thread joining the fabric of adjacent communities this corridor beyond even its vast historical significance allows us to finally bring a regional focus to the lehigh river and its surroundings 4he corridor will allow us to rdinate the many parties interested in furthering our no 1 natural resource several years ago i brought together a group of public officials and private citizens from county executives to shad fisherman from history buffs to business people from bankers to boaters we sought to develop a focus an agenda and a plan for bringing the lehigh river back to its days of glory we sought to help this beautiful natural resource to once again live up to its potential an appropriate 1980s version of the halycon days when the river and the canal were king those efforts can serve as the groundwork for future action i am happy to say that the proposed delaware and lehigh navigation canalnational heritage corridor gives the citizens of the lehigh valley that common ground in an era of rapid growth and changes the corridor will allow us to build bridges between the various governmental entitiesthe counties the municipalities the boroughs and the townships along the length and breadth of the river cooperation on issues which involve the canal and river offers unique opportunities to citizens of the lehigh valley to boost regionalism and proactively build the kind of community we want the canal the lehigh river the corridor can serve as a unifying force bringing our communities together not only over historic preservation but recreation conservation sportsmans activities creative economic and residential development the environment and tourism this corridor and the regional approach it entails have the distinct potential for enhancing the quality of life in the lehigh valley approximately 375 historic and archaeological sites exist within the total corridor and symbolize in physical form tile naturally formed ecosystems of the area creating the backbone

in 1834 provided an early and essential link in a 4 000 mile national transportation route and helped to transform pennsylvania from an agrarian region to the center of an industrialized society in 1855 the peak year for the transportation of goods by canal 1 276 000 tons of coal moved down the lehigh canal to easton and the delaware canal which supported the lehigh canal carried 755 000 tons of coal much of that coal went to firing the furnaces of the nations emerging steel industrywhat later became the bethlehem steel corp the lehigh and delaware canal served as the primary means for transporting coal and other bulk goods from the anthracite region of pennsylvania to new york new jersey philadelphia and other industrial centers as far away as europe the route of the delaware and lehigh navigation canal parallels stagecoach routes and the trails of the lennilenape indians and passes numerous 18th 19th and 20th century sites of national and state historical significance the

a76 studies in my district i have four military installationsall of which have experienced problems with contracting out let me give you just a few of the problems ive seen first contracting out causes serious morale problems two years ago at dugway proving ground base support functions were contracted out to a private contractor for those employees who elected to hire on with the contractor they lost their severance pay for those employees who elected to accept employment elsewhere on base they were required to train contract workers for the very same job they had been doing for years my telephones were ringing off the hook by civilian workers who resented training contractors for the work they should have been doing second the government often must accept bids from contractors that are only paper entries with no track record at tooele army depot for example tooele had to eat costs when a private contractor failed to comply with a contract to overhaul heavy equipment for the army for 3 years the equipment was stored at tooele while the contractor attempted to renegotiate a new contract when that failed tooeles added costs included storage of the equipment maintenance of the equipment and then shipping costs to move the equipment to another army installation that finally overhauled the equipment third the purpose of a76 is to save money these are noble words but in reality the cost comparisons do not provide an equitable or true picture a76 studies are weighed heavily in favor of the contractor let me explain inhouse studies must include overhead costs when submitting cost studies but trhe same is not required of contraetors there are added costs when a governm nt employee is forced into early retirement while at the same time the government is paying the contractor to perform the lame work this added expense should be considered but is not one of the major complaints i have received from military management is that they have ito problem competing with industry as long as the competition is fair 1 agree fourth management loses control of work that must be performed on his base if the contract is not specific down to crossing every t and dotting every ii a contractor is not required to perform certain functions that a federal employee would just naturally accept for example at dugway proving ground it was the responsibility of the contractor to keep the roads plowed during winter however the base commander learned that two roads were not specified on the contract and thte ontractor informed the commander that he would not remove snow from these two roads unless the commander renegotiated the contract upward of course well snow doesnt melt very fast in utah and the roads couldnt wait for the contractor so the base commander ended up pulling some of his federal workers off their regular job to do the work that the contractor was paid to do a76 as it is not written raises serious question as to who is directing the national defense and who is in control of decisionmaking of the defense department during peacetime the snow removal incident was not critical but in time of war a base commander must have control of every function under his command rather than increasing contracting out under a76 congress should give the omb the private sector and management an opportunity to consider the contracting out process in its entirety in the meantime congress should encourage management to sharpen their pencils to achieve a 20percent cost reduction goal"], [0.003979921340942383, 0.5039799213409424, 0, "i yield myself such time as i

want to hobble ourselves why do we want to put ourselves in shackles and prohibit the development of a comparable system that might induce the soviets to negotiate asat arms control more seriously the gentleman from pennsylvania points out that if we acquire an asat capability we can put their satellites at risk and will therefore escalate an asat arms race the fact is our satellites are at risk right now the soviets already have an asat capability we do not their satellites are not at risk if you examine them all of these arguments against a unitedstates asat fall of their own weight they have the capability we do not congress has by action on this very floor denied the united states the capability of moving forward with the research development and testing of an asat i think this is very shortsighted and certainly not in the national interest the moratorium referred to earlier was described as being accepted by the administration they had no choice but to accept it other than to veto the entire defense authorization bill that was the choice i would say that if we keep burdening this bill with policy issues like arms control central america and now asat i am fearful that our committees months of work will be for naught because the bill will be vetoed"]]}
