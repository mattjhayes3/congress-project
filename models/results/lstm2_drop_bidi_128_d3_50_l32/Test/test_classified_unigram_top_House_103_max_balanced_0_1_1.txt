contained inthe billreport both the administration and congress continue to reduce the intelligence budget based on the misguided notion that the end of the cold war dictates drastic cutbacks in our national intelligence capabilities this policy flies in the face of the reality that from an intelligence perspective todays multipolar world is infinitely more complex and challenging than the bipolar world of yesterday further as the technology of warfare continues to advance todays battlefield has become increasingly dependent on timely accurate and usable intelligence to guide precision weapon systems and make tactical judgments this battlefield revolution dictates a need for national and tactical intelligence systems able to properly support our military forces of the future i fear

strong opposition to the amendment filed by mr conyers dealing with the establishment of statutory inspector generals for the national security agency and the defense intelligence agency i similarly oppose the underlying provisionalready in section 601 of the bill when the armed services committee received h r 4299 under sequential referral we looked closely at this issue and agreed with the intelligence committee that valid and legitimate issues exist with the adequacy of ig oversight coverage for dia and nsa however we disagree with the prescribed solution as component agencies of the department of defense the dia and nsa already have an igthe dod ig the dod inspector general is statutorily responsible for carrying out the ig function throighout the entirety of the department to include dia and nsa while many defense agencies as well as the military services have their own ig offices the ultimate responsibility for this critical function remains with the dod ig who has the necessary expertise statutory independence and investigative resources for the job section 601 of the bill and the conyers amendment would directly undermine this arrangement by balkanizing the ig function within dod into separate fiefdoms this year its dia and nsa next year its cio and nro or somebody else once you breach the organizational logic behind making the dod ig universally responsible for departmentwide oversight there is no real ra1tional basis for stopping with just these two agencies i strongly oppose these provisions as they will inevitably lead to a decrease in the

of the federal reserve is the federal open market committee it is here since about 1923 the federal reserve act of 1913 certainly did not provide for that but a lot of things have happened since the enactment of that law and the creation of the federal reserve board today we would think that the federal reserve board was sent from heaven with no responsibility to anybody but one thing for sure not to be accountable either to congress or the president the federal open market committee open market does not mean it is an open committee it is closed doors absolutely strict secrecy of course it has the allpowerful determination of what your standard of living is or is goingto be or is currently being determined and has been for some couple of decades and that is certainly too the advantage of the traditional american standard of living that we have always boasted of it is the one that determines the fate of an administration members may think as some citizens have written very learned and experienced corporate heads who themselves have been involved in very very effective and iongreaching financial transactions both nationally and internationally and they keep calling and writing and saying but we always assumed that the congress would be there and would not have relinquished its total oversight jurisdiction and vested this socalled board with such powers for many many years past and more recently on several repeated occasions i have given my colleagues the intricacies of what is the federal reserve board it is not a government body it is a creature of the private commercial banking system i have gone into that before so i will not repeat it it simply amazes me how many of my colleagues and how many citizens of great position seem to be surprised that actually there is no accountability it can determine the fate of an administration simply by such thingsas interest rates it is very interesting to me i have been on the committee on banking fineance and urban affairs which used to be known as the committee on banking and currency and since 1975 has been known as the committee on banking finance and urban affairs since i came to the congress 321 2 years ago up ur just relatively recently no more than 8 years every federal reserve board chairman that would appear before the committee would say that they had nothing to do with controlling interest rates that those things were the result of and they consistently repeated it the profligacy o congress and the market socalled now they not only admit it they brag about it the truth of the matter is as i have pointed out in a brief hearing before the committee to the immediate predecessor chairman of the federal reserve board paul volkmer i asked him isnt it a fact that today we no longer can control those forces that are now external to our shore that actually no matter what we do domestically will determine such things as interest rates 1210 and he acceded to the point so even though they boast today openly all those years they refused to accept that responsibility but they can determine the fateof an administration by simply determining what it is they will pay that is the bankers because the federal reserve board is private it is acorporation the congress does not have any stock in it the president does not have any stock in it the stock is owned by the commercial banks and the members of the federal reserve board system they can determine the price of treasuries and thereby in effect have such rippling effects as interest rates and determine the fate of an administration actually this has happened it happened in 1972 it happened again in 1980 when the prime interest rate went to the incredible rate of 21 percent all history as i have said repeatedly shows that thereis not one society that has survived usury se may 16 1994 and if 21 percent prime interest rate is not usury or an extortionate interest rate then i do not know what the defi1 nition of usury is this forceful buy mysterious body known as the federal open market committee recently established a formal trilateral facility with two foreign governments that involves granting foreign loans and lines of credit the constitution says that only the congress can do that not even the president only the congress that is what is wrong with this socalled trilateral setup and what is wrong is the funds have never been appropriated nor authorized by the unitedstates congress this is where so many of these corporate heads just in the last 10 days have communicated their shock they were not award of that how many of my colleagues think that there are interest rate controls or usury laws on the national level we have not had any since the national currency act of 1865 which incidentally was foremost in abraham lin colns mind when he was shot he knew what was coming but can my colleagues imagine any of my predecessors at the beginning of my career the chairman then thinking that interest rates would even reach prime interest rates over 7 percent much less 20 percent and 21 percent why they would have and i am sure they have turned over in their grave 50 times but not today the truth of the matter is my colleagues as optimistic as i am inher ently i think the time is long gone where through the ordinary course of events the congress is going to regain power power as frederick douglass said never yields except on demand it never has and it never will do we think these vast financial and banking and corporate oligarchs and plutocrats are going to yield this tremendous power of determining the fate of the fi nancial and economic wellbeing of a whole country why of course not we can forget about it not willingly is the congress going to rise i hope i always pray five of the members of this federal open market committee who discussed and voted to authorize these lines of credit and permanent loan facilities to foreign countries have never been confirmed by the senate and therefore are not constitutional officers even if by strict legal defini tion such were the case they were selected by the directors of the federal reserve banks twothirds of whom are elected by private commercial bankers and there is and always hasbeen serious doubt about the feds unilateral claim to the power to make these deals i have voiced that since we first heard of such things as swaps on april 26 the federal reserve joined with the treasury department to es tablish a permanent trilateral foreign exchange what they will call swap fa cility with the governments of mexico and canada this international loan facility should be of the utmost importance to unitedstates taxpayers whose taxes have been and continue to be placed at risk by these foreign exchange interventions foreign loans and lines of credit to foreign countries who determines what country these gentlemen who account to nobody except their own interest it is important to understand just what this recent 6 billion swap facility for mexico entails for which the fed pledges of that amount the feds part even through they announced their 6 billion guarantee several weeks ago they have actually under this agreement pledged 3 billion to benefit mexico however if the mexican government wanted 6 billion in united states currency tomorrow and went into the market to buy united states dollars with pesos the price of pesos would fall and it is unlikely they could make the trade at current exchange rates a guarantee of the transfer at any time at current exchange rates is a guarantee of a substantial subsidy to the mexican government when activated the 6 billion swap formally transfers this subsidy to mexico a week ago i brought on my colleagues now here it is this use i say illegal and unconstitutional of taxpayers money could be so easily found in the range of billions yet just 3 years ago that great historic state of rhode island was facing bankruptcy and the banks were closed and the credit unions were closed and the savings and loans were closed and we had a hearing in may of 1991 and we had a thousand of these rhode islanders elderly there had been an increase of almost 50 percent in the relief rolls because most of the elderly had their pension resources which is what was keeping them tied up the great sovereign state of rhode island only needed a line of credit so that it could issue bonds i tried to get the fed and they have the power to do it did they do it why they would not even discuss it i tried to get the other entities the fdic and the like and not a word so we had to come back and on june 28 in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs to the glory of each member we passed out a line of credit guarantee program so that rhode island could pledge its revenues from the sales tax to guarantee the issuance of the bonds and pay back or never have to use that guarantee from the government but we had to doit when it did not require legislation it could have ibeen doneby these same powerful oligarchic entitles that find it easy to provide billions for foreign governments but not for one of our own sovereign states my colleagues i think that is not only shameful i think it is criminal and it is a direct challenge to use who have been electedby the people to tepresent their interest not the bankers but their interest for us not to rise as one and protest and correct and reform and handle it in the way the constitution says it should be done in truth the socalled guarantee is a loan of united states dollars to mexico collateralized by pesos there is no denying thatgiving unitedstates dollars to a foreign government with conditions for repayment is simply a loan for unitedstates dollars in a may 9 1994 letter i received from the federal reserve chairman alan greenspan he asserted there is no exchangerate risk since the loan is scheduled to be repaid at the initial exchange rate and interest can be earned on foreign currencies held however default risk the probability of failure to repay is not eliminated a guarantee of a line of credit such as the 3 billion rate now available to mexico places united states taxpayers funds at risk in the event of default that is why i am asking the federal reserve to provide full details of all its foreigncurrency operations including completed federal open market committee transcripts where these important international currency arrangements are discussed these transcripts have not been available in fact when we had that historic meeting last october and had all the presidents and governors they attempted to deceive the committee and thereby the congress and we discovered that they had been keeping these transcripts but do they want to make them available to the representatives of the people absolutely not and that is something that i have discussed at great length before so i will not extend it now one of the most important objectives of the legislation i have introduced known as h r 28 the federal reserve system accountability act of 1993 is to increase the federal reserves accountability to the public knowing how individual members of the fomc decide on different issues serves to improve the public trust and enhances the ability of the federal reserve to carry out appropriate monetary policy i congratulate chairman greenspan and his colleagues on the federal open market committee for taking the important step of properly releasing recent monetary policy decisions just recently and again under pressure now if the fed would only take the next step of making complete transcripts of its eighth annual fomc meetings promptly available to the public people can know when and why the federal reserve is using taxpayers money for foreignexchange intervention foreign loans and lines of credit to foreign countries at least that much we will be able to hear the discussion why what were the reasons what were the members who had different ideas and how many of them spoke up i think that is important for us to know not that it changes the basic responsibility of this power to lend falling within the constitutional mandated authorization and appropriation processes now my colleagues you may not realize this but the congress never gave the federal reserve approval to establish what has today become a 30 billion swap fund this amount that the fed has amounts to 30 1 billion why that amount of money would take care of all of our housing programs that we have not been able to fund and appropriate for just that amount but this is their reserve for foreign countries which ones depends we do not know expect now and then like when they released the 6 billion arrangement with mexico or at least the line ofcredit chairman greenspans response to my letter on may 9 raises even further doubts about the legality of the federal reserves use of these appropriated funds that are used to make loans to foreign governments and to extend to them lines of credit the federal reserves periodic forays into foreign policy by way of its swap fund is certainly an issue that should be of immense concern to the congress the federal reserve began its foreigncurrency operations in 1962 and ever since then now 1962 was president kennedy and i was abroad here and i raised my voice then of course i was relatively a freshman and you certainly were supposed to be seen and not heard even at that time but i always have spoken out this was done without congressional authorization william mcchesney martin who was the chairman of the federal reserve at that time did not want to formally ask the congress for authorization because he said the federal reserve did not know what it needed and i am going to quote the congress probably would not want to put itself in the position of approving something if the federal reserve was not clear about its wishes in the matter that is reflected in the minutes of the fomc the federal open market committee of february 13 1992 chairman martin notified the congress of the federal reserves intention to establish the swap fund but he did this not openly but by burying it in a ninepage speech he gave january 30 1962 to the joint economic committee he mentioned in his testimony that the federal reserve bank of new york acting as an agent for the treasury had used the treasurys exchange stabilization fund the fund on which the federal reserves swap fund is based for operations not previously undertaken since world war ii with the aim of defending the dollar from speculative forays i think i was the only one in the congress that mentioned that there was such a thing as speculation but in 1962 in the 1960s in fact who much thought that that big tide after the war period of wellbeing would ever end and that america was the richest country in the world and the only one even then we were unaffected with that virus and nobody paid much attention it was certainly no concern but there were two things that happened that were clear signals right after 1960 the trade account for the first time showed a deficit of 10 billion i spoke out and said the reason for that was simple there were tremendous watershed periods of change since 1950 and i gave some statistics then i said in 1950 the late 1940s and 1950 the united states truly was producing almost 80 percent of the worlds needs but by 1960 it was not even 40 percent and today it is not even 19 percent so naturally sooner or later i said then things are going to have to happen for us to foresee plan ahead and see how we can anticipate these forces that willeventually turn us around also the emergence in the 1960s of the megacorporate international or translational institutions i spoke out on the record it is not what i am saying now of course at that time nobody used special orders on the floor you could write them out submit them for the record and they would be printed as if you had uttered them i never thought that was the intent of what got to be called specials orders but which is not the technical word for it i came to the floor made the speech and it is in the record i pointed out that the united states by necessity since there were nations arising in europe and asia that would soon supplant and compete with the united statesbut that is history but i am giving you this part of the history as to the genesis or the beginning of this socalled swap now it is interesting but at that time the chairman of the federal reserve board realized what the law says why that first chapter of the first section of the federal reserve act of 1913 says the federal reserve shall be the fiscal agent of the unitedstates treasury now at that time and until again the 1960s in fact president kennedy during his brief but inspiring period restored and therefore you could in 1961 1962 1963 you could dig into your pockets and if you took out five 1 notes the chances are at least two of those were unitedstates treasury notes today you look at your 1 bill 5 s10 20 and it says federal reserve notes meaning the federal reserve is the one that is printing our money that is the commercial bankers not the unitedstates government so 16 and behold as the law says the federal reserve shall be the fiscal agent of the treasury and it is now the treasurys fiscal agent or just agent or the handmaiden of the federal reserve board but it is interesting that in 1962 chairman martin said well we are going to act as the agent for treasury which has the socalled stabilization of swap fund at that time thencongressman richard bolling of missouri asked chairman martin to explain what because congressman bolling was on the joint economic committee chairman martin replied this way and i quote i want to make clear mr bolling that the federal reserve is not anxious to engage in this type of activity the treasury stabilization fund has experimented with this kind of operation since march of this year in a very small way and we have come to the view that however we should require these currencies and it is not possible to spell out here what we are aiming at is to keep the speculators from unseating us that was the joint economic hearing of 1962 pages 181 and 182 chairman greenspan has attached to his may 9 1994 letters a document prepared by the federal reserve general counsel who at that time was howard hackley this document dated november 2 1962 is entitled legal aspects of proposed plan for federal reserve operations and federal currencies it states with respect to the federal reserves proposed swap fund and i am going to quote this matter is admittedly subject to a question and while it is unlikely that the plan would be challenged in court there can be no assurance in the absence of legislation and i repeat in the absence of legislation that it would not be criticized from some sources on legal grounds the general counsel goes on to say consultation with banking and currency committees admittedly the question is debatable particularly in view of the 19331934 position of the board moreover it may be noted that in 1932 senator carter glass had criticized certain foreign operations of the federal reserve bank of new york which might be considered similar to those now contemplated as being contrary to law senator glass suggested that such operations were inconsistent with the federal reserve act and i say certainly with respect to the constitution the general counsel of the federal reserve said in view of the uncertainties as to the construction of the law and the history of this matter it might be desirable before instituting the plan now proposed to inform the banking and currency committees of the congress so the fed notified congress well in a speech as i said earlier as i have noted chairman martin tried his best to play down the feds plan to establish a swap fund when he testified before the congress the extent of the feds obfuscation is illustrated by the fact that the fed never asked the congress for enabling legislation why not the idea was to go ahead with as little fuss as possible which is always the argument given to us act quick fast i have always said that fast government can be dangerous government if congress did not pick up on the importance of the deal so much the better for in the feds eyes silence would amount to consent and the idea was not to wake any sleeping watchdogs there was not unanimity though at the federal reserve for that decision to establish a swap fund during the 1962 federal reserve meetings one of the federal reserve board governors j l robertson expressed concern about the proposed establishment of this fund chairman greenspan has been trying to play down the extent of governor robertsons concerns in his may 9th letter to me chairman greenspan depicts the dissent at the february 13 1962 fomc meetings as the expression of mere reservation i disagree with that interpretation during that meeting governor robertson asked if there were anyadvantages aside from the federal reserves unlimited pocketbookand by the way that reminds me at the time in 1984 that the continental illinols bank went under and incidentally the congress and our committee unfortunately never did go into that to establish the underlying cause it was a harbinger of the crisis that still continues to confront us in the financial and with reference to my concern the insured depository institutions why because those are the ones that the taxpayers guarantee stands behind but in 1984 the continental illinois went under and it took as i found out later 6 billion of the fedand that is taxpayers moneyto shore things up now the reasons why that crisis were first underlying causesand then immediate causesthe immediate cause was that the continental illinois had changed from its old conservative i would not use the word conservative but frugal and prudent methods and went into competition with the new york international banks thinking that they were going to be no 1 in effect the year before it went under it was rated the no 1 bank and when it did so it exposed itself as our whole country is exposed today the treasury which just until recently the japanese owned twothirds of our treasury of our debt and in direct acquisition of assets and indirect acquisition of assets we hear a lot about the japanese but great britain has 2h times more than the japanese and that is inclusive of banking in fact in california the japanese banking interests own over 25 percent this is the reason why i had the only hearings any committee really had on pertinent sections of the socalled nafta agreement the ones that we held three three hearings we were totally blanked out by the press they did not report it did not cover it and did not want to go into it but it was very disturbing and in those hearings we brought out more than several things and that was that the socalled free trade agreement had very little to do with trade over 90 percent of it is the power that the big banks in our countrythat was the locomotive it was chapter 14 information which we had the hearings entitled banking and finance to the port of nafta the big banks where mexico has an exposure of over 80 billion it has not even been able to pay the interest it has had to roll over the interest these banks thought boy we get nafta pushed through and when it is in place mexico will be able to pay us 10 billion a year well it is illusory why because in opening it up for the american banks and it will be a few it also for the first time is now apparent that in the united states we have subsidiaries of foreign banks as we brought out that still needs a congress to act our committee is still acting on bnl bcci because it shows a vulnerability to these foreign monies and activities of our system and believe it or not nafta is supposed to be a regionalmaybe western hemisphere so we will have after gatt which will be known as a world trade organization after a whilewill give the asia japanese et cetera block the european community block and of course the united states western hemisphere but japan has been coming in as well as france and other countries in latin america like they did before world war ii so nafta is supposed to ensure the hegemony of banking and financial activity but lo and behold i have news for my colleagues since you did it in secrecy the congress for the first time conceded and delegated what i consider to be nondelegable constitutional power wait and see time will tell but in the meanwhile the japanese banks through their subsidiaries in the united states have found a way to get into mexico that my friends is what we were trying to bring out in order to have a full evaluation of this agreement that was reached in total secrecy who wrote that agreement nafta can any of my colleagues mention the participants i say no you cant we brought that out in one of those three hearings but also going back to 1984 this is the hubris this is the spirit of power total incontrovertible and unquestioning power that these folks demand and get from the fed and have gotten after that we had a brief hearing after continental went under it went under because immediately a little shopping mall bank in oklahoma had a get an up and go 28yearold and he came to continental and was able to evade the timehonored limitation in banking where no one bank can lend morethan 15 percent with resources to any one borrower well this old smart boy whiz kid he was able to come to different iayers of the continental illinois and far exceed that then when the oil depression hit he could not pay continental began to suffer some questions the word went out into the foreign press and soon the japanese and the german inyestors pulled out 8 3 billion in 3 days boom went the bank fed came in with 6 billion so when mr chairman volcker came before us i asked him one question well you say that the reason you did that is because youre not going to suffer because of the ripple effect any large bank could go under now suppose you have two or three more of these he said i dont care i will use every resource of this country to save them i say now isnt that wonderful to have that tremendous unheard of unprecedented in the annals of human history power to have these private banketeers through bad judgment bad banking be able to be shored up by the taxpayer and saved from their folly and then there was born this socalled toobigtofail doctrine i could not persuade the chairman at that time to have followup hearings and challenge that power absolutely not so i must say by way of parenthesis that when governor robertson asked if there were any advantages aside from the federal reserves unlimited pocketbook and this is what paul volcker had in mind i will use every resource this country owns every resource for what to save the privileged bankers from their folly i ask wouldnt it be nice if other businessmen who lost out because of something they couldnt control in the market could have the same provision keep them in business even though they failed governor robertson opposed the federal reserves entry into the operation partly on legal grounds his objections were very strong as revealed in the minutes not like chairman greenspan is trying to pawn them over now at the february 13 1962 board of governors meeting he voted against amending regulation and to authorize the federal reserve to conduct a planned foreign exchange operation only after that authority was passed giving away the boys authority to the fomc did he join with the majority later in the day at the fomc meeting his opposition was indeed much more telling than having mere reservations and should be reviewed by present fomc members and others interested in the way the original swap facility came into existence chairman greenspan sent the committee on banking finance and urban affairs a list of 60 institutions which the federal reserve bank of new york transacted foreign exchange business for unitedstates monetary authorities since 1989 i would like to know how these institutions are selected and whatsafeguards are in place to prevent the release of exploitable inside information about foreign currency operations which incidentally is one of the biggest worldwide gambling casinos in operation on the socalled futures on international currency worth and transactions andi have spoken out on that before so iwill not repeat it today but i want to know how these institutions are selected at 60 since 1989 is this information insiders could learn about and then make a profit from as happened in the other section where the federal reserve has this privileged select group in the case of these security bankers buying treasury bills and where we had the big steel buy the big firm out of new york less than 2 years ago what happened after that did they ever pay that money about 2 billion the treasury lost on that gambling no they did not they were fined about 200 million with this a distinct possibility can we be confident that the fed is really df nding the store after all we have already seen how bond traders could and did abuse their privileged position in what i just referred to the treasury bond market the legislation i have introduced the federal reserve system accountability act of 1993 significantly increases congressional oversight of the fed without tampering with any of its independence in such things as determined monetary policy not at all in fact even a distinguished member of the committee the ranking minority members says whether he agrees or not that my position is relatively mild that there is nothing radical about it of course it is not unless we are willing now to say that if you stand up to have accountability to the people who elected us i say to my colleagues is being radical unless we are ready to say that we will unconstitutionally delegate the nondelegable power mandated only by the constitution as the power to declare war the power to coin our money and the power to determine the value thereof that is vested only in the congress and there were good reasons for that but until we address this question the congress has abdicated its power anyone who believes in an open ac countable government should and j hope will join me in finding these fed imposed restrictions an outrage i have asked and i have pleaded with my colleagues to join me in this effort the american people have every right tr complete accountability of course there have always been two schools of thought throughout mankinds experience with governmentthose who believe that unless there was a select group chosen because of superior ability to tell the people what was good for them why no good would come of it and you would not have law and order then you have the other school of thought that says no that maybe in the short run people will make mistakes but in the long run the people are the better judges as to what is good or best for them and that has been at the core of the american idea of government but we are now insuring ourselves to the european continental concept of accepting their idea with contentment in the midst of poverty and abdicating our ability to govern ourselves to some of these exclusively selected higher beings the bankers to tell us how they are going to struggle in our behalf and in secret they are so proud of this that they do it all in secret no i say the time is upon us it is later than we think i say to my colleagues and i ask them to join me in this legislation there are these powerful banking lobbyists who have written it off for this congress but i am going to try and will keep on trying as long as i am digcharging this responsibility even as i have had the responsibility before i still have this responsibility the bill also requires the general accounting office the only arm we ha0 in congress to oversee the executive branch to scrutinize certain federal reserve operations including those of the swap fund the fed lobbied congress in 1978 so that the gaq would not be allowed to investigate a swap we came very close in 1978 but not quite and the federal reserve through its bank members and lobbyists really worked it over anyone who believes in an open and accountable governmentwill join me i repeat in protesting and correcting these injustices i hope that i can elicit the support necessary on h r 28 i have a fairly good number of members of the committee but we are going to have to have a definite majority to get it out of committee this socalled central bank known as the fed should no longer have the ability to arrogate to itself new powersandkeep all of us in the dark about its policies and processes all we seek is just plain sinple honest accountability mr speaker i include with my remarks the following items first may 16 1994
