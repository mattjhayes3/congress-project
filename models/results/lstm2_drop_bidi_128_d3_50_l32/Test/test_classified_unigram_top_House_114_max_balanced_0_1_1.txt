members of the michigan delegation led by flints representative congressman dan kildee who are fighting every day to bring justice to these families their work is essential to ensuring the people of flint have the resources that they need to recover the situation in flint is nothing short of a tragedy and a tragedy that could have been prevented michigan state officials sacrificed the health and futures of flints children in order to save a few dollars in water costs this really is a shame and a disgrace i have to ask would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where politicians believe the residents are expendable sadly i think we all know the answer to that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals it is clear that the american people need congress to do its job the women in florida who cant leave

between the attitudes of the republicancontrolled congress and the needs and desires of the american people why should america be the only developed nation on the planet that cannot protect its families from gun violence obviously there are no simple solutions in a nation where there is a gun for every adult where a halfdozen people have been killed in recent years by their pets and even babies kill parents and their siblings with guns too many people feel that more guns and fewer protections is the solution obscuring the fact that the overwhelming majority of the american public agrees that there are things we can do and that it is irresponsible and cynical not to try for more than 24 hours last week my democratic colleagues and i discussed many of these solutions on the floor of the house demanding action on three for instance over 90 percent of the american public and a majority of gun owners agreed that there should be no anonymous secret purchases of weapons there should be a universal background check people who cannot buy firearms at a gun store should not be able to buy guns over the internet or at gun shows anonymously the american public supports us in our efforts to make it harder for people the government has deemed too dangerous to buy a plane ticket to purchase assault weapons and it is past time to eliminate the outrageous prohibition against the centers for disease control to even study the epidemic of gun violence that kills three or four americans every hour these solutions are not really that hard they would be a signal that we are serious about trying to change the gun violence equation that kills about 90 people every day i returned to oregon last week and had encouraging meetings with dozens of people who have been leading the charge in my home state who are redoubling their efforts they have demonstrated that steps can be taken through the political process and are committed to building upon their commonsense actions for example they led the charge to prevent people with a history of domestic violence and restraining orders from purchasing guns the oregon legislature finally enacted universal background checks like we are seeking at the federal level and the oregon house of representatives even passed legislation last session that would have closed the socalled charleston loophole where law enforcement has a 10day delay for a purchase if the police are unable to determine that purchasers qualifications i was impressed and encouraged that these ordinary citizens so devoted to this cause are committing to taking on the issue further at the state and local level and making it an issue in the political elections in the fall wherever they can it is only that type of activity that will overcome the inertia the temerity and the cynicism of people who are apologists for gun violence the same way we embarked upon a decadeslong crusade to reduce traffic fatalities that cut that death rate in half we need to embark on a similar crusade to reduce gun violence the members who took to the floor over 24 hours showed a powerful expression of policy and emotion that used to be seen on the floor of this house

believe that lawabiding citizens have a constitutional right to own firearms whether for sport or personal protection but i also know that responsible personal freedom and public safety are not

discussion with my fellow colleagues and with those people throughout the united states who are watching this and reading this issue i wish to discuss is a matter of grave concern to me and i believe to the american people as well i came here 26 years ago prior to my arrival in the united states congress i had served 7 years in the reagan white house i was a speechwriter to president reagan and i was a special assistant to the president which was a designated rank at the white house i recall what it was like in the time leading up to ronald reagans election and i recall specifically how ronald reagan dealt with the great challenges he faced before ronald reagan came to the white house america was in retreat there was a sense of pessimism throughout our country our economy was topsyturvy there were high levels of inflation and high levels of unemployment our country was in jeopardy our country felt a danger because while we were in retreat communismsoviet communismwas on the offensive throughout the world well ronald reagan in 8 short years turned that situation totally around he turned the economy around and he turned around the spirit of the people we went from being pessimistic to being the most optimistic and forwardlooking people in the world yes he helped the economy but foremost ronald reagan ended the cold war i am 67 years old during my life most of us felt that some day we would be at war with the soviet uniona shooting warand that it might take the lives of millions of people we were told to hide under our desk when we were young and cover up our heads in case there was a nuclear attack on our country ronald reagan expanded the united states military many times when people look back and they understand the success that we had in ending the cold war they believe that it was due to the increase in the size of our military let me note that did play a factor because it was a deterrent factor and it was a factor that awed many people in the developing world as well as our enemies in the communist world but that is not what switched and that is not what changed our retreat in the cold war to a great victory and the bringing down of the berlin wall what changed it was a change in strategy that ronald reagan initiated during the time that he was president he was a strong leader we came into the white house and people asked what is your strategy for dealing with the soviet threat to our freedom and the peace of the world he said the strategy is very simple we win and they lose that is what he set out the guidelines that he set out for us who worked for him in the white house and throughout the administration were that our goal was to be that the united states would win the cold war and the soviet union would lose well during that time period ronald reagan did not deploy american troops overseas like people think that he did yes he expanded our military power but he made very few deploymentsmajor deploymentsof american troops in fact in one deployment which he made to beirut where he sent thousands of marines to beirut i personally was arguing against it in the white house and went around finding out what it was all about after a few short weeks it turned into a fiasco it turned into a tragedy as well as a fiasco i might add 300 americans marines and sailors lost their lives when their headquarters was blown uptheir bunker you might say their barracks in beirut was blown up ronald reagans advisers at that time advised him to send in tens of thousands of more american troopers send in the entire 2nd marine division and show these terrorists they cant kill marines and get away with it ronald reagan made his best decision as president at that time not to make such a huge major deployment of troops into beirut otherwise we would have been in a quagmire for the rest of his administration they would have been there stuck in this war zone in beirut a nowin situation reagan knew that he also knew when he told us no we are going to get out of there as soon as we can rather than get stuck in the quagmire he initiated another policy a security policy based on a different doctrine from sending american troops to garrison in the world or sending american troops to fight other peoples battles what it was was ronald reagan initiated the reagan doctrine the reagan doctrine was basically to recognize that the enemy of our enemy was our friend and to do everything we could to identify our friends around the world who would help us defeat the soviet union the reagan doctrine had us helping people in nicaragua who were fighting against the sandinista dictatorship which was allied with the soviet union it was in africa where you had cuban troops being confronted by insurgency movements that we supported that were prodemocracy or at least antisoviet and in afghanistan where the soviet army itself was being confronted the doctrine supported those who were struggling for freedom against oppression we helped people in europe the lech walesas and the various leaders throughout eastern europe who organized resistance against the soviet domination of their countries whether it was poland or czechoslovakia or hungary they received covert support from president reagan reagan wanted yes to defeat the soviet union and that is what we did we did it in a way by helping those who were on the front lines struggling against what we saw as an evilthat is a government in russia that was controlled by an atheistic theory that an atheist dictatorship imposed upon people could reestablish new values among human beings and thus create a whole new world that monstrous philosophymonstrous because it had monstrous implications in terms of human freedom but also in the control and slaughter of those people who did not agree with that visionthat had to be defeated because it threatened the entire world by the time ronald reagan was finished with his presidency and the leadership that he provided to the free world and all those who were struggling against communism we succeeded the berlin wall came down this was done because of great leadership and a great strategy on the part of this man today we look at a totally different world from the world that reagan left us unlike the world that he inherited from his predecessor president carter reagan left us a world where the upward trend toward our civilization was undeniable that it looked like we could have generations of peace and that our enemies respected us to the point that they would not put us in jeopardy because it would be putting themselves in jeopardy reagan gave us chances for peace prosperity and freedom throughout the world today we face a totally different world it is a frightening world we have today an adversary that is every bit as evil potentially harmful and destructive to the people of the world as what we faced when ronald reagan came to the presidency at the height of the cold war yes everything was dangerous at that time and reagan gave us peace and security today we are facing evil and danger as even before in the cold war but perhaps we can compare this even to the evil and danger that america and the western world faced in the early thirties and the late twenties when nazism and fascism raised its ugly head what happened during that time period had we and the western allies been able to deal with adolf hitler perhaps there would not have been this huge conflagration of world war ii which took the lives of hundreds of millions of people but they did not deal with that as ronald reagan dealt with communism when he became president and hitler and the fascist threat eventually with their aggression put the free world and those other people who sought a better world in such a spot that war erupted and world war ii that great conflagration happened it was avoidable well today we face a similar threat we face an evil that as i say is every bit as dangerous as the evil that was faced by reagan and faced before world war ii it is a radical islamic philosophy that will slaughter people in the west without thinking twice about it or what is even worse will slaughter people in great numbers in the west after strategizing of how to do it more effectivelynot only slaughtering christians and other nonmuslims but this evil force is seeking to dominate that part of the world in which the majority of people are of the islamic faith this radical islamic terrorist evil murders more muslims than indeed they murder christians although they have been very aggressive in their murder of christians in a very demonstrable way in a way that would try to intimidate the christian world and the nonmuslim world but we have brave and courageous people within the muslim world we must not let ourselves be brought to the point that the radical islamic movement wants us to be in and that is to alienate the rest of the billion of muslims who occupy this planet and make them our enemy like ronald reagan we must seek out our friends throughout the world who are struggling against radical islamic terrorism and dictatorship and make sure that we back them up so they will have a chance to defeat this threat and this ongoing murder and chaos that is engulfing their own countries today we have such heroes overseas let us note in the last 6 years this threat has grown has gone from miniscule to being a threat that if we do not deal with it could erupt into the same type of global conflagration that we saw in world war ii and perhapsor at bestwould leave us with a war with a global split in the world like happened under communism that we defeated under ronald reagan yes we could see if this threat of radical islam is not confronted with american leadership 10 years down the road there could be a massive conflagration that would encompass for example what would happen if we do lose total control and things go totally out of control into the gulf areas in the persian gulf and in the arab world if that part of the world becomes dominant if the dominant force in that part of the world becomes this radical islamic philosophy it will then move to the stans it will then move to the great parts of africa and of central asia and that will tip the balance of power in this planet and will lead to the type of global conflagration that all of us want to avoid and to prevent but we must have the type of decisive leadership and the type of actual commitment to winning this battle against the radical islamic dictatorship that these people are trying to superimpose upon the world we need the strong commitment that we saw under ronald reagan we need that and we do not have it we do not have the leadership we need or the type of chaos that is now erupting in the arab world would not be happening what is happening in this chaos that we see is this rise of isil a group of people who are so committed to establishing a muslim dictatorship throughout their part of the world and throughout africa and yes even throughout the rest of the world where other nonmuslim communities live these people are dedicated to terrorizing the world into submission to their authority and they see their authority as coming from their radical version of god through their radical version of islam again most muslims deny and reject that type of islam but let us not forget let us not ignore the fact that this radical philosophy is based on their interpretation of islam that it is a religious fanaticism that could just like communism was a religious fanaticismit was an atheism fanaticism and we have seen christian fanaticisms in the past and they did great damage and cost the lives of great numbers of people in their day this radical fanaticism unless we defeat it now will perhaps drag the entire planet into a world war iilike conflagration how do we stop that how was ronald reagan able to stop the rise of communism the soviet expansionism that he faced when he took office and in 7 or 8 short years managed to turn that around and defeat that very enemy first he had the commitment to defeat it and i will say today that i dont believe our president has the commitment to defeat and destroy radical islamic terrorism and the radical islamic dictatorship that these fanatics would superimpose upon us instead i think our president believes in good faith that he can reach an accommodation with these folks with these fanatics that an accommodation can be reached and that we should try to prove to them that we are not their enemy well they know they are our enemy because they get their word from god not from the president of the united states that is what they believe they see these overtures the fanatic radicals like in the taliban they see it as a weakness and it only encourages the radical islamic movement for our president to try to reach accommodation or to say pleasant things to them without being aggressive with seeming to be unwilling to actually draw a line in the sand our president as most people know has trouble even uttering the words islamic terrorism in one sentence we are not going to be successful in defeating this threat that would murder us by the millions of people if they get the chance if our president is not even willing to utter the words islamic terrorism in the same sentence we have a president that after our ambassador was murdered in benghazi tried to foist off on the american people the false story that our ambassador was killed because a demonstration against a movie that insulted islam got out of control and the demonstrators killed our ambassador for weeks this president himself participated in spreading that lie now what message does it give us first of all my gosh our president isnt going to tell us the truth about radical islam but what did the muslim terrorists think at that moment the muslim terrorists were thinking my goodness we have a guy that is so weak that he cant even condemn us and condemn the killing of his own ambassador by our movement this emboldened them and that is why we heard early on support for various reform movements and we all hoped that the arab spring would be a reform movement instead our president unlike ronald reagan who sought to help those people who were the most aggressive opponents of soviet communism this president has tried to seek out those people in the muslim brotherhood and elsewhere and reach an accommodation with them that is why today we see enormous chaos and the rise of a radical fanatic islamic movement isil that will burn people alive that will recruit people throughout the west to murder people in a newspaper like we just saw in paris for drawing a cartoon that in some way made fun of their beliefs as if people arent free to make fun of other peoples beliefs no they think it is all right to murder those people and that is less civilthat is not even a sin that is a mandate as compared to murdering unarmed people an unarmed cartoonist newspaper cartoonist in france and his colleagues a policeman who happened to be a muslim laying there helpless on the ground and they murdered him outright this is fanaticism this is part of a fanatic radical islamic movement that has to be stopped they will not stop at killing one policeman who happens to be a muslim on the ground they will murder millions of others if they get the chance they are trying to establish themselves throughout the arab world right now we need to make sure we stand by our friends yet unlike ronald reagan and there was no doubt he was standing behind our friends who opposed soviet communism but what are we projecting to those people who are standing firm against this fanatic radical islamic movement that would put an islamic dictatorship on the people what are we telling our friends who are standing up against that well how about president elsisi of egypt elsisi was a general who stepped in at a time when egypt could have gone either way we had a radical islamic movement going there yes there was an elected president and he broke his word to his own people in trying to institute a caliphate in egypt they rose up against him in an aggressive shout from the people of egypt saying we will not let our country become an islamic caliphate this is egypt we believe in a democratic government here and we believe in an egyptian governmentnot some radical fanatic arab government that was superimposed on them by members of some muslim brotherhood that operates behind the scenes well we almost lost egypt and if egypt would fall today or would have fallen then there would be no chance of stopping this fanatic movement that threatens the world and threatens especially other muslim countries there would have been no chance at all president elsisi is a courageous man who has stepped forward and our president took a long time and is still taking a long time in getting solidly behind the effort to prevent egypt from becoming a bastion of fanatic islamic radicalism that would threaten the world general elsisi i visited him a year ago and he expressed my goodness we bought all of these helicopters from the united states and we need them now because there is an insurgency going on with radicals out in the sinai desert we need these helicopters and it took forever for our administration this government to provide them the spare parts the spare parts for that effort they have jumped through hoops we were doing them a favor no we should look at these people as doing us a favor they are on the front lines battling this and president elsisi just recently did something that all americans and peaceloving people throughout the world should applaud and that is he went directly to muslim groups in egypt and spoke to them and spoke on the record saying we have got to cleanse ourselves from this fanaticism in which we are intolerant of other peoples religions these people who would murder other people and commit acts of terrorism president elsisi that was courageous of him we need other leaders to follow in his footsteps has our administration done anything to congratulate president elsisi in making that incredible stand what type of things have we done to prove that we are behind him in this effort he also did something else president elsisi was the first president of egypt ever to visit a coptic church a christian church in egypt yet this administration has been just soso when it comes to elsisi yes we have not undermined him but we have not given him support which would have been a signal to all of the other leaders there to stand firm and america will stand behind you we have people like for instance the king of jordan who was only here just a few days ago and what happened a jordanian pilot was put into a cage and burned to death as a public spectacle a jordanian pilot why did they do that why did these fanatics do that because they meant to terrorize the people of the world terrorize the people of africa terrorize other people who would stand up against them and what was abdullahs reaction to that he left his meetings in the united states and flew back to jordan it is now being said that he personally flew a bombing mission against the isil people who burned that man alive now there is a leader and we should be backing him up but what do we hear just in the paper the other day that jordan is having difficulty in getting the supplies of weapons and arms that they need to make sure that they can stand firm against isil and this horrible radical fanatic movement that is sweeping through their part of the world ronald reagan knew that we needed to support great leaders who would help us end the cold war we will bring about war if leaders like king abdullah in jordan and president elsisi in egyptif people think we wont get behind them how can we count on others to take that stand how about the kurds up in northern iraq they are the ones bearing the burden bearing the brunt of all of the fighting that is going on now in iraq the other people when we tried to work things through baghdad and tried to accommodate leaders who were halfheartedly in this battle and really werent committed what happened we gave them enormous amounts of military equipment that ended up in the hands of radicals ended up being used as vehicles and guns to destroy and kill people who want the type of world that we want to live in which is a world of tolerance and freedom and peace and prosperity not radical fanatic muslim dictatorship instead the kurds have stood firm the kurds are the one group in iraq that have stood firm and are the one group that has received the least support from the united states as compared to the others now baghdad which wants to put their thumb down on the kurds we are going along with a demand with those people that all our aid that goes to the kurds goes to baghdad first that is recognizing the people who are not really on our side their power over the people who are on our side in fact there was a meeting in london just in the last few days i guess it was last weekto determine what would go on in iraq the united states was of course maybe not sitting at the table but helped organize this and were part of the process of trying to get this meeting together we didnt even insist that the kurds were there the kurds werent even at the table this is a betrayal of the people who are on the front lines fighting the big fight of today against radical islamic terrorism we betrayed them this is horrible what kind of message does that send to other people around the world who have to stand up against this onslaught of radical fanatic islamic terrorist dictatorship that would be superimposed on them we have got to make sure that these people understandwhether it is abdullahor how about the crown prince of abu dhabi for example here is a man who is so strong in his conviction and leadership in that part of the world to try to stop this terrible threat yes he is treated well we should be honoring him our administration should be leading the efforts to take the abdullahs and the crown prince there in abu dhabi and president elsisi these people deserve demonstrable support not just sort of halfheartedly getting behind them what about for example even qatar today qatar is trying to make a decision as to what to do in the face of this for example they permit us to have airstrikes against isilthis radical islamic group up in iraqthey are permitting us to use an air base in qatar to launch those attacks but we should make sure people understand and are grateful to them for it and be demonstrable about it part of it is yes stand up with your friends if somebody does something good like qatar has just done and wants to go backand by the way has taken some steps in the right direction after taking some steps in the wrong directionthey lost faith in us i believe and now they are coming back in our direction we should encourage that the other half of the equation is we need to be tough on the guys who are our enemies who are going the wrong way who are supporting radical islamic fanatic terrorism like for example pakistan we are still giving billions of dollars over a 10year period to pakistan we are giving hundreds of millions of dollars of military equipment and foreign aid to a country that is yes supporting the taliban almost all of the people that we have lost in afghanistan can be traced back to terrorists who are using pakistan as a home base but not only as a home base the isi have been actively involved in helping these fanatic terrorists that our people were up against in afghanistan how do we know that well we do know that it is known but maybe just the fact that they were giving safe haven to osama bin ladenthe murderer of 3 000 americans on 9 11they gave safe haven to this man this was oh we didnt know no one believes that they knew now to add insult to injury they have taken the doctor who gave us the location of osama bin laden and helped us bring osama bin laden to justice that doctor dr afridi is now languishing in a dungeon in a 10by10foot cell in pakistan that act by pakistan is a hostile act to the united states and for us to walk away and ignore it is to encourage others to treat us in the same way we must be tough on our enemies and friends to our friends is that a difficult formula is that too difficult for people to understand we are losing today because i believe this president has been treating our enemies better than he has been treating our friends in many cases in terms of willing to reach out to them we should be reaching out and trying to do everything we can to help the friendly countries rather than reaching out to seek accommodations with these evil countries nowhere is that better demonstrated than the announcement that we had secretly negotiated a deal with fidel castros regime in cubasecretly negotiated congress didnt know what was going on and now he has announced by edict his executive orders here is a presidentmaybe he likes castro a little bit because castro after all he could rule with edicts just like our president now likes to rule with edicts rather than go through what we call your regular order as seeking the legislative branch and seeking compromises and establishing policy in that way instead this president reversed 50 years of american policy towards cuba on his own rather than coming here to congress and working out something with us and trying to find what was the best way and opening up cuba to having the beginning of an economic relationship and having americans go freely there and then to come to the united states well he did that and there were no concessions none that the cubans made for this president to give up that 50 years 50 years of this is what our policy is you are going to have to do thisfree elections opposition parties et ceterathen we will recognize you this president gave it up and no concessions on the other side now by the way what message does that send to all these other countries again it is not just cuba what message does that send to all these other countries when we complain about human rights or we try to set a standard some standard that will indeed take that country in the right direction we end up giving up a 50year policy with no concessions thus every little petty dictator in the world or even worse every group that is out there who is trying to decide whether or not to go with radical islamist terrorism or not they know they can make whatever decision they want and eventually the united states is going to cave in because we are projecting weakness as i say the one thing ronald reagan did that was terrific was to rebuild our military and it didit created a sense of awe but it was a sense of strength he used that sense of strength but it was his strategy in helping those people throughout the world who are our friends and the friends of things we believed in and the enemy of our enemies that is what worked we are sending the wrong message to the people who will be the enemy of our enemies we are undermining by not providing positive and forceful support for those people who are standing upthe crown prince of abu dhabi and these others and abdullah and jordan and president elsisi in egyptby not demonstrably standing with them we send the wrong message throughout the world that is why things are falling apart that is why things are not going in the right direction this isnt we just happen to live in a time when things are chaotic that is not the case just like ronald reagan didnt just live in the times when there was a soviet communist threat that was undermining the peace of the world that didnt just happen it was the basis of things that yes what they did but also our response to that threat today this administration i believe has led us down a path that has created the chaos that we now see created a situation where you have a radical fanatic islamic dictatorship movement that not only tries to take over and dominate the islamic part of the world but is threatening terrorist acts and has engaged in terrorist acts we will have more and more bombings like we saw at the boston marathon we will have more and more terrorist actions taken in western europe as we saw in paris or in africa unless we step forward and let the world know that we are strong we are strong in our commitment and we stand by those who will help us in this battle i recently visited new york city and i had not been there for a long time i had never gone to the 9111 memorial i visited the 9111 memorial and i would advise anyone who has not been there to go there this is a memorial to the 3 000 americans who died on 9111 most of them there at the world trade center in those two great towers that were brought down on that day you should go anyone hearing my voicemy colleagues othersshould go and see this they have managed to get a picture of almost every one of the victims who died that day many of course were firemen and policemen who when the airplane struck that building instead of running away and rushing away they ran towards the building they ran there to see what they could do to help and they gave their lives these heroic people we have to have a government as heroic as our own people if we are going to triumph over the people that slaughtered those people today they slaughtered them in 9111 and they will slaughter them today i looked at those pictures of those 3 000 peopleand i was in the government when that happened and i worked with reagan before that but on 9111 we had been here a long time and we are all part of this we owe it to the people of the united states all of us on both sides of the aisle and in the executive branch and whoever else who is the government of this country we owe it to our people to make sure we are doing the right thingand i looked into their faces and i brought my children with me to see this and i said look all of those people do you know what they are telling us they are telling us to me and to all of us here in this body you let us down you let us down dont do it again dont let there be another wall in another city with 20 000 pictures on it because they have got some sort of dirty bomb or something these people that we are facing today are capable of that i am not arguing for major deployments of military units overseas occupation garrison in the world like we did for too long and i do not think it was right for us to go into iraq in the first place i do argue that when we find people on our side like ronald reagan did we need to have a strong military and we need to make sure that the world respects us then we need to have stands and activities and actions that win their respect them knowing that we stand with those people who will stand firm against this threat to the world otherwise some day there could be another world war iilike thing 10 years down the road when we say why didnt you stop that fanatic hitler when he was just walking around goosestepping around in these towns in germany when he could have been stopped why didnt you stop him then then there was hundreds of millions of people this could lead to that type of conflagration one thing we know unless we stop this radical movement there now they will find ways of killing thousands of americans and there will be other walls with other pictures saying why didnt you do something i call on my colleagues now to seriously look at this challenge that we face my negative comments about what i believe is the president not dealing with this situation in the right way is something that i am saying from the heart and i am not doing this for political reasons let me just say today that we see examples of where we need to take stands we need to make sure for example that the nouveau regime in iran is facing a president of the united states and an american government that are making demands that they do not use this system that they are developing now they have signed a treaty saying they would not have a nuclear weapon we should hold them to that treaty and we should be helping the people in iran who are struggling against that nouveau regime i do not say we should attack iran with american military might we should be supportive and we should have been so all along there were demonstrators in the streets of tehran and there was no message there was no message at all of support from our government at that time that was one of the first things this president didhe refrained from helping and supporting those young activists for democracy in iran the baloch people are fighting against the corruption and oppression of the pakistani government which is dominated by these radicals we should be helping the baloch who can also be active in iran i might say there are options that we can have throughout the world todayactions both in terms of policy and in terms of actually helping people struggle for freedomthat will ensure the peace of the world 10 years down the road as ronald reagan did when he took over he left us a better world we need to take the steps now to make sure that when we leave this body when we leave congressand whoever becomes president the next time aroundthat we leave this government so that our people have a greater chance for freedom a greater chance to live in peace we need to make sure that our people can live in peace and prosperity those pictures on the wall at the 9 11

moment it is a part of our history and it is a tragic event from which we can learn and we can actually grow i think as a nation the enlisted men stationed at the port chicago naval magazine including the port chicago 50 served our nation proudly and they served her honorably for that they deserve our gratitude for those unfamiliar with the story and i know it has already been talked about but i would like to talk about it very briefly again following a catastrophic cargo vessel explosion on july 17 1944 which killed or wounded 710 people several enlisted men voiced concerns about continuing to handle munitions at the port among those voicing concerns were two gentlemen from cincinnati ohio from the area that i am proud to serve mentor burns and edward lee longmire both men enlisted in 1943 they were not lifelong soldiers with extensive training they were ordinary patriotic americans doing their part to help in the war effort mr burns was a woodturner in a furniture factory before enlisting mr longmire worked as a sales clerk selling poultry nothing in their background prepared them for handling munitions and unfortunately the navy at that time did not provide adequate training for the men serving at port chicago so it is understandable that the men who survived the explosion were reluctant to continue loading munitions without efforts to make the process safer for that they were charged with mutiny reluctance and even refusal to return to unsafe conditions and procedures is not mutiny it is common sense america is the greatest country on the face of the globe but that doesnt mean we dont at times make mistakes and that is what happened here injustices like the mutiny convictions for the port chicago 50 certainly fall within that category however one of the things that makes america great is the freedom of the american people and the peoples elected representatives to speak out against injustices correct past wrongs and strive for a better future for all of us we cant go back in time and prevent the convictions of the port chicago 50 but we can correct the record and we can exonerate those wrongfully convicted and give their families and their loved ones the peace of knowing that they served our nation honorably and faithfully and that they did nothing wrong it is far past time that the port chicago 50 received justice we owe it to mr burns mr

jobs and our fishermen by promoting better science and requiring state and local data to be considered in federal decisionmaking about fisheries last year i spoke with commercial fishermen from the pacific coast atlantic coast and the gulf of mexico and the common theme in our discussions was the need for better data and scientific analysis to improve management the unitedstates has a long and profitable heritage in fishing to continue that heritage we need to have quality diverse data and scientific analysis to facilitate educated decisionmaking on fishery management h r 1335 allows for just that the bill increases transparency and provides muchneeded flexibility in the law for fishery managers to properly consider the environmental and economic impacts of decisions affecting fishing communities and it is important to note that h r 1335 makes all of these key reforms to fisheries management without authorizing any new additional federal spending we can do the job with the existing

mr ratcliffe"], [0.001770108938217163, 0.49822989106178284, 1, "let me thank the gentlewoman from connecticut for her kindness as well let me thank the chair and ranking member of the appropriations committee because we know the work that they have done let me just simply say that i am very disappointed that we are now settling for a cr that continues to have a sequester that cuts across and denies border patrol agents customs and border protection secret service and leaves the american people vulnerable so the first order of business is that we are not doing what we are supposed to do in providing for the american people now we move to another unseemly legislative initiative that is attacking womens health and what does that mean we use it under the guise of planned parenthood planned parenthood has any number of clinics in almost 50 states that deal with womens health contraception sexually transmitted disease places where women who are impoverished can go when they cannot go anywhere else in a hearing yesterday someone was debating why they dont do mammograms women know that when we go to any doctor the doctor refers mammograms so this is a bad bill it is against womens health the sequester is bad vote down both bills i rise in strong opposition to h con res 79 we are here again wasting valuable time on measures we know are having no real chance of survival beyond these debates i strongly oppose this continued effort to drag womens health issues and womens rights through this political circus at what point will the majority step back and get regal about substantive and genuine legislation the amount of legislative time we have wasted on these offensive messaging bills is ridiculous and must end our constituents deserve better our legislative and public service roles demand more and as we approach yet another deadline for piecemeal fiscal fixes we should be focused on passing a comprehensive and costsavings budget yet we are here today debating another measure that threatens millions of americans access to preventative care and could end up costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars however we know h con res 79 is not a serious attempt at passing real legislation as such it is simply being offered here today as a shameless political decoy to attack the legal rights of women politicians are continuing to try to sneak around the constitution and four decades of supreme court precedent with sham laws that do nothing to improve womens health care and only make it more difficult if not impossible to obtain safe and legal abortion restricting all access to reproductive and womens health services only exacerbates a womans risk of an unintended pregnancy and fails to accomplish any meaningful overthrow of roe v wade in recent years state policymakers have passed hundreds of restrictions on abortion care under the guise of protecting womens health and safety fights here in congress have been no different in my state of texas a law that would have cut off access to 75 percent of reproductive healthcare clinics in the state was challenged before the unitedstates supreme court in 2014 and on october 2 2014 the supreme court struck down as unconstitutional a texas law that required that all reproductive healthcare clinics that provided the full range of services would be required to have a hospitalstyle surgery center building and staffing requirements this requirement meant that only 7 clinics would be allowed to continue to provide a full spectrum of reproductive healthcare to women any woman facing an unintended pregnancy needs to be able to make her own decisions and weigh all her optionsand these laws take those options away texas has 268 580 square miles only second in size to the state of alaska the impact of the law in implementation would have ended access to reproductive services for millions of women in my state in 2015 the state of texas once again threatened womens access to reproductive health care when it attempted to shutter all but 10 healthcare providers in the state of texas the supreme court once again intervened on the behalf of texas women to block the move to close clinics in my state it seems every month we are faced with a new attack on womens access to reproductive health care often couched in deceptive terms and concern for womens health and safety and in fact we are here today supposedly to talk about the safety of womenbut we know thats not really the case if my colleagues were so concerned about womens health and safety they would be promoting any one of the number of evidencebased proactive policies that improve womens health and wellbeing instead they are proposing yet another attempt to ban abortion that is their number one priority this is certainly not about protecting womens health its about politics we must separate the personal views of abortion from the legal issues and fundamental constitutional rights undisputable every woman has the constitutional right to make personal health care decisions so basic that it must be equally protected for all restricting access to womens reproductive health care providers makes it increasingly difficultand sometimes impossiblefor women who have decided to end a pregnancy to get the safe legal highquality care they need the result is not the elimination of abortions but higher costs longer delays and extra steps for women seeking abortion care and in the process punish women for their decision to exercise their constitutional right to end a pregnancy history tells us that unsafe and lateterm abortions did not cease to exist without adequate access to clinical service rather the exact oppositeas we know limited and restricted access only leads to unsafe and dangerous practices today countless women in states like texas and mississippi wisconsin alabama tennessee and louisianawhere state laws are already gravely impacting womens access to health care providerswomen are being forced to travel upwards of hundreds of miles or cross state lines to access their constitutional right to an abortion these restrictions create sharp disparities in access to care that are troublingly reminiscent of the time before roe v wade when access depended on a womans social status where she lived or her ability to travel to another state in an effort to undermine what they could not otherwise overturn politicians are attempting to turn back the clock to the preroe era by shuttering reproductive health care clinics and cutting off womens access to safe and legal abortion care yet far too many women who cannot afford to travel elsewhere will face an impossible choice between carrying an unintended pregnancy to term or seeking drastic options outside the law a right that only exists on paper is no right at all simply restricting a womens right and access to legal abortion services discriminately endangers the lives of women congress should be doing everything it can to ensure that women have access to preventive care not eliminating it this is a legislative assault on all progressive health care service and advocacy organizations who aim to provide vital care and services to women and men across this country hundreds of thousands have already spoken up including leading groups and communities such as the growing voice of our millennial generation for instance the nearly 60 000 obgyn physicians and partners in womens health warn that this bill would scare providers away from providing comprehensive compassionate care to women in a time where america desperately needs more obgyns participating in medicaid programs physicians and experts in the field have long argued that these damaging measures serve no medical purpose interfere in the doctor patient relationship and do nothing to promote womens health my colleagues should not be closing the door to health care services rather my colleagues should be doing more to connect our youth and women to services that help them reduce their risk of unintended pregnancies and stds and improve their overall health through preventative screenings education and planning and not restricting their access to lawfully entitled family planning and private health services i urge all members to vote against the continued attack on womens health and rights"]]}
