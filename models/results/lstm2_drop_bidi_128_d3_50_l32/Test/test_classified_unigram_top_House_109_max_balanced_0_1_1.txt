is an important issue for all of th country but especially true among ms 3 farmers and ranchers in kansas i am one who supports renewable fuels and ethanol and soy diesel pro 1 vide a great opportunity for economi u opportunity in kansas fot kansa farmers and for american agricultur f and for our country we must becom u much more independent from the en s ergy sources abroad but for our farmers and ranchers to remain in business to survive into the future they have got to have access to natural gas and at prices that are affordable natural gas is the primary feed stock the ingredient for the production of many agricultural components but especially for nitrogen fertilizer that is so important and if we are going to produce ethanol in this country if we are going to produce soy diesel we are going to have to have the fertilizer at an affordable price that will allow our farmers to raise the corn and grain sorghum to produce the ethanol to raise the soy beans to produce the soy diesel our farmers are struggling across the country input costs are dramatically on the rise nearly 40 percent of the nitrogen capacity fertilizer capacity has been shut down in this country since 1999 six years ago approximately 15 percent of our fertilizer needs were met in the united states from abroad today 50 percent is imported prices have increased dramatically 250 a ton for nitrogen fertilizer in 2002 today 416 one of my farmers who farms in southwest kansas 30 years ago when he started farming natural gas was 19 cents today it is 9 we are seeing double triple and even fourfold prices that donny young talks about in trying to stay in business with these increasing input costs while the price of corn has stayed the same we in the united states need to become independent if we are going to produce the ethanol and it is important that we remember that natural gas is necessary to make that nitrogen fertilizer i encourage the adoption of this proposal a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture agricultures ability to produce an affordable food supply will continue to face huge obstacles if our nation does not come to grips with its desire to have limitless resources like natural gas for production and not realize that these resources have to come from somewhere our natural gas crisis has two solutionsincrease supply and reduce demand h r 4761 addresses one aspect of this crisis as it will increase the supply of natural gas from the outer continental shelf this additional supply will do two things it will send a strong signal to natural gas markets and could increase the elasticity in north american natural gas markets it indicates to these futures markets that the united states is committed to lifting the moratoria in the outer continental shelf to provide consumers with an additional supply of natural gas this message should ease the volatility in natural gas prices that all of us have seen since 1999 and the additional supply should help ease the natural gas prices over time why does agriculture care so much about this natural gas crisis simply put agriculture is a very large consumer of natural gas farm3 ers use significant amounts of natural gas for food processing irrigation crop drying heating farm buildings and homes and for the pro duction of crop protection chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers natural gas is the primary feedstock in the production of virtually all commercial nitrogen fertilizers manufactured in the untied states natural gas is not just an energy source it is the raw material for producing the fertilizer today in the case of the nitrogen fertilizer anhydrous ammonia natural gas accounts for over 90 percent of the total cash cost of production just like kansas wheat and wisconsin milk fertilizer is a commodity bought and sold worldwide and subject to basic global supply and demand economic principles as the unitedstates domestic nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing sector declines due to high natural gas prices kansas farmers and other unitedstates food producers will be subject to global supply demand forces on the fertilizer products they buy even more so than today the climb in natural gas prices since 2q00 has forced unitedstates fertilizer production costs to unprecedented levels over this period of high prices and intense volatility the unitedstates fertilizer industry began to shut down production nearly 40 percent of the industrys nitrogen capacity permanently shut down between 1999 and today this has and will continue to make unitedstates farmers dependent on offshore production from the major suppliers such as saudi arabia venezuela and russia this rise in natural gas prices and the permanent closure of so much unitedstates fertilizer production has dramatically impacted fertilizer prices throughout the marketing chain and in particular at the farm level according to usda unitedstates prices to farmers for ammonia climbed from 250 per ton in 2002 to 416 per ton in 2005 that is almost a doubling of the price of ammonia to farmers this continued loss of production from the unitedstates nitrogen fertilizer industry would force farmers to rely on a highly uncertain and highly volatile world market with no assurance that they will be able to obtain enough product to meet their full demand this is particularly important when considering the importance of nitrogen to farmers thirty to 50 percent of corn yields are directly attributed to nitrogen fertilizer passing h r 4761 represents a direct positive action to increase our nations domestic natural gas supply to help relieve the high prices pressuring american farmers fertilizer producers and homeowners allowing exploration and development of the outer continental

mirrors the conflicting nature of his county fiercely wielding the sword of war when necessary in one hand while extending the olive branch of peace in the other few will be considered to have been more dedicated to the peace and security of his country than was yitzhak rabin as a young man rabins character was hardened by war he joined the army at 18 years old before it was named the israeli

commanded the israeli defense force in the six day war of 1964 shortly after leading his troops to a stunning decisive victory in that historical war rabin retired from the military to become a

the time i rise in support of the bassnorwood amendment i strongly support this amendment and i do so for several reasons first since the attacksof 9 11 states and local governments are increasingly stepping up to the plate and assuming some of what have traditionally been the federal governments responsibilities in the area of terrorism preparedness for example many state and local governments have entered into agreements with the unitedstates coast guard or with immigratioa and customs enforcement or other elements of the department of homeland security to perform responsibilities relating to homeland security second the bassnorwood amendment which would permit petitioning the secretary for reimbursement for expenses in this regard is fiscally responsible it would not for example permit grant recipients to use covered grant funds to supplant routine state or local government expenses it does not permit for example reimbursement for personnel costs the bassnorwood amendment is als6 properly targeted in scope states and localities may defray the costs of their assumed homeland security duties only with the consent of the secretary of homeland security and states and localities that have assumed these kinds of duties have to have done so pursuant to an agreement with a federal agency the federal government in my view should encourage states and localities to assist the federal government in providing security where it would otherwise be lacking and that is what this amendment is going to help us do to support this policy it is incumbent upon congress to permit state and local governments to petition the secretary for reimbursement the bassnorwood amendment is consistent with other provisions of this bill specifically h r 1544 the underlying bill permits covered grant recipients to satisfy the matching requirements through inkind contributions of goods or services or other equipment fuel maintenance personnel overtime and other costs that are associated with state and local assumption of federal terrorism preparedness duties for all of these reasons i strongly support the bassnorwood amendment i congratulate its authors for presenting it before the

you to yieldin a committee debate say no and i said why isnt that rude he says well you have never been in a debate with barney frank have you well sure enough 6 months in i say something and the ranking member asks me to yield and as a new member i mistakenly said yes i will not make that mistake going forward the gentleman is quite able with his arguments a harvard educated attorney i

what happens when we feel that we are doing something but we are really not doing anything with all due respect to my colleagues on the other side and their hard work which i join them in the theory of making sure that we reimburse local law enforcement agencies that have invested time in doing what is a federal agency responsibility but the 9 11 report called for more ice officers it called for more custom border protection officers and it called for a federal agency like the department of homeland security to have what it needs to carry out its duties i must point out to the members at line 10 on this particular amendment on the front page page 7 here of the overall bill it says that the secretary of homeland security may reimburse state and political subdivisions for the expenses that are carried out in this subsection now i am going to tell you right now this is the kind of language and i want to make sure the law enforcement communities understand this that this is not a guaranteed reimbursement we are not guai anteeing them that they are going to be reimbursed so i want to make sure the members understand that wholeheartedly i understand the intent of this amendment but i believe that if we are going to run let us run if we are going to walk let us walk but let us not jog on an issue such as this i believe that that language should say shall if we are going to come to the floor and say we are going to reimburse local subdivisions and state law enforcement agencies"]]}
