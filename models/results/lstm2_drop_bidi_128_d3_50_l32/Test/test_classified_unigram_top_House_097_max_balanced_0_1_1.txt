example of 300 000 americans that are in germany alone in europe where i feel that the continuing situation unaddressed is a constant threat to their wellbeing safety and stability and also to reexamine our role obviously the manifestations in europe should be troubling to us for they indicate that there is more concern about our presence and that our troops are looked upon not as defense troops but troops of occupation without a comparable fear to the reason why our troops are there to begin with which is to insure european protection but there seems to be more concern about american presence than russian threat yet onehalf of our defense budget or better 100 billionplus is being dedicated by the american taxpayers for the purposes of the defense of europe so for that reason i

preventative medicine policy recently my mother underwent a triple bypass surgical operation at johns hopkins university she is alive today because of the medical research that was done at one point

because of this research the biomedical cuts in heart and stroke research is compelling enough to defeat the broyhill substitute however i am not naive to believe that everybody working under contracts from the national institutes of health are idealistic and would be noble prize winners during extensive hearings held before our committee we saw that there was extensive fraud waste and abuse in the scientific field and s a result good guy scientists were being robbed of the moneys that were needed because of faulty protocols lousy monitoring and either the inability or the lack of will from the national institutes of health to bring that under some type of discipline right now there are cases pending on scientific fraud violations of asic protocols that have taken over 4 years to rectify the broyhill substitute totally eliminates the provision for providing more effective response to reports of scientific fraud we need to act promptly and the waxman bill provides no 1 the statutory authority to set up a fraud and abuse unit within the national institutes of health to deal with this problem it also provides the ii18077 h 8078 mechanism to do that and a very clear

offered this amendment last year to the labor department appropriation bill to provide needed regulatory relief to a variety of small businesses regulated presently byp the mine safety and health administration the purpose of my amendment was to deny funcl to msha to enforce its inflexible rules and regulations against certain industriesnamely the sand gravel crushed stone clay and colloidal phosphate industriesand thereby effect their transfer to the regulatory jurisdiction of osha let me stress that these industries were not to be left unregulated but would have been transferred at their request to osha which has certainly not been traditionally considered a patsy for the business community this amendment was subsequently adopted by the house and later added by the senate to the continuing resolution which would fund msha for fiscal year 1981 unfortunately during the fight over the congressional pay raise issue the amendment was lost along with a hundred other amendments and therefore did not become law decpite the overwhelming congressional supportboth in the house and in the senate i am today offering this amendment my amendment accomplishes the objectives of a bill currently cosponsored by 153 members of this body h r 1603 h r 1603 and other similar bills have languished in the health and safety subcommittee of the education and labor committee in the 96th congress and now in the 97th congress despite the great support this legislation has from many many members of congress congressmen marlenee and barnardthe principal sponsors of h r 1603 join me in urging your support for my amendment which is necessitated because of inaction by the committee having jurisdiction over h r 1603 two years ago the appropriations committee included language to deny msha funds to enforce complicated and in many instances irrelevant training requirements against these same industries i am pleased to note that prohibition has been continued in the proposal pending before the house today while our action on the training requirements has helped these industries there is still a desperate need for further congressional action my amendment makes it clear that we intend for osha to exercise jurisdiction over not only training of employees working in these industfies but have total responsibility for assuring a safe and healthful workplace the industries i am seeking to have transferred from msha to osha were made subject to the mine safety and health act by the amendments that the congress enacted in 1977 few of us recognized at that time that we were imposing sophisticated regulations designed for large and highly technical operations on small businesses which are located in virtually every community in our country the sand gravel and crushed stone industries the two largest industries affected by the amendment have an average number of employees per operation of 7 and 11 respectively the 1977 act has created continuing confrontations between these small businesses and the federal government this adversary relationship is to no ones benefit the transfer proposed in my amendment will restore a cooperative relationship between federal safety and health experts and the industries for the benefit of the workers the industries which would be transferred are not hazardous industries as their current safety records demonstrate and our acceptance therefore of this amendment will not provide any less safety and health protection to their employees some of my colleagues have suggested that the relief sought by these industries can be administratively accomplished by the mine safety and health administration to date the only significant administrative relief and possibly all that is available under the constraints of the act has come from the socalled compliance assistance visit program which allows msha inspectors to examine an oper ation that has been closed due to seasonal conditions and provide a citation and penalty free inspection prior to its reopening this limited and courtesy inspection is in sharp contrast to oshas program where an operator can request such an inspection at any time the problem is that the 1977 mine safety amendments act leaves the secretary of labor with very little flexibility in providing such relief thus underscoring the necessity for passage of my amendment it is regrettable that this serious regulatory problem which has been the subject of 21 days of hearings in the last congress must be addressed by means of an appropriations rider here today hopefully passage of my amendment will force full house consideration of legislationspecifically h r 1603in the near future to make permanent the changes my amendment would make here today for 1982 what is the actual effect of my amendment my amendment simply provides that the regulation of persons engaged in the surface mining of stone clay colloidal phosphate sand or gravel or with respect to any person engaged in construction activities on the surface area of any coal or other mine for safety purposes is transferred from msha to osha one question often asked about this amendment is does the msha amendment create a void in federal enforcement of safety and health standards over the surface mining of sand gravel stone clay colloidal phosphate as well as surface mining construction no osha under the occupational safety and health act has jurisdiction over these mines osha by its terms applies to all employers engaged in a business affecting comoctober 6 1 981 coi merce title 29 united states code section 652 5 thus osha legally covers mines which are also covered under the mine and safety and health act of 1977 additionally the drafters of osha realized that there was the potential problem of dual regulation thus they included in the act a deferral provision title 29 united states code section 653 b 1 it provides that where another federal agency exercises its own statutory authority to prescribe or enforce occupational safety or health standards then osha will not apply the legislative history of osha shows that the key factor triggering deferral is the exercise of another agencys statutory authority over them in three separate court cases three courts of appeals in our country which incidently are the courts next in authority to the unitedstates supreme court it was held that osha has jurisdiction when any other agency for example federal railroad administration msha et ceterais deprived of their jurisdiction the appropriations limitation has the effect of not providing funding for fiscal year 1982 for the exercise of mshas statutory authority over the surface mines described in the pending amendment thus there will be no exercise of statutory authority by msha the effect of this nonexercise under section 4 b 1 of oshatitle 29 united states code section 653 b 1 thus triggers by operation of existing law the responsibility of osha to assume enforcement activity over the described surface mines let me talk for a minute about the construction industry the construction industry was and still is specifically under osha jurisdiction for safety and health in fact in 1973 the construction industry initiated the call for a single standard separate and apart from the general industry osha standards so that the specific concerns of the construction industry could be adequately addressed this was done on the basis of a study which pointed out the shortcomings overlaps and voids between the general industry and the construction series of osha standards this step published in the federal register in 1979 is an example of longterm cooperation between the construction industry and osha and dedication to a mutual goalsafety with practicability unfortunately those construction contractors worfring on a suirface mine sites are considered to be miners and fall under mshas rules and regulations these socalled miners may be constructing a scale house a garage a new shop building or a structure to house a processing plant biut under the 1977 mine safety and health act they are considered miners ajid they are now subject to rules and regulations established for miners in addition to construction rufles and regulations found under osha let me give you a specific example a construction firm is planning on building a highway along the rightofway the contractor negotiates with a farmer or a rancher for the purchase of stone sand or gravel from a borrow pit on his property suddenly the farmer has become a mineowner and the contractor has become a mine operator this is the result of the msha ruling one day the contractor may greet an osha compliance officer performing an inspection of the site the next day he may find an msha enforcement officer at the gate neither operate under the same rules nor do they use the same or cven similar citations of penalties the contractor must take time from his schedule to accompany each of these federal officials during their inspections or have one of his supervisors do so in addition the contractor must also permit theemployee representative to join the entourageall at the contractors expense this situation is clearly absurd if we are truly serious about budget cuts and cutting down on truly excess federal expenditures then we should be saying you cannot send two inspectors to the same jobsite because there is no reason to pay two people to do one job there is an interagency agreement between the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration which should reduce some of the existing problems however all such memorandums of understanding have a degree of fragility about them in that they commit only those signatory to the document nnd for an unspecified period furthir the agreement reclassifies as mining some operations which have traditionally been regarded as construction it suggests that whenever a construction contractor uses equipment to process or size material which he alone is responsible for excavating he must be covered by the requirements of msha compelling the contractor to provide 24 hours of superfluous training prior to 1 ounce of productive effort from his work force again this cost spiral is all too obvious one construction industry group surveyed its members to get some idea of the cost impact of msha on the construction industry the most conservative estimates of cost impact of msha on the nations highway program place the increase at 1 percent that 1 percent comes to 300 million per year this is only a part of the problem what about the building contractors who purchase their stone sand gravel aggregates cement concrete brick and so forth from suppliers members of the construction industry report that the~r material suppliers costs would increase anywhere from 5 to 10 percent these increases are completely unnecessary one member of the industry stated if the huge msha staff went to the underground mines to work at the mining problem instead of cluttering up the surface landscape with wasteful duplicative efforts we would all benefit now i would like to address those who say that nsha is doing a terrific job and it is changing its waysbecoming more and more receptive i say that msha has not turned over a new leaf the agency and its supporters are making inaccurate statements about its socalled new look that the situations brought to our attention by constituents with stone sand gravel and clay operations as well as surface construction activities have not been resolved conditions have not improved to any appreciable degree during the 96th congress hearings were held on this issue in the house and despite consistent overwhelming testimony from all elements of the noncoalmining industrythese hearings are slated to continue ad finitum with the committee in the house showing no inclination to take action toward resolving the injustices found not just in the administration of the actbut in the act itself certainly there is always need in every industry and service to continually improve safety and health conditions but the policeman approach of msha is not the answer it appears methods of aggravation are the product not constructive efforts to better safety it is now time to resolve this matterif at least only for a year the senate subcommittee on labor has voted out s 351 which would authorize this change in the msha legislation the senate has also indicated that they will include my amendment in their version of the laborhealth education appropriations bill for fiscal year 1982 i urge support for this amendment to remove the stone clay sand gravel and surface mining construction from the heavy foot of msha to osha i urge the support

services and benefits provided in the continuing budget resolution which cleared the congress december 10 1981 while i regret the necessity for reductions made in certain programs administered by the veterans administration adequate funds have been provided so there will be no major reductions in medical care and in fact significant increases have been allowed for in entitlement programs for disabled veterans their dependents and survivors president reagan felt compelled to veto the continuing resolution passed by the congress last month but it was not because he felt that excess moncy was in the resolution for veterans benefits and services the fact is that with respect to veterans programs the second resolution is almost identical to the first the level of funding for personnel ls also the same it is my understanding that the costs of the october 1981 federal pay raise will also have no effect on the number of va employees for which appropriations have been made it is the stated intention of the appropriations commnittee that the additional costs of this pay raise will be met through deficiency appropriations in advance of the anticipated supplemental appropriation or through the use of funds other than those designated for personnel the veterans of america have fared well during a time when many other federal programs have been pared down as ranking member of the veterans affairs committee i cannot overstate the magnificent job that has been done by our distinguished chairman sonny montgomery in presenting the case for veterans with courage diligence and intelligence the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on hudindependent agencies mr boland of massachusetts has also stood steadfast in his commitment to make certain veterans programs are

spending as the most effective weapon in the ongoing war against inflation has at last received its proper priority in both the white house and on capitol hill the budget resolution recently passed by the congress and with substantial impetus provided by the reagan administration acting on its mandate from the american people correctly targeted inflation as the greatest threat to this nati ns economic health and viability that message was not lost on the public works and transportation committee when the conference report to the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 directed our committee to achieve certain savings in both its authorization and direct spending programs we more than met the level of savings recommended in the reconciliation instructions in fact the committee in a strong bipartisan approach responded to the dollar targets set in the conference report by submitting recommendations containing 28 million of added savings in budgetary authority and over 400 million in outlays in accordance with budget committee guidelines the committee recommended no specific legislative changes for fiscal years 1983 and 1984 since reductions assumed by the budget resolution of the out years were for programs not presently authorized beyond fiscal year 1982 however the committee clearly and strongly expressed its commitment to achieve the recommended out year reductions when its programs come up for reauthorization in exceeding the aggregate savings directed by the budget resolution our committee complied with both the letter and the spirit of the savings directives it received while at the same time recognizing the expertise of the committee to make the necessary decisions on any programmatic changes i might say at this point that savings achieved by the public works and transportation committee in its recommendations to the budget committee were not reached without substantial discussion and some hard decisions on highly significant programs of great impact throughout the nation in making the necessary decisions on these programs our committee sought and achieved a careful balance between the essential spending reductions and the needs of vital programs in that regard the committee stressed the need to provide funding sufficient to those public works investment programs so essential to president reagans goal of national economic revitalization savings in specific programs were achieved in the following areas under public works and transportation committee jurisdiction in aviation the committee achieved a 139 million savings with 650 million cap in fiscal year 1982 budget authority for the airport development and noise abatement programs a figure substantially below the 789 million set by the congressional budget office even as we make the necessary decisions to reduce funding for aviation programs we must continue to protect our valuable capital investment in airports and air traffic control systems if we expect to meet projected increases in air traffic growth likewise the nations capital investment in its highway and public transit systems so essential to any plans for industrial revitalization must continue to receive high priorities in its recommendations to the budget committee our committee put an 8 2 million limitation for fiscal year 1982 on obligations for federalaid highway and highway safety construction programs excluding those for emergency relief and three emergency bridge projects consequently outlays for the federalaid highway program would be reduced by 500 million as compared to the budget resolution assumption of only 185 million in outlay savings in the area of highway safety the committees reconciliation proposal reduces total budget authority available for highway safety programs in fiscal year 1982 by 308 million the committee also proposed a 110 million obligation ceiling on highway safety programs in the next fiscal year budget authority for public mass transportation was reduced by the committee from that provided in the urban mass transportation act to levels anticipated by the budget resolution thus the committee achieved a 1 321 million savings in budget authority and an anticipated 200 million outlay savings in fiscal year 1982 in water pollution control programs the committee complied with the budget resolution conference reports assumption and recommended deleting the 5 billion now authorized for the environmental protection agencys construction grants program which assists municipalities in constructing publicly owned sewage treatment plants however the committee proposed a 100 million authorization to insure that states will be able to continue administering those portions of the program delegated to them for epas nonenergy research and development programs and for abatement control and compliance activities in fiscal year 1982 the committee recommended a 540 million authorization 209 million less than the amount in the congressional budget office baseline the committee recommended that funds for construction of corps of engineers water resources projects not exceed 1 588 million in fiscal year 1982 representing a reduction of 20 million more than assumed in the conference report funding for all programs authorized by the 1965 public works and economic development act were reduced in the committees recommendations from 1 070 million to 360 million we further recommended that programs authorized by the appalachian regional development act be cut from 358 million to 215 million and that title v regional action planning commissions authorized under the 1965 public works and economic development act be eliminated it is my understanding that the latta

former complaint that the courts do not properly enforce laws and the latter argue that the laws are too poorly written and vague to enforce properly the solution is to increase contacts between
