urgency because without action bondholders will be paid but teachers cops and nurses wont i want to continue today and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente y el comisionado residente no puede ver esta crisis como una herramienta en sus campanias para un puesto mis alto el congreso s6lo ayudari a puerto rico siempre y cuando haya un llamado constante y persistente de los puertorriquehos exigiendo que el congreso cumpla y los puertorriquehlos tienen que indicar lo que esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el pueblo debe decirle a wall street que puerto rico no es una tienda para ser pirateada y que el pueblo de puerto rico no esperari a morir de hambre mientras wall street cuenta sus ganancias si wall street esti comprando bonos con descuentos deben ser pagados con descuentos pero sobre todo tenemos que trabajar juntos por el bien de puerto rico y no podemos dejar que las divisiones politicas sobre la estadidad nos dividan me comprometo como siempre lo he hecho a poner a un lado mis propios sentimientos sobre el estatus de puerto rico y a trabajar con otros puertorriquefios en el congreso y otros lideres en los dos partidos que est6n dispuestos a ayudarnos

helpful if we looked at the statements he made about the vast amount of crime in america disproportionately being committed by people who are illegally in the united states first the white house spokesman said it includedand he is talking about the presidents bill and how if the house had passed that then all our problems are over and he said about the presidents bill it included a historic investment in border security well let me help obviously he is just not up on what the law said he hadnt read it as i had but what it did is it set forward a plan to have a plan made by homeland security within so many months it has been a good while since i looked at it but they had all kinds of time to put together a plan and then that would be looked at by gao the government accountability office as i recall and then they had so much time a vast amount of time to analyze that to see if the situational awareness and occupational control would be adequate under the plan that was being proposed by homeland security the very people that have not secured the border so far and then as time went on i believe at the end of 5 years it got really serious if the border occupational control and situational awareness were not adequate then there was a real tough penalty and that was that the i believe it was secretary of homeland security had to give a report on why it was not adequately controlled look the senate bill was a disaster it did nothing to control our border it was the same kind of gobbledygook we have been dealing with for quite some time from the white house and we have said consistently as republicans in this house most of us if the president will secure the border we will pass an immigration bill that takes care of everything else it is pretty basic secure the border then we will deal with the people that are here illegally until the border is secured then you are going to keep having people like juan francisco lopezsanchez coming back across so it wont matter how expansive a bill is and how much situational awareness there is on our borders or in our country it wont matter because people like mr lopezsanchez will keep coming back we have got to have border security that is all there is to it once the border is secure we can work everything else out and i pointed out many times what i have learned on the border what i have heard repeatedly from our immigration officers our border patrolmen that they are not allowed to properly secure the border we had this massive influx of people coming in and apparently it is expected to grow some more again this year but we are not securing the border we let them come in and once they are on our side of the border then we go ahead and ship them off this had been going on for some time one of the border patrolmen told me that among the drug cartels and the gangs in mexico the homeland security department is called logistics after the commercial i forget if it is fedex or ups one of them that say hey we are the logistics you give us your package and then we get it wherever you want it to go i asked just in the last couple of weeks the secretary of homeland security are you still shipping people all over the place i didnt get an adequate answer i am afraid the answer is there is still the logistics we wont stop you at the border if you come across the river we are not going to have people out there at the river to stop you from coming onto united states property now we are going to let you get onto united states property and then we are going to take you where you need to go you may have to stay in a facility here or there thats the kind of thing that was going on that was luring more and more people and as the border patrolmen multiple told me chris crane has testified about himself that every time somebody in washington talks about amnesty talks about legalizing people that are here it becomes a massive draw a lure to people to come into this country illegally that lures people to their deaths it lures young girls into situations where they end up being sex slaves we are told that the sex trafficking is horrendous and that young girls coming up here are often raped on the way by the gangs bringing them and as one border patrolman had said since he was hispanic and he spoke better spanish than many of the people coming across he would ask them the question they are required to ask about why did you come to america and 90 percent of the time he said they would say to get away from gang violence he would say in spanish hey some gringo may accept that but you and i both know you paid a gang some gang to bring you up here so dont be telling me you came to get away from the gangs you used a gang to get here and 90 percent of the time their responses were well yeah that is true but we were told to say we are getting away from gang violence well the spokesperson for the white house also said about the senate bill it would also have ramped up interior enforcement of immigration laws against dangerous individuals well in juan francisco lopezsanchez case the immigration laws were being enforced to some extent not completely but to some extent he had been to prison a number of times he violated the immigration laws and had illegal reentry been deported five times so at least on five occasions the interior enforcement was happening the issue was that the bureau of prisons released him to a sanctuary city of san francisco and not to ice and san francisco released him then to walk freely so even if we followed the white house advice and ramped up interior enforcement which clearly this administration has no intention whatsoever of doingand i have stories to back that up shortlythen it would not have changed in all likelihood the outcome of that case for those who are tempted to say you are making a big deal about one case where a sweet young daughter was shot dead by somebody deported five times a criminal a felon multipletime felon but it is not that big a deal well it is a big deal just recently we had an article the 7th of july of this year written by caroline may headline illegal immigrants accounted for nearly 37 percent of federal sentences in fy 2014 according to fiscal year 2014 ussc data of 74 911 sentencing cases citizens accounted for 43 479 or 58 percent illegal immigrants accounted for 27 505 or 36 7 percent and legal immigrants made up for 4 percent of those sentences as far as drug trafficking illegal immigrants represented 16 8 percent of all drug trafficking cases they represented 20 percent of the kidnapping and hostage taking cases they represented 74 1 percent of the drug possession cases 12 3 percent of money laundering cases and 12 percent of murder convictions of the federal murder convictions in america 12 percent would not have happened since this president has taken office there are thousands of people who would not have been murdered if we enforced our immigration laws and had a secure border it is not just this precious girl in san francisco it is not a race issue there are hispanics being killed there are hispanics being taken hostage there are hispanics being raped there are whites blacks asiansyou name it they are victims of illegal immigrant criminal activity it is absolutely outrageous for anyone in a government position to belittle thousands of people being murdered raped kidnapped and to be so cavalier about it the white house says well the bill that they were plugging for would have enhanced penalties for repeat immigration violators with sentences up to 20 years for certain illegal aliens who were convicted of felonies look there were laws in place and they were violated he had been to prison until you secure the border people like mr lopezsanchez are going to keep coming back you have to secure the border he also said the bill would have increased penalties for passport and immigration document trafficking and fraud yes like that would have stopped him he came back across illegally five times it wasnt a passport issue it is just pretty dramatic what kind of things have occurred i also filed a bill todaywe have got some cosponsorsregarding the district of columbia the district of columbia by authority of the constitution was empowered to congress we set up local control some would say well wait a minute if you are trying to punish a sanctuary city like the district of columbia the only real federal city in the country the only real city under congressional constitutional control why dont you just leave it to the locals we did and the local officials allowed it to become a sanctuary city that was not enforcing the law so the bill that was passed today wasnt near as tough as i felt like it should have been it wasnt near as tough of a bill as the king amendment had been that we had previously passed with plenty of votes we could have passed it again today but that is not the bill that was brought it is a good first step it is a step in the right direction that is why i ended up voting for it even though it was not as strong as the original king amendment it is important to avoid having sanctuaries refuges for people who are felons like the man who killed kate steinle then we have this story from july 22 by elizabeth harrington it points out that the obama administration is not only planning on not enforcing the law despite all the hogwash coming out of the white house press room and not only are they not going to enforce the law but here is what is coming out the article points out the obama administration is moving forward with plans to expand a waiver program that will allow additional illegal aliens to remain in the country rather than apply for legal status from abroad the department of homeland security issued a proposed rule on tuesday that would make changes to a waiver program created by president barack obamas executive action on immigration in 2013 unconstitutional as it was the action created a waiver that primarily allowed illegal immigrants with a unitedstates citizen spouse or parent to stay and it goes into the specifics the new rule expands eligibility to a host of other categories of illegal immigrants jessica vaughan director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies said its a very bad policy it makes it possible for illegal aliens to avoid the consequences established by congress to deter people from settling here illegally and then laundering their status by adjusting to a green card vaughan who has been following the issue for over 2 years said the changes to the waiver program would increase fraud it is a slap in the face to the many legal immigrants who abide by the law follow the process and wait their turn she said in addition it will increase the likelihood of fraud in the marriage categories which produce tens of thousands of new green cards each year the president should not be issuing executive actions that serve only to expedite the legalization process for those who have ignored our laws this legalization gimmick is undermining the integrity of our legal immigration system and congress should take steps to block it the public will have 60 days to comment on the proposal it appears to be yet another unconstitutional act by our president still seeming to thumb his nose at the judge in south texas who had put an injunction on the last amnesty that was issued by the president so they are just going to keep going apparently this article by julia preston has a title from the new york times most undocumented immigrants will stay under obamas new policies report says under new immigration enforcement programs the obama administration is putting in place across the country the vast majority of unauthorized immigrantsup to 87 percentwould not be the focus of deportation operations and would have a degree of protection to remain in the united states according to a report published thursday by the migration policy institute the report found that about 13 percent of an estimated 11 million immigrants without papers or about 1 4 million people have criminal records or recently crossed the border illegally making them priorities for deportation under guidelines the administration announced in november it makes it very clear that there is so much disingenuousness coming out of the white house oh yes if we had passed this ridiculous bill that the senate passed which really was not going to address the issue of enforcement adequately we were going to have studies and plans if it did not work in 5 years heck we would let the secretary give us a report on why it didnt all work i mean it is absurd secure the border it is very basic the president has got the power and he has got the money heck they just blew off the 4 billion virtual fence a few years ago that we had appropriated money for what are they doing with that money why havent they secured the border with that they could do it just when you think news about people acting illegally and being given amnesty couldnt get much worse this story by steven green on july 20 by pj media reads

incredible we are told we have seen the deal oh yes there are parts like the iaea has got to work out its side deal that we dont see here in congress but it is a good deal lets not forget my friend who spoke last from the other side of the aisle was talking about how great the doddfrank bill is let me just say this quickly about that as for the doddfrank bill that was passed supposedly to punish those evil investment banks on wall street what has it really done it has punished the community banks that didnt do anything wrong they werent invested in mortgagebacked securities they werent doing all kinds of machinations to try to create new forms of legalized gambling on wall street they werent engaged in that yet doddfrank has so punished community banks that every month there are fewer community banks they are getting gobbled up by the guys who caused the problems that is what doddfrank did it added so much expense and burden on the local banks and it provided a lot of benefits to the biggest banks they are the ones that could absorb the parts of the law we are losing banks constantly as far as the great economic news we know we have at least 93plus million people for the first time in our history94 million people maybe nowwho have given up looking for jobs it has never gotten that high before it had gotten close once before i think under carter but it has never gotten this high before people have just given up looking for jobs you have got more on food stamps than ever before is that really something to be proud of it is if you want indentured servitude of the people of the united states the middle class we hear now recently is growing smaller the gap between the ultra rich and the poor is growing bigger under this presidents redistribution model because it doesnt work the most troubling economic statistic that anybody should have been seeing over the last few yearsover the last 2 yearscame out in 2013 that under president obama for the first time in american historyever95 percent of all of the income went to the top 1 percent income earners it still bothers me greatly but i read actually that even though the top 1 percent is making 95 percent of all the income it was a slower growth to them than in the last two expansions so it really was not that great of news for them well it isnt great for america when 95 percent of the income is made by the top 1 percent it is just this wink and nod with wall street from this administration of we are going to call you fat cats we are going to punish you we are going to hit you with doddfrank and what happens you kill the smaller banks you hurt the middle class you overburden the middle class you make it more difficult for them to live more people end up on food stamps it is a disaster that is why it was no surprise in the last couple of days when we saw a report that there is a great majority of americans who feels like this president has hurt the economy more than he has helped it i dont know that that is true but i do know that more people according to the poll are saying that capital markets and wall street oh they have done well yes that is what happens when we create more money than at any time in american history we are creating money notice i am saying creating money because i learned it was improper to say we are printing more money than ever before i was told by someone with the fedsome years back when i asked how much more money are we printing than we have ever printed oh none really but there is more money in the system oh yes we couldnt possibly print all of the money we are creating are you kidding me we are just adding numbers we arent even bothering to print it anymore as we are increasing money so fast it is an outrage what has happened the bottom line is americans are suffering government does not make things better it is better when they get a job not more food stamps it is time that we knock doddfrank down to size where it does deal with the investment banks that caused the problem of 2008 and doesnt punish the banks that didnt get us in that trouble in the time i have left i have just got to go back to this horrendous iranian deal it is putting the united states and all freedomloving people at risk iran cannot be trusted and i am still concerned about the language like if you say in a bill or in the iran agreement oh yes you cant use icbms or develop them for 8 years or at the broader conclusion of the iaeas that nuclear material is being used for peaceful purposes whichever is earlier that concerns me about the 8year requirement is it really an 8year requirement seriously i mean what does that mean i went down and cleared that that was not classified so i could speak of that there are a few places where i have seen that that language the broader conclusion by the iaea holy cow that is completely out of our control that is one of the time deadlines that some of the important timing can be iran continues to make clear as this story from july 12 from adam kredo says that iran is saying we will trample upon america iranian cleric ayatollah mohammad ali movahedi kermani who was handpicked by the islamic republics supreme leader to deliver the prayers delivered a message of hostility toward the united states in the first official remarks since a final nuclear deal was signed between iran and world powers in vienna last week analysts who spoke to the washington free beacon about the antiamerican tone of last weeks prayers said it is a sign tehran believes it bested the united states in the talks you think the article further down says irans defense minister on monday said the deal also will prohibit all foreigners from inspecting irans defensive and missile capabilities at sensitive military sites you dont have to have my sat scores to know they are going to be classifying as many sites as they can as defensive sites that we cannot have inspected it is time to say no to the deal americans need to rise up and

industry in alaska is the largest private sector employer in my state yet the approval of a genetically engineered ge salmon or frankenfish as i call it could put our thriving and iconic fishing sector in jeopardy frankenfish could pose a grave threat to our wild salmon stocks in alaska and the food and drug administrations fda support for approving ge salmon is disturbing equally disturbing is the fact that if approved the fda has said that it would not require ge salmon to be labeled in todays global marketplace a consumers access to accurate ingredient information is paramount clear and accurate ge labeling requirements attempt to mitigate the risk of market confusion or rejection by countries that have no interest in purchasing the hybrid organism consumer confusion about what types of salmon or seafood are genetically engineered may deter shoppers from purchasing these products altogether if ge salmon is approved despite opposition from congress and nearly two million people who wrote in to the fda it should be clearly labeled to avoid the potential market rejection of all salmon in an effort to ensure that alaskan consumers have this essential information alaska enacted legislation in 2005 that requires the labeling of all products containing ge fish and shellfish however the socalled safe and accurate food labeling act recently referred out of the house agriculture committee would block states like alaska from requiring mandatory labeling of ge fish while also curtailing fdas ability to craft a true national ge labeling system rather its proponents would suggest that alaskan fishermen should go through a costly nongmo certification if they want consumers to know that their salmon is not genetically engineered why should all unitedstates salmon fishermen have to prove their salmon are nongmo when farmed ge salmon coming into the unitedstates from other countries would not it is insufficient for consumers and it is insufficient for alaskas

bill which is included in this reform package requires fema to create an action plan to address inconsistent guidance inappropriate recordkeeping procedures and overall mixed assistance to local
