members who have been planning to speak on the unfunded mandate portion of the evening this is it if they are out there and they want to come over we would love to have them this is a special order and it is an important special order it is important because it deals with the most pressing issue facing states and local governments today that is beginning the issue of unfunded mandates as many of us know today has been designated as national unfunded mandate day a day in which local officials across the country were to begin educating the public of the devastating consequences of unfunded federal mandates i was told by the unitedstates conference of mayors which was the primary sponsor of the national unfunded mandate day that over 1 000 local officials around the nation held events in which they singled out unfunded federal mandates as the biggest problem they face in these communities the message to the congress was clear stop approving legislation that imposes requirements on local governments without containing the resources necessary to carry out that mandate this august i and a number of members of congress have formed the congressional caucus on unfunded mandates in order to bring together members of congress who agree that this body must honestly address this issue since august we have 84 members of the congress who have joined the caucus on unfunded mandates as anybody who knows me can attest i am not a frequent participant in special orders however i feel that this issue is so important to our nation that it deserves the topic of discussion on the house floor in addition i feel that a special order devoted solely to unfunded federal mandates is appropriate activity for national unfunded mandate day i am proud to join with my colleagues and local government across this country to try to educate congress and the american people about unfunded mandates unfunded mandates is what we call in the business feel good legislation that is where we in congress get to feel good and pass the cost on to local governments we have got to put a stop to that there are a group of members of congress who have come together to try to find a bipartisan solution this is a bipartisan issue democrats and republicans have come together to try to come to a consensus about how we deal with the unfunded federal mandate issue and we do have limited time this evening i would like to share with my colleagues some profiles of cities that are being adversely affected by unfunded federal mandates for instance the city of phoenix az could provide substantially lower water and sewer rates to its citizens if they did not have to commit much of their local revenue to unfunded mandates in fresno ca the city estimated the costs of closing a landfill without federal mandates to be 10 to 12 million however because the landfill is included as a supedund site the cost of closing the facility will range from 35 to 60 million you should note that all of the costs will be borne by the citys solid waste rate payers in los angeles unfunded mandates will have a detrimental impact on the citys ability to provide essential swvices mayor richard riordan has told me that he could put many more cops on the streets if the city did not have to comply with so many unfunded federal mandates in philadelphia an environmental protection agency requirement that the city develop an advanced wastewater treatment system to inprove the oxygen levels for fish in the delaware water basin will cost philadelphia upwards of 500 million the mayor of philadelphia ed rendell has told me that he will not comply with this mandate because there is no way that he can justify this expenditure to the citizens of philadelphia merced ca located in my congressional district will incur 1 4 million in unfunded federal mandates in 199394 in order to balance this years budget merced had to cut over 30 staff positions remember merced only has a population of 53 000 people and it is suffering in the worst sort of way because of unfunded federal mandates in modesto ca also in my congressional district the city will spend 5 8 million on nine federal mandates over the next 6 years this money could be used to hire 150 police officers in stockton ca the san joaquin county district attorney was contemplating laying off onequarter of his prosecutors because of unfunded mandates however a temporary extension of the 1cent sales tax surcharge allowed the county to retain its prosecutors nevertheless if a permanent solution is not found the da will be forced to let these prosecutors go thus leaving the citizens of san joaquin county unprotected from crime in california the classic example of an unfunded federal mandate is immigration our immigration policy is solely the province of the federal government congress and the administration determine who may enter this country and to a great extent they determine where these immigrants reside however the state of california and its counties are responsible for the education health and welfare of these people for this year governor wilson has stated that providing social services to these people will cost the state at least 1 4 billion it should be clear to those listening to this debate that unfunded federal mandates are a problem what can we do in congress to mitigate the problems of unfunded federal mandates well we can prevent future unfunded federal mandates from being enacted since last year i have tried to offer floor amendments to any legislation considered by the house that contains unfunded mandates last congress the house considered the voting rights language assistance act of 1992 this legislation mandated that states and local jurisdictions containing large minorty populations print voting materials in the native language of those groups this mandate will no doubt increase the normal costs of running elections when the voting rights language assistance act of 1992 was considered on the house floor i offered an amendment that would have required the federal government to reimburse local governments for the increased costs due to this mandate unfortunately my amendment was defeated by two votes this congress i wanted to offer a similar amendment to the national voter registration act more commonly referred to as motorvoter it was estimated that motorvoter would cost my state of califomia 26 million a year the congressional budget office estimated the cost of compliance for all of the states to be 200 million unfortunately the rules committee did not allow my amendment to be offered and the congress went ahead and pushed another unfunded mandate onto the states last week i along with congressman goodling offered an amendment to the education goals 2000 that clarified that the bill would not become an unfunded mandate on states and school districts i am proud that our amendment was unanimously approved by the full house it is my full intention to continue offering these sorts of amendments to unfunded mandates that make their way to th house floor i would appreciate the assistance of my colleagues in this endeavor besides offering floor amendments i believe that this body needs to consider specific mandate relief legislation to that end i dave introduced h r 140 the federal mandate relief act of 1993 my bill is very simple it merely states that compliance with or implementation of an unfunded federal mandate is voluntary for states and localities until the federal govemiment provides the funding needed to pay for the mandated requirements the bill is not retroactive and would only apply to mandates which take effect on or after the date of enactment by requiring the federal government to put up the money before it can enforce any future mandates my bill accomplishes exactly what local governments are requesting that is why h r 140 has been endorsed by the unitedstates conference of mayors the national association of counties the national league of cites the national association of towns and townships the national conference of state legislatures the council of state governments and the national taxpayers union currently h r 140 enjoys the support of 108 members of congress i hope that my colleagues who are not cosponsors of h r 140 will take a look at the legislation and consider

where often the poorest live they are in the city neighborhoods they are in the most isolated rural areas they are where the people who have the least access to health care live and furthermore even

associate myself with the remarks just given by my friend the gentleman from florida the president should appeal that decision last week i was one of just 21 members of my party to vote against the legislative appropriations bill that was considered on the floor of this house why did i do that there were two reasons first i do not believe that bill cuts spending nearly enough yes it cuts some spending it outs some spending over in the gao and it cuts some spending in some special committees that no longer exist but it did not cut into the real waste of the legislative branch and that is the committee staff which is far too large two months ago i was one of just three members of my party who voted for a republican proposal that would have cut committee staff by 25 percent across the board that is what i think serious spending cuts should be the second reason i voted against that bill was simply this we need to restore our credibility with the american people now even a 25percent cut in congressional committee staff spending would not approach eliminating the federal budget deficit but it might help us eliminate some of the cynicism and some of the skepticism that are all too pervasive throughout america i know that every time i stand before my constituents in florida when they look at me even though i have been here just 2 years and a few months they see before them the

excuse for not believing that the choices we face as a nation truly are difficult we have been lied to and deceived for far too long we have had politicians in positions of public responsibility democrats and republicans alike tell the people that the hard choices are not really necessary they say we can eliminate the federal budget deficit just by eliminating foreign aid or maybe my salary which by the way i voted to freeze a few months ago they say that the choices are really easy they are not hard at all they have been told there is some separate category of federal spending called fraud and waste that we could just cut that and eliminate the budget deficit while not eliminating programs that people need and want and deserve that is not true hard choices must be made and we are in fact beginning to make them at long last but much more must be done to restore our credibility with the people or they simply will not believe us when we tell them that the choices are hard and

that is why a majority of this man hefleys amendment to termi house and a majority of the other body nate the eda stopped funding the loan program and the two series of eda grants con so it has been moribund all these many tained in this legislationboth the years public works and economic adjustment indeed in the legislation before us grants are vital to our efforts to re today there is no reauthorization of store economically distressed areas the loan program instead what there like the cities of paterson and passaic is is a study to be completed and a rewhich are located in my congressional port to be made to congress suggesting district in northern new jersey coin whether or not such a program can be munities like these need to have in put together and how it would avoid vestment in their infrastructure in the problems of the past order to attract new business and in i want to repeat dustry and to create more jobs for the there is no loan program such as the people who live there gentleman is talking about in this bill it is essential that we provide these there is a revolving loan program that distressed communities the support has been in existence and has worked they need to rebuild their infrastruc satisfactorily and thanks to the conture and address the longterm prob tributions of the gentleman from georlems created by economic deteriora gia that program has tion high unemployment massive been made more flexible in the nature plant closures and defense industry that i think most people think would cutbacks be important at the same time keepmany of the problems that have ing its accountability plagued the eda for the past 12 years there has been and the gentleman have been corrected in the compromise from colorado acknowlbill we have before us today we have edges this there has been significant improved upon the grant criteria we tightening up of the program to meet have improved the procedures for proc some of the complaints that have been essing applications we have clearly de made over the past dozen years for infined edas mission and we have made stance whereas the eda was often sure that applicants who receive eda criticized for applying being able to moneys have established longterm apply to 80 percent of the country strategies to best address local eco today it would be 45 percent of the nomic problems country with the new criteria this legislation is a modest investment in americas future and it deserves your support 0 1120 i want to thank chairman kanijorski there is a simplified for all his efforts to bring this com application process and so that we do not have to make many of these communities jump through hoops something that i though was important was that the eda university centers are now required to be evaluated once every 2 years to make sure that indeed they are working the loan program has been eliminated that the gentleman complained about there have been other things made as well to try and bring that greater accountability to the eda i would urge members to reject this the gentleman from new york eloquently spoke about the regional director in philadelphia mr corrigan who i also find to be the finest in the eda tradition i inight point out that he was brought to washington under republican administrations to assist there was a high degree of professionalism maintained through various administrations and indeed one of the best eda administrators that i ran into was bonnie newman appointed under the reagan administration who disagreed with the program but said it is my job to run it and to run it effectively the eda has continued to assist those communities on a bipartisan or better said nonpartisan basis i would just urge members to reject this amendment and to do so overwhelmingly in fact i think it is a statement to the strength of the eda the bipartisan debate we have heard in favor of retaining the eda i would urge that because every one of us has a situation that we can recount about the eda how many of my colleagues have had to deal with natural disasters and unfortunately we can never tell when we are going to have to deal with a natural disaster in florida in california in hawaii in my own state of west virginia in 1985 how many of my colleagues are having to deal presently with the pain of defense closings a military base closing a realignment or the significant downsizing of a defense plant edas role has increased significantly to adapt with that how many of my colleagues are trying to put together that deal that will bring 200 300 maybe 1 000 jobs to their area to a hard hit economically devastated area and need just that final linchpin and the final linchpin could be a water system or a sewer system that is eda it puts it together it makes it happen i would urge rejection of this amendment and i am going to repeat something i said yesterday"], [0.00028902292251586914, 0.49971097707748413, 0, "mr speakor i

ailing economy around it is my hope that that this program will mean jobs that will overcome the impat of a huge deficit and national debt there is little doabt that the people of san bernardino iayo aounties a largely rural conservative district have said time and time again to straighten out our economy we are willing to share a bit of the pain as long as it ti spread across the board equally i must tell you that as a result of the presidenas preliminary presentation on moadey night those same people who were willing to share the pain have responded with soe serious toncorns about what they think they are going to hear that is they heard from the presidents remarks that those taxpayers eating over 250 o were going to bear the burden now the president has indicated that families earning 10 n will feel the pain of new taxes they heard that the initial pain might be felt by the senior cltizens who were recipients of social security they are very concerned that maybe the presldent is redefining where he will raise the revenues necessary to carry forward this investment and indeed my constituents i can tell you and i think people across this country are waiting tonight to hear specifics from the president just how is he planning to go about cutting the rate of growth of government we are never going to handle the deficit problem unless we can got a handle on the growth of

legislation would permanently exempt state and local public safety agencies from the age discrimination in employment act in order to permit them to consider age in their hiring and retirement policies federal public safety agencies including the federal bureau of investigation and federal firefighters are already permanently exempted from the adea as a rule congress must avoid exempting whole classes of employees from the protection of civil rights laws unless it is absolutely necessary we should not carve out exemptions merely because an employer finds civil rights compliance to be costly or inconvenient exemptions must be made only when there is a strong compelling need to do so and there is no other reasonable alternative this is one of those rare instances state and local fire and police agencies must be exempted from the adea in order to protect and promote the safety of the public this is literally a life or death matter if police officers oruflrefighters cannot adequately perform their duties people die and people get hurt age does indeed affect an individuals ability to perform the duties of a public safety officer this is not a stereotype this is not ageism this is a medical fact physical ability declines with age for example aerobic capacity declines at a rate of 1 percent per year after age 30 strength declines at a rate of1013 percent every decade the risk of sudden incapacitation also clearly increases with age increasing sixfold between the age of 40 and 60 years of age these physical effects are not experienced by all people to the same degree or at the same precise time but they pose a significant problem to public safety agencies in their efforts to maintain a fit and effective work force a public safety agency can respond to agerelated declines in ability in one of two ways it can establish an agebased mandatory retirement policy this will reduce the risks to public safety but it may result in some capable individuals being forcibly retired alternatively an agency can try to use performance and physical ability testing to try to screen out employees who might pose a threat to public safety unfortunately there are numerous problems with trying to use tests as an alternative to age which makes this option untenable it is simply not possible to devise a test for all tasks carried out by a public safety employee for example no test could have possibly simulated the kinds of physical conditions firefighters in southern california have faced over the past 2 weeks no test no matter how comprehensive can measure all of the skills and abilities a public safety employee must posses moreover there is no current test that can effectively screen for the risk of sudden incapacitation among symptomatic individuals a mandatory retirement age used in conjunction with screening for their risk factors continues to be the most effective way of reducing the risk of sudden incapacitation by public safety officers another but lesser concern is that it is enormously expensive to administer performance and ability tests on a periodic basis to all public safety employees consuming scarce resources that are needed to keep police on the street in addition testing often entails considerable litigation over the content of the tests in tennessee for example there were several years of litigation over the state wildlife officers entrance exam which focused on the question of whether the fences that recruits had to scale should be 8 or 10 feet tall testing can also have a very serious negative impact on other individuals and groups that historically have been discriminated against in employment tests have been proven to have an adverse impact on women and minorities women on average are less strong than men written tests may underpredict the onthejob performance of minorities to assure that such factors did not prevent women and minorities from serving in public safety positions many agencies withingroup normed the results of certain tests unfortunately a provision of the civil rights act of 1991 now prohibits the practice of norming as a result any increase in the use of physical and mental testing of public safety employees will jeopardize employment opportunities for women and minorities for these and other reasons testing does not today represent a viable alternative to agebased mandatory retirement policies for public safety agencies under m r 2722 those agencies who wish to experiment with testing in lieu of retirement ages will be able to do so but given the uncertainty about the effectiveness effects and implications of using tests as a substitute for age the congress must not force every public safety agency to implement them this would be the case if we did not enact h r 2722 i want to emphasize that this exemption is strongly supported by the affected employees themselves if they did not support it i would not have introduced h r 2722 and the committee on education and labor would not have reported it without a single objection agebased retirement is not regarded by firefighters and police officers as unfair or as something which imposes any kind of hardship on them on the contrary they believe it is essential what is more where agencies have set mandatory retirement ages moat of the employees retire well before attaining that age those who wish to continue to work full time have no problem finding other employment this is why this legislation is strongly supported by not only the national league of cities and other public safety employers but by the fraternal order of police the international association of firefighters and other representatives of public safety employees in making this exemption from adea permanent our intent is not to forever close the door on this issue rather our objective is to ensure that when congress does reexamine this issue it does so because there are compelling reasons to take another looknot because of some arbitrary predetermined deadline i would strongly support reexamining this issue and consider amending or repealing the exemption in any of the following circumstances if there were any indicatiops that significant numbers of public safety employees considered the exemption to be unfair and unwarranted if federal public safety agencies such as the fbi and federal firefighters eliminated their agebased retirement policies or if there was compelling evidence that there were reasonable effective alternatives to the use of age which did not have an adverse impact on any class of individuals who are protected by federal civil rights laws the 1964 civil rights act the adea and other civil rights statutes have all been amended numerous times since their original enactment no special temporary provision was needed to prod congress to act in these instances permanent does not mean forever what it means is that congress will only return to this issue when there is strong support and compelling evidence for it to do so i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h r 2722 it is imperative that all public safety employees be fit effective and fully capable of fulfilling their duties this legislation will assure that state and local police and fire agencies will be able to pursue that goal using the sameagebased employment criteria which is now used by the fbi the secret service and other federal public safety agencies i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
