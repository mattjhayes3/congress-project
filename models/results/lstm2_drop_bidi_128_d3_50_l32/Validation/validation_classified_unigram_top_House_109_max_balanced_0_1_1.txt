need we really have to listen that is our job because we need to listen to our first responders and find out from them what is really going on the ground i remember i am sure you do too that one of the most significant problems that was identified that has been talked about across this country is the interoperability which is a word that is difficult to understand that means the inability for the first responders on 9 11 to communicate with each other while the event was unfolding that was one of the major major recommendations of the bipartisan 9 11 commission that we had to fund and improve the interoperability so that across all of the jurisdiction all of the intelligence and law enforcement jurisdictions that there could be communication the fbi couldnt talk to the firefighters couldnt talk to the police officers and today 5 years later that is still not in place even though it was a recommendation of the 9 11 commission and it boils down to funding you have to fund it there

center of the united states i am concerned about the burdens that regulation and reporting requirements impose on our financial institutions particularly those that are not megainstitutions but are midsized and smaller i know that the vast majority of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share this concern and we have worked together to address it in this legislation last year we passed regulatory relief by an overwhelming majority in the house but it failed in the senate i voted for that bill although i thought it could use some improvement and this bill is improved by the addition of several provisions dealing with issues that are of special concern to me such as the extraordinary burden of compliance under which our financial institutions are required to operate wherever i go in my district smaller institutions tell me how hard and costly it is to comply with the new requirements of the bank secrecy act to file currency transaction reports and to comply with the new requirements of the patriot act know your customer requirements they say these requirements in many cases are redundant and are excessively burdensome the burdens are particularly heavy for smaller institutions i worked with representative renzi to develop the language in this bill that eliminates unnecessary currency transaction reports so that banks can focus on suspicious activity reports or sars which are a much more useful tool according to law enforcement to track money laundering and terrorist financing this measure was proposed by the treasury department and law enforcement we heard from fincen the lead agency on money laundering that the masses of useless ctrs being filed impeded law enforcement and were often not even looked at and the general accounting office the independent body that reviews government activities confirmed that in a report last year also supporting streamlining the process the banking regulators also expressed strong support for this proposal occ and ots both agreed with fincen that the ctr filing process had become counterproductive in terms of national security this bill also includes other provisions relieving the unnecessary burden on community banks including increased commercial and small business lending authority for federal savings associations regulation of thrift trust activities in a manner comparable to bank trust activities and an exemption from annual privacy notice requirements for financial institutions that do not share customer information this bill also contains regulatory relief for credit unions taken from the credit union regulatory improvement act which i have cosponsored for several congresses i urge my colleagues to support this bill i look forward to the passage in this house and hopefully in the other body

remember going at it with our former colleague now the director of central intelligence porter goss he was not a strong proponent of sunset provisions at that time and isaid we are so close to the tragic day of september 11 that it is absolutely essential that we ensure that we are doing the right thing with this legislation and we are obviously passing it under the immediate shadow of

have served in the military or are willing to stand up with it the other individual i would like to thank is sylvestre reyes because he truly has served as a veteran has served in the committee and stands up for important legislation that talks about the fallen heroes act rightnow that is important for a lot of us i want to thank both of you for standing up and your leadership on behalf of all

we enjoy today a lot of them do not know what is going to happen to them but they serve with honor and dignity because they believe in the freedoms that we enjoy today and the freedoms that we will enjoy tomorrow but if a fallen hero falls we have the responsibility as americans to make sure that we protect them and that they have the right to bury their families with honor and with dignity as americans we have that responsibility because ultimately they give the sacrifice for us so that we can enjoy those freedoms those freedoms that we take for granted every day of our life whether to buy a home go to school go to college enjoy the freedom of speech enjoy whatever we need we have the same responsibility to those individuals who have fallen to the parents and the relatives to a wife or anyone else who is there i think this bill is the right thing to do because we need to respect with honor and dignity those who are willing to sacrifice for us too often we forget as we look at the flag right behind you it is a flag that we honor it is a flag that many individuals have stood for it is our veterans who have done that and when they receive that flag and many of them receive that flag it should be done with honor and dignity without any disruption of anyone picketing and too often we forget that i stand in support of this important legislation on behalf of all veterans who are willing to serve now and will serve us in the future we owe it to them and i appreciate what mr reyes has done and mr buyer has done"]]}
