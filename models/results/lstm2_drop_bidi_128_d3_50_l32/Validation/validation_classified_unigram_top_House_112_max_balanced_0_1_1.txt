employer over wages and benefits and conditions of employment is recognized as an important human right and as a hallmark of democratic societies but in the united states those rights have been under assault by some politicians and by some employers who want to turn the clock back threequarters of a century when workers want to join a union here and bargain collectively with their employer too many employers intentionally delay and delay abusing the legal system to deny their employees the rights that we scold developing nations for denying their workers i rise in support of the proposed national labor relations board rule to streamline and modernize union election procedures an important and overdue step to restore fairness to our inefficient and outdated system that has allowed too many abuses the new nlrb rule would speed up union elections giving employers less opportunity to interfere illegally with organizing drives the rule also allows smaller groups of workers to form unions under the current nlrb system employers willing to break the law have many opportunities to delay a union election stretching out the time period when they can intimidate and coerce workers all in violation of the law the effect of this rule is to help workers exercise their free choice to join and be represented by a union without illegal interference streamlining nlrb elections is a long overdue and small step to ensure workers the right to speak with one voice to a representative of their choosing but in the last week we have heard that brian hayes the only republican member of the nlrb board nlrb is threatening to resign specifically to deny the board the quorum to act under the law to deny the board the quorum to perform the duties that the law places upon them republicans in this congress have now tried to defund the nlrb to take away the nlrbs ability to impose sanctions on employers who violate the law and now they are trying to shut the board down altogether by abusing the other bodys advice and consent powers to block any new appointments to the board and by having a republican member resign specifically to deny the necessary quorum to act today we are considering the socalled workforce democracy and fairness act and despite that orwellian name the bill is designed to do the exact opposite it is intended to deny workers the right to unionize without delay and litigation to deny those rights through delay and litigation and by allowing employers to decide which employees which workers get to vote on whether there is a union or not to stuff the ballot box under this bill to add new workers to the unit that will decide whether to have a union or not under the bill there would be a waiting period if there is an election dispute whether its well grounded or frivolous a waiting period for preelection hearing a waiting period for unions to receive the better contact list and the only goal for that for those waiting periods is delay the arbitrary waiting periods ensure that election will be delayed and nowhere is there any assurance the election will really be held my republican colleagues blame frivolous lawsuits for many of the ills of our country but this bill would reward frivolous lawsuits by providing more time for employers to find fault real or fabricated with the election process and by blocking the nlrbs current rule that would allow elections to move ahead before the complaints are resolved this bill would allow employers to use litigation frivolous or legitimate to block elections finally this bill would allow employers to stuff the ballot box with a radical rewrite of our labor law so that the employer would decide which employees which workers get to vote they can add employees who were never engaged in the organizing drive and they can keep the list of voters of the workers eligible to vote from those supporting a union until just before the election american workers deserve the same rights that we urge around the world for workers the right to form a union the right to speak with one voice and bargain with their employer so that our workers can win better wages and better benefits and rebuild the american middle

epa learns about how these materials find their way into our drinking water epa is forbidden to classify or regulate it as hazardous waste epa is forbidden to require that this toxic material be disposed of carefully this bill turns a blind eye to evidence of known hazards and takes us back to the dark ages to a time before science was valued and before advanced knowledge transformed society

the bowels of the earth to rip coal from the mines and die early deaths apparently house republicans not only wish to embrace the principal energy source of the 19th century they also wish to return us to the 19thcentury principles about public health and the environment regarding arsenic and mercury and their danger to the citizens of our country now there are good uses for coal ash beneficial uses it can be used to construct highways and shingles thats good it can be mixed into concrete and grout thats good but what we dont want is for the industry to be able to use it to construct a golf course like what they did in battlefield virginia because it can directly contaminate the groundwater it can pollute and cause injury and cancers in the neighbors of that golf course we also dont want it to be disposed of in pits that arent sealed to handle this special waste like what happened in tennessee when a tva disposal pit collapsed engulfing an entire small town in toxic sludge we should have regulations to protect against that ever happening in our country again this is exactly what this bill the republican bill will do it will blast us back into the past and allow coal ash to be disposed of without proper construction or monitoring at the end of this month transit and highway funding will expire hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake and our transportation infrastructure

that just got bailed out by the american people i stopped my car and i looked at that building and then i looked at the devastation of the communities around that particular part of michigan and i thought whats wrong with this picture basically this institution has sucked up the wealth of neighborhood after neighborhood and left rubble in its way theyre not being held accountable yet i see companies like polyone trying to make it in a global economy with a very unfair set of trade practicesclosed markets around the world currency manipulation intellectual property theft i look at whats happening with competitors with competition to unitedstates industry and you have to say to those patriots who are making goods in america we stand with you we should be rewarding those companies we should be making more goods in our country i wanted to just add a word about the automotive industry there were those in this chamber that voted against the refinancing of the automotive industry

usda was recommending reducing the consumption of potatoes corn peas and lima beans to just one serving a weekwhich believe me i was shocked but it wasnt just myself that had this reaction it was also

nutritional profile of meals served to school children is very important when the usda proposed a rule that eliminated potatoes from the school breakfast program and limited the school lunch program to one cup a week of potatoes i was very concerned on the agriculture committee i have made it frequently known how important healthy living and nutritious eating habits are to me as a person a mother a grandmother and as a legislator it is especially near and dear to my heart when we discuss policies that affect childrens nutritional needs when i heard that the usda recommended reducing the

equation you all know that they are full of potassium vitamins c and b6 potassium fiber and antioxidants i cannot understand why the usda would want to reduce school childrens consumption of potatoes i think that it is short sighted for the usda to ignore the health benefits that the potato provides when looking at how to incentivize healthier eating habits we in congress need to find a way to encourage and educate program recipients to eat balanced meals i think it is very important to make sure that children receive balanced meals and that certainly includes potatoes i along with fortyone of my colleagues sent a letter to the usda asking a number of questions about this proposed rule without objections i would like to submit a copy of this letter to the record mr chair potatoes lima beans peas and corn are all healthy vegetables that should certainly be in the school breakfast and lunch programs potatoes are an excellent source of potassium and good source of fiber according to

five years per meal the cost will increase by 14 cents per lunch and fifty cents per breakfast mr chair school districts and states across the country are already cashstrapped and cannot afford this increased cost this additional burden will be passed onto students paying full price for their meals while i agree with the intent of the usda to encourage the consumption of more fruits and

funding for vawa grant programs for 5 years at the same levels as the senatepassed bill there are only a few minor differences between this house bill and the senate bill h r 4970 doesnt include language to provide special protected status to certain categories of people because they are already covered under vawa h r 4970 doesnt include language to allow indian tribes to prosecute nonindians because that is unconstitutional h r 4970 does include provisions that prevent fraud and abuse in the immigration process this bill authorizes hundreds of millions of dollars for valuable services to victims of domestic violence dating violence sexual assault and stalking those who have supported vawa in the past should be eager to support this legislation today violence against women doesnt occur along party lines and neither should reauthorization of these programs instead of working with republicans in a bipartisan effort to protect women from domestic violence rape and stalking some democrats have chosen to place partisan posturing above the urgent needs of victims of violence if members choose to oppose this bill for political reasons thats their decision but there is no good

back again once more to the subject of mercury but really were going to a more basic subject than mercury and that is the subject of freedom because this energy independence and security act of 2007 is a de facto ban on the plain old lightbulb that americans have known a long time its the incandescent bulb and this de facto ban essentially says that all the new lightbulbs have to be these mercury vapor fluorescent lightbulbs and so the question that comes to my mind is aside from the benefits of one type of lightbulb over anotherand you could argue the benefits the mercury vapor lightbulb is a little more expensive but it saves energy but the incandescent lightbulb burns more energy but it doesnt have any mercury youre bringing into your living room but the point though is dont we trust our constituents to pick the kind of lightbulb that they want im just wondering if theres anybody in this chamber who wants to stand up and vote and say im going to tell my constituents what kind of lightbulb they ought to buy i mean lightbulbs are used in a lot of different contexts a lot of different situations and if people want one of those mercury vapor bulbs thats got good efficiency fine let them buy one but dont tell them they cant buy another kind of bulb that may meet their circumstances and i think thats the kind of arrogance that the public is really fed up with out of congress is when we have this arrogant attitude that were going to tell people even what kind of lightbulb to buy and so what my amendment was going to do was of course to strike this piece of legislation technically we cant do that on this appropriations bill so we have to wait for a different venue in order to do it but i would conclude with the observation that for decade after decade in america the

get rid of the whole bill but why do you bring up legislation today that again i guess youre doing it because you dont want to keep repealing the whole bill over and over again because it becomes ludicrous so instead you take pieces outin this case the state exchangesand you say were not going to give states the grants to actually follow up its obvious when we talked about nathan deal he doesnt like the law hed like to see it repealed but hes saying if youre not going to repeal it then dont defund it because then the states cant carry out their functions in an effective way so all im saying to my colleague from texas is if you just want to keep repealing and repealing like mrs blackburn said go ahead and do it well waste time which doesnt make sense but if youre going to then take pieces out then dont say to the states were going to defund you and not allow you to do what youre already required to do or set this over to the federal government you see this is the absurdity of
