address the great and growing problems of the housing industry of those who depend on it and those millions of americans who cannot now afford to buy or rent a decent home this program speaks not only to the needs of urban dwellers but to those who live in rural areas as well the reagan budget program would actually cause a reduction of 46 000 housing units that are now planned and for which funding is available the reagan program is a wholesale abandonment of efforts to provide affordable housing for the majority who are shut out of the housing market today the bill my colleagues and i are offering today will provide about 250 000 new assisted housing units in fiscal year 1983 under the programs of the department of housing and urban development and it will also provide 57 000 new assisted housing units in the rural areas served by the farmers home administration the cost of our program is modestno more than is available for the current fiscal year for housing assistance which in turn is much less than was available last year modest as it is however our bill is critically needed and is a positive program as against the reagan program of wholesale iandonment and retreat the housing act of 1982 will provide assistance for homebuyers who have modest incomes these are people who could if interest rates were anything like reasonable afford homes without assistance the bill would make available up to 100 000 homes under the section 235 q program and buyers whose incomes are up to 130 percent of area median income could qualify the subsidy would be used to reduce interest payments to a rate of 9 percentsteep by historic terms usurious by my own standards but still affordable by people who have modest incomes the subsidy provided in this program would be limited to 10 yearson the belief that as incomes rise people will be able to eliminate their need for the subsidy moreover there is provision in the bill for a recapture of the subsidy payments additionally our bill will create a new program to replace the existing section 8 multifamily housing program under our bill local government agencies could work with private developers to develop affordable rental housing the subsidy payment would be extremely flexible so that the maximum incentive will exist to create efficient and effective financing plans the subsidy could be in the form of an outright capital grant it coul8a be in the form of a loan a rent subsidy or even a loan for purchase of land it could be any reasonable device that would make the project financially feasible and at the same time modest in cost to the federal government additionally the bill encourages local units of government to do their part by contributions in kind or in cash toward project development this encouragement comes through a preference to project applications that show local participation in the development cost again flexibility is the keythe kind of flexibility that made the urban development action grant the efficient effective program that it has been the bill continues the current level of effort with respect to lowcost public housing development and rehabilitation and provides for adequate operating subsidies as well we recognize that there is an urgent need for lowrent public housing that there is a need to maintain the existing stock and that adequate operating funds are essential to prevent the financial failure of numerous housing agencies we provide in this bill for a full range of rural housing programs at least maintaining existing levels of effort the amount of substandard housing in rural america is disproportionate and our program does not turn its back on the need for better housing in small towns and on farms our bill also recognizes the ravages of unemployment with the resulting rise in mortgage foreclosures we do not believe that the involuntary victims of the nations economic distress should have their misery compounded through the loss of hardearned home equity accordingly the bill provides for an emergency homeowners assistance program one that makes loans available to people who are faced with foreclosures because of involuntary and temporary economic distress the bill extends the various insuring and secondary credit market authori ties all of which are vital tools for the financing and production of homes all of which have proved their worth and all of which have earned the support of everyone who is concerned with housing we recognize that the depression of the housing industry will not end until the economy is set straight but we also recognize that doing nothing is worse than nothing doing nothing will only accelerate the growing crisis among those who seek affordable housing only deepen the depression of the housing industry and worst of all constitute a retreat from our historic commitment to decent and affordable housing for this nation the administration is not offering a housing program it is offering an antimarch 4 1989 housing programan attempt to dis mantle and discard programs that an needed that work ahd that make positive contribution not only to thi wellbeing of the american people bu a positive contribution to the economy as well our bill by contrast is a reaf firmation of the historic and necessary national commitment to housing we understand the certali truth tha without a national housing policy there will never be sufficient housing let alone decent and affordable hous ing for the nation we offer a con structive effective program that learns from the lessons of the past the nonpolicy and antipolicy of the administration by shameful contrast seeks to undo all that has been done and unlearn all that has been learned i include herewith a copy of h r 5731 as follows

increased waterway user fees should be quickly rushed to the shelf so it can begin to collect dust instead of credibility this study which concludes that waterway user fees will have no longterm negative impact on waterborne commerce nor hurt any particular region of the country is incomplete inadequate and inexcusable even so i anticipate it will be trotted out by proponents of waterway user fees including the administration to defend policies which will cripple our nations waterway transportation system cut unitedstates exports add to business and consumer costs and strangle certain regions such as the columbia river basin and the great lakes it is critical to discredit this study now because the administration in its 1983 budget is proposing more than 3 billion in new waterway user fees and that may be just the beginning the study says that no matter what level of waterway user fees are imposed the growth of waterborne transportation is irrepressible the study does concede that at least two waterway users will suffer immediate sizable adverse impacts perhaps for up to 5 years those two user groups according to the study are barge operators and grain interests now in the columbia basin those are the major users of the columbia snake river system in fact last december mote than 80 percent of the tonnage moving through the bonneville lockthe first lock upriver from the port of portland on the columbiawas either grain or fertilizer another 10 percent of the tonnage was fuel for farm use to say that for the next 5 years waterway user fees will hamstring barge traffic for grain and farm products means that use of the columbia snake river system will grind to a virtual halt in addition to the dire consequences for barge operators and farmers this situation also will jeopardize planning underway to construct a new lock at bonneville dam to replace the smallest and slowest lock of the sevenlock system on the columbia snake system and to remove a bottleneck that throttles full development of the waterway so what the section 205 study overlooks is this catch22 system it predicts waterway user fees will cause shortterm negative impacts for certain users but fails to take into account that in some regions those impacted users are the keys to future growth which the study believes beyond all hope and reason will occur no matter what this is a sad commentary especially when you realize that 55 percent of the nations grain exports move through the columbia river basin with the advent of severe waterway user fees much of that cargo may be diverted to other modes of transportation but what is more likely to happen is that grain growers will become less competitive in world markets and will wind up just selling less that means less unitedstates exports and more trade deficits it also means more fuel for inflation and less jobs for america a recent article in the wall street journal summed up the condition of unitedstates agricultural exporters by noting that exports have fallen sharply because of world economic slumps and tensions and because of competition from other countries according to the newspaper apparently an era of explosive export growth which brought about large increases in unitedstates farm income and productivity has ended although farm exports are likely to pick up from current levels their average growth through the 1980s wont approach the boom levels of the 1970s experts say going on the newspaper adds fifteen years ago we werent a world market we were a domestic market all of a sudden the farmer has to answer to world demand these are the new realities that must be considered when undertaking policies such as imposing waterway user feesespecially when the only apparent rationale for such fees is to raise money to reduce deficits caused by runaway military cost overruns and excessive tax cuts to huge corporations and oil conglomerates the section 205 study falls woefully short of dealing with these realities in rushing to its glib if useless judg ments on waterway user fees its con clusions are contrived facts not de rived from facts i want to take this opportunity to list just some of the deficiencies i have found in this study the study overlooks the different impacts waterway user fees have on completed systems and on the developing systems such as the columbia snake river system the study fails to consider the impact on total river systems and instead deals only with inland shallowdraft waterways ignoring that there is direct relationship between deep and shallowdraft waterways it also fails to evaluate the cumulative impact of user charges on deepdraft shallow draft and coast guard activities and therefore the true cost of full recovery and thus the full extent of cargo diver sion and negative impact the study has no element that examines whether waterway user fees would increase or decrease unitedstates productivity and jobcreating possibilities the study overlooks impacts on fuel conservation by discouraging even over the shortterm waterborne commerce no consideration is given to the problems of funding the improvement work which must be done on waterways to overcome capacity limitations at critical points the impact of user charges on the national economy is not measured there is no effort to determine whether benefits in federal budget savings would be exceeded by federal revenue losses stemming from industrial and agricultural dislocations no attempt is made to assess alternative methods of applying charges to waterway users and beneficiaries one alternativea national tonnage taxhas been suggested by senator marx hatfield and i that would raise additional revenue but not cause regional dislocations or unfairly treat any port or waterway system the study does not deal adequately with regional impacts of waterway user fees it doesnt deal at all with possibility that in some regions a shortterm waterway user decline will continue to spiral downward making that form of transportation less and less attractive and making shippers ports and consumers captives of railroads the study concludes that waterway user fees will benefit railroads but does not give a dollar value to that benefit or comment on its equity in light of subsidies to railroads the study is silent on the queston of how waterway user policy affects broader questons of national water policy for example it ignores the fundamental issue of hr w to justify turning locks and waterways into virtually private leaseholdings while at the same time maintaining waterways and their use belong to all americans the study in defending the shift to maintain federal waterway facilities to nonfederal sources did not deal with the reasonable question of transferring management responsibilities commensurate with this new financial reality to nonfederal sources the study is weak on examining impact of cargo diversion caused by waterway user fees on increased capital costs of goods the study does not come to grips with the problem of assigning benefits to users direct and indirect the problems of cost allocation are not alluded to in the study although they are critically important to the success of implementing waterway user fees the corps of engineers estimates in its national waterways study the conclusions of which the section 205 study disagrees with incidentally that the federal government provides about 12 to 13 percent of the total funds invested in marine transportation in the united states although most industry officials say a cutoff in those funds would have a chilling effect on private investment the study ignored it the study concluded that marginal barge operators may fail because of shortterm economic dislocations but failed to consider that the damage could be more widespread if high interest rates and depressed economic conditions persist instead the study reviewed the impact of waterway user fees in a static economic environment an environment virtually no economist says exists or is likely to exist for some time clearly this recital of wrongs and oversights in the section 205 study

funds to minimize impact on these funds and at the same time provide maximum assistance based upon the circumstances involved in each case to those institutions primarily thrift institutions experiencing declining net worth problems during this period of extreme financial stress largely due to persistent doubledigit inflation h r 4603 as amended by the committee provides for increased flexibility in the administration of existing deposit insurance funds for the provision of transitional assistance to thrift institutions during this period of financial stress and for broadened merger possibilities designed to minimize the cost impact on the individual insurance funds while at the same time assisting the maximum number of institutions these changes affect the federal deposit

up to the committees favorable action by voice vote on october 6 will be of interest to the house well over 1 year ago the committee leadership began meeting with regulators individually and collectively as it became increasingly apparent that thrift institutions with their lowyield portfolios and sustained high borrowing costs were experiencing rapidly declining net worth problems and that simple prudence dictated that a workable contingency plan be adopted should the economic situation hold constant or even worsen as has been the case the regulators at the request of the committee leadership were encouraged to prepare concensus draft legislation which was done this draft legislation was discussed by members and staff thoroughly at numerous meetings beginning last spring the legislation before you today h r 4603 remains essentially the bill which was drafted by the regulators during this period numerous meetings were held as well with representatives of the administration

"house resolution 182 is an open rule to facilitate consideration of h r 3518 the department of state and related agencies authorization bill for fiscal 1982 and 1983 the resolution waives points of order that would otherwise lie against consideration of the bill for failure to comply with the budget act as well as points of order that would otherwise lie against the bill for failure to comply with clause 5 of rule xxi section 402 a of the budget act prohibits consideration of any bill which authorizes the enactment of new budget authority for a fiscal year unless that bill has been reported on or before may 15 of the preceding year in this case the committee on foreign affairs has reported h r 3518 which authorizes the appropriation of funds in fiscal 1981 but it did not report the bill on or before may 15 1980 clause 5 of rule xxi prohibits appropriations in a legislgtive bill and the waiver provided by this rule is necessary because several paragraphs of h r 3518 may corfstitute appropriations in a legislative bill while these paragraphs are not specified in the resolution i will ask unanimous consent at the appropriate time to place in the record a brief summary of the provisions of the bill for waivers of points of order are provided for in this resolution in addition to granting these waivers the resolution provides that the bill shall be read for amendment under the 5minute rule by titles instead of by sections and one motion to recommit is provided for after passage of the bill it shall be in order under this rule to take from the speakers table the senate companion bill s 1193 and to consider that bill in the house with a motion to insert the provisions of h r 3518 as passed by the house for this procedure three waivers of the budget act are necessary and are provided for in house resolutidh 182 in the interests of time i will include a summary of the provisions of this rule including the specific provisions of the budget act that are being waived in the record in essence this rule provides for orderly consideration of the bill in a situation where the 1981 ifunds have already been appropriated and this authorization bill was not reported by may 15 of last year as far as taking up the senate companion bill this rule is designed to facilitate a conference with the senate on the matter i do think it important to point out to the members that there was no controversy about the necessity for these waivers in our rules committee hearing and the waivers themselves are supported by the committee on the budget in his letter to chairman bolling chairman jones pointed out that section 302 of the bill h r 3518 authorizes the appropriation of funds in fiscal year 1981 for the board of international broadcasting and various other provisions of the bill may indirectly authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1981 such as section 119 according to chairman jones letter the committee on the budget met on july 14 and voted to support the waiver as requested by the committee on foreign affairs becausei 1 the 1981 funds authorized to be appropriated for the board of international broadcasting were included in the supplemental appropriations and rescission act of 1981 approved june 5 1981 and 2 the bill will not be enacted until fiscal year 1982 so the indirect authorizations will not be used to provide budget authority for fiscal year 1981 as to the bill itself h r 3518 authorizes appropriations totaling 3 133 billion for the department of state the international communication agency the board for international broadcasting and the interamerican foundation for fiscal 1982 the amounts appropriated for fiscal 1982 are in line with the request of the reagan administration for fiscal 1983 however the committee bill is approximately 800 million more than the administrations request for this reason the administration opposes h r 3518 in its reported form and would support amendments to reduce the amounts to be authorized for fiscal 1983 i support the rule as reported by the committee on rules so the house can proceed to consider the measure at this point i place in the record a brief summary of the provision of house resolution 182 and a brief summary of the provisions of h r 3518 for which the waivers contained in the rule apply summary of house resolution 182 1 open rule 2

the governments part the general idea is abhorrent to many of the members here who believe in private property in fact a limit on aggregate tax expenditures as provided by this amendment could have a number of unintended effects for example if tax rates are reduced due to the interaction of such a rate reduction with other tax provisions the rate reduction would reduce the size of the tax
