regarding the funding of the interamerican tropical tuna commission is being followed it does so by limiting the unitedstates contribution to no more than 50 percent of the tropical tuna7 commission thereby ending the longstanding taxpayer subsidy of foreign nations who are members and benefit from the work of this commission there are two principal benefits from this amendment it ensures countries pay their fair share for the tropical tuna commission of its expenses which they committed to when they signed on to the commission in 1997 the law requires that it frees up money for other international fishing commissions that are already funded below the presidents request in 1949 the united states signed onto a convention establishing the interamerican tropical tuna commission this commission was designed to coordinate international efforts to maintain a healthy population of tuna and other marine species taken from the eastern tropical pacific ocean currently 11 nations are members of this commission costa rica panama japan france vanuatu nicaragua venezuela el salvador equador mexico and the united states the tropical tuna commission is involved in many activities that affect all member nations and there are costs associated with these activities and the convention specifies how the commission should be funded it says that those countries that harvest more fish pay more specifically the commission states the proportion of joint expenses to be paid by each of the highcontracting parties shall be related to the proportion of total catch of the fisheries covered by the convention and utilized by the highcontracting party this made sense in 1949 and it makes sense today we paid our share then and we still do now in fact we pay a good deal more than our share circumstances have changed and changes must be made in our payments the united states is no longer the largest beneficiary of tuna from the eastern tropical pacific in fact we only catch about 5 percent of the tuna from this area and our average utilization over the last 10 years has been around 40 percent despite this the united states continues to pay the lions share of funding for the tropical tuna commission as much as 90 percent in recent years the taxpayers subsidy of foreign fishing nations must stop and it is time for these other countries to carry their own weight in fact in 1997 the international dolphin conservation program act requires that member countries pay their fair share of the tropical tuna commission and in fact that same agreement has incentives for them to do so and it is written into law that clearly states the countries that fail to pay their fair share cannot export their tuna into the united states all my amendment does is uphold these requirements of the current law it does not change the 1997 dolphin protection act or the international agreements in any way it simply assumes a critical provision of law will be enforced in addition it has no effect on the international dolphin conservation program funding for observers or other activities the funding for those programs come from fees on the tuna vessels not from the country contributions so this in no way impacts the international dolphin conservation program regardless of how we feel about modifying the dolphinsafe label surely we can all agree that our taxpayers should not be underwriting the fishing interest of these other countries this is a fair position that is the position that the senate just over a week ago on a bipartisan vote agreed to 6135 the money saved will still be available to the state department to spend on 12 other international fisheries commissions which we belong to and which are funded at 2 million below the presidents request in this legislation so let us not undercut a dozen other important commissions so that our constituents can continue to subsidize countries that refuse to pay their fair share contrary to unitedstates law contrary to the agreement that they entered into on the international dolphin conservation if they get the benefits of the act they are supposed to pay their fair share these countries have refused to do so this amendment would still have the united states picking up 50 percent of the cost of this commission that will leave the other 10 countries the need to pick up the other 50 percent even though they utilize it far in excess of that amount i think this is simply about equity for the taxpayers it is about upholding the agreements that people have entered into and i think it is an amendment that we should adopt as did the senate by the bipartisan vote of 6135 this amendment does nothing more than ensure that current law regarding the funding of the interamerican tropical tuna commission is being followed it does so by limiting the unitedstates contribution to no more than 50 percent of the ia ttc budget thereby ending the longstanding taxpayer subsidy of foreign nations who are

so fast he could go across the line and turn around backwards and look at his opponents backwards chasing him many of us followed his remarkable career from when he packed out the high school stadiums

always walter he touched the lives of everyone white and black young and old the bible teaches us about giving and caring honesty and integrity i think walter must have listened well to the preachers

marketplace the importance of being a reliable supplier of food and fiber cannot be overstated the unitedstates agricultural economy is more than twice as reliant on exports as the overall economy congress should have input when the president decides to use american agriculture as a foreign policy tool for american farmers and ranchers trade is an essential part of their livelihood currently exports account for 30 percent of unitedstates farm cash receipts and nearly 40 percent of all agricultural production is exported past experience has shown the weakness in using sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy unfortunately it may be politically impossible to entirely eliminate the use of economic sanctions the president needs to be able to waive those impositions when he believes sanctions will have a negative impact on unitedstates interests especially on american agriculture rather than continue policies that withhold sales of unitedstates food and fiber as punishment h r 17 would urge that food and agricultural trade be encompassed in unitedstates diplomacy such a move would contribute to world security help feed the engine of economic growth and build the lines of communication that allow engagement with these countries with whom we have disagreements june 15 1999 co i urge the passage of this important legislation"], [0.0006170868873596191,

time to me i have put a sign i knowthat not everybody can read but this is a contrast between two countries country a and country b it is the exact representation made by the state department as far as human rights in those two countries as of the end of i want to share with the members just a minute what our own government says about these two countries then i am going to tell members what these two countries are the government human rights record worsens significantly there were problems in many areas including extrajudicial killings disappearances torture brutal beatings arbitrary arrests and detention that is country a country b the governments human rights record deteriorated sharply beginning in the final months of the year with a crackdown against organized political dissent abuses included instances of extrajudicial killings torture mistreatment of prisoners forced confessions arbitrary arrests detention lengthy incommunicado detention and denial of due process one other area let us look at discrimination and violence against women remain serious problems discrimination against women and ethnic minorities worsened during the year country b discrimination against women minorities and the disabled violence against women including coercive family planning practices which sometimes include forced abortion forced sterilization prostitution trafficking in women and children and abuse of children they are all problems i want members to know who these two countries are country a we just spent billions of dollars bombing it is called yugoslavia the great enemy yugoslavia that perpetrated such terrible acts on the kosovar albanians we spent billions bombing them the other country country b is china which we have elevated and said we must trade with regardless of what they do to their people we are schizophrenic if we do continueto have normal trade relations with china why would we bomb one that has an identical record and say the other must be our best trading partner it has to do with money is america going to sell its soul"], [0.0012621879577636719, 0.5012621879577637, 1, "it seems to me that todays debate on this bill is a chance for us to begin to talk about a compromise that will achieve a lot of the ends that our friends have on the other side of the aisle and a lot of the ends and goals that people on our side of the aisle have our discomfort with their version of the bill is not about the fact that they are trying to deal with the marriage penalty i think the vast majority of members believe that we reed to do something to fix this problem of the marriage penalty we think there is a way to do this that costs a good deal less than the bill that they are presenting today we say that with all respect and humility we think there is a way to work our way to a common conclusion that will really attack this problem of the marriage penalty and cost about half maybe a little less than half of what their bill costs we think that is important because at the end of this year we are likely to be talking about a number of tax measures some of which we have already voted on others which we will vote on in the next weeks the president sent to us when he did his reestimate of the budget this pie chart this pie chart sets out 500 billion of the surplus in a reserve to frankly be decided by the next congress and congresses after that we think that makes sense but this budget also puts money into medicare solvency and debt reduction money into a medicare prescription drug benefit plan a lot like the one we presented 2 weeks ago and 263 billion for targeted tax cuts if we do as much as they are asking to do today for the marriage penalty alone it means other good tax cut ideas that there is a lot of support for will fall by the wayside so we believe it is important that we try to work together to come to a series of ideas for tax cuts that we all can support that will fit within this budgetary 263 billion now we further think their bill today is not giving the relief on the marriage penalty that we really need and that we hope that we can offer to people finally the president said 2 weeks ago that he understands the requirement and the desire on the part of republicans to do something about the marriage penalty he said he is more than happy to sit down and try to work out a marriage penalty reduction that he would sign this year i think the same holds true of other tax cut ideas that have been presented but in return for that he wants to also be able to sit down to be able to get a medicare prescription drug benefit plan that we all can agree with as part of settling these important issues let me finally say that if you are suffering from the marriage penalty you want relief now this year not next year you do not want just a veto of a bill that results in nothing if you are on medicare prescription drugs and you are having trouble paying for your prescriptions you want relief now this year not next year my mother is 92 years old she is doing great by the grace of god but every time i go home she says what are you all doing on that medicare prescription drug plan i may not be alive next year i want to be able to tell her were going to get something done this year let us work together vote for this motion to recommit let us work together to get this done for the american people"]]}
