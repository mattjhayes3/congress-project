maryland are all grateful to our colleague congresswoman beverly b byron the chairwoman of the maryland commission on physical fitness this year the state of maryland marks the 25th anniversary of the creation of the maryland commission on physical fitness in addition this is the eighth year in which congresswoman byron has served as the chairwoman of the commission i am grateful that my friend bev byron has given me an opportunity to speak today on behalf of my constituents the citizens of prince georges county i want to extend to you our congratulations and our best wishes on the commissions anniversary maryland i am quite pleased to note was the first state to establish a state commission to address the physical fitness and physical wellbeing of its residents the creation of the maryland commission was a direct outgrowth of president john f kennedys interest in fully implementing the goals of the presidents council on physical fitness and sports an organization established by president dwight d eisenhower in 1956 the basic goals of the commission in the early 1960s and its goals today in the late 1980s remain similar to work with the maryland state department of education to promote physical fitness for all schoolchildren in addition the commission has been active in encouraging adult physical fitness programs including programs that are focused directly on teenagers young adults the middle aged senior citizens and the handicapped much has been accomplished but much more remains to be done american athletes continue to receive an impressive number of gold silver and bronze awards at international sporting events but the health and physical fitness of the average american is of continuing concern to us all most americans even after years of public service announcements of physicians warnings of appalling rates of heart disease and other infirmities of disconcerting medical warnings still continue to smoke to eat too much to drink too much and unfortunately to exercise too little to its credit the maryland commission on physical fitness has taken the lead in arguing that good health vitality and fitness are things for which we all should work throughout our lives good health and physical fitness are just as important for preschoolers as for senior citizens for the young as for the old through the efforts of the maryland commission on physical fitness was well as the endeavors of other state commissions physical fitness is no longer viewed as a passing trend or something only for the young physical fitness should not be viewed as a fad or as a passing fancy physical fitness is much more than the purchase of expensive running shoes or the joining of exclusive exercise clubs much as the ancient greeks and romans we should always view a fit physique as just as important as an educated mind juvenal the roman poet in his tenth satire wrote mens sana in copore sano which has been translated as a sound mind and a sound body juvenal was describing a body not wracked by illness and disease and a mind not corrupted by mental decline and sickness today we also realize the important role played by physical fitness in the prevention of physical as well as mental diseases and problems avoiding physical and mental decomposition leads necessarily to a lifelong commitment to physical and mental conditioning we should all pursue a life of physical fitness and wellbeing for its work in this regard we should applaud the work of the maryland commission on physical fitness in closing i would again like to compliment congresswoman byron for her efforts as chairwoman of the maryland commission on physical fitness again i extend my heartiest congratulations to the maryland commission on physical fitness on its 25th

debate and discussion in my view this bill can and should be adopted with dispatch and without deep division not that it is perfectit is not we have not been able to do everything that i think our security demands and our worldwide commitments require but the important thing is that we have tried to write a responsible consensus bill and i think we succeeded as evidence of thisi cant think of another subcommittee or committee in the congress that features the diversity of opinion and views that we have on the defense subcommittee believe me there is always wide ranging discussion when we mark up however after many hours and days of effort we bring before you a bill which enjoys the unanimous support of the subcommittee and which was agreed to without controversy by the full appropriations committee ume 21 1988 this is a consensus product which as the chairman indicated reflects both the position of the house and more importantly an effort to get the most defense out of every defense dollar this is the result of a great deal of work and cooperation by all members of the defense subcommittee on both sides of the aisle and i want to commend all the members also we have been fortunate to have the services of our tremendous committee staff and i want to acknowledge their efforts and support to me and the members on this side i would like to express my gratitude to the chairman of our subcommittee the distinguished gentleman from florida bill chappell for his evenhandness and his leadership throughout our deliberations hes done an excellent job as we all are aware last years budget summit set this years funding level for defense i can assure the membership that this bill complies with the summit agreement we track the budget resolution and we are about as close to our 302 b allocation as one could imagine 1 million under for both budget authority and outlays it has been easier in some ways to write this bill because of the summitfrom the first day of hearings we knew how much money we would have to work with and this helped expedite the process despite this relative certainty however writing this bill has not been an uncomplicated task by any means i am compelled to remind all members that even though we comply with the summit this is the fourth straight year that defense appropriations will decline in real terms in this bill we provide roughly 10 percent less after inflation than we did in 1985 and for this fiscal year alone to comply with the summit the department of defense had to cut its planned budget by nearly 33 billion a 10percent reduction this forced the administration to confront many difficult tradeoffs i think all members will concede that under frank carlucci the department not only considered these tradeoffs but stepped up and made some hard choices as a result the budget we were sent in february had a number of stark recommendations an active duty troop reduction of 27 000 the drawdown of 16 navy frigates over 600 army helicopters and two air force fighter wings from existing force structure and the cancellation of over a dozen weapons programs secretary carlucci has been up front about how he regards these proposalsmaking it clear that these cuts were proposed only because of fiscal constraintsnot because of any change in commitments or security needs but cuts had to be made and they were what the dod did do was forward a budget organized around three principlesin the words of secretary carlucci these are people readiness and efficient acquisition i think it is safe to the congress in general has agreed with these priorities and our subcommittee has worked hard to produce a bill that funds this approach for example if the 1970s taught us anything about defense priorities it is that good people and combat readiness can be lost faster than anything else and take the most effort and money to restore the pentagon appears to have recognized this in its request the only areas that show significant growth over last year are indeed the personnel and readiness accounts our subcommittee supports this emphasis and in fact in both the military personnel and operations and maintenance accounts we have not only fully funded but have recommended increases over the administrations request military personnel accounts receive an increase of 2 25 billion over last year including a 4percent military pay raise and increases in housing allowances in operations and maintenance we recommend an overall increase of 5 4 billion from last year nearly 7 percent growth this includes a civilian pay raise of 2 percent within this area we have protected the repair and maintenance activities carried out in army depots navy ship repair facilities and air force logistics centers we have not neglected quality of life issues either for example we have added 229 million over the budget to improve military medical care and staffing levels people and readinessthese are part of the real success stories of the 1980s in defense and i believe we have done a lot in this bill to ensure we dont squander the aprovements made since the late 1970s this bill a7so follows through on the departments third priority trying to make more efficient and productive choices in procurement of equipment we have made every effort to avoid costly production stretchouts and where it made sense and where we could find the funds we have increased procurement rates and looked to multiyear contracting i can point to examples of this in nearly every procurement account look at the armywe have increased funding and approved multiyear procurement of its two premier weapons systemsthe m1 tank and the apache attack helicopter these sorts of recommendations are throughout the bill in keeping with our emphasis on readiness we have protected and in some cases added funds over the request for some of the less glamorous procurement programs such as ammunition for the army and marine corps airtoair missiles for the navy i could go on and on there are a lot of success stories and good things in the bill and report before you i cant be honest and say i am comfortable or satisfied with everything we have recommended but on balance i believe we have put together a credible measure recognizing that we dont have the money to do everything it hasnt been easy we have had the same frustration and problems as all members and committees have faced in trying to address valid national needs in the face of fiscal constraints and while this bill certainly has more than its share of hard choices they are only the first steps of what promises to be a very difficult and prolonged process over the next few years for those who are upset with some of this years decisionsbe it a weapons cancellation or manpower cuts affecting an installation some where in the countrylet me tell you it is going to get tougher the pentagon realizes it has to take into account the overall deficit problem and it is perhaps belatedly coming to grips with decisions which must be considered in the face of limited resources i dont know which direction this will take usbe it more manpower cuts program terminations shifts in force structurebut i can only hope we all agree that the congress has to work with the defense department to try and fashion a steady and predictable effort stability is the surest way to save money in defense and if we want to make informed sensible decisions to save money then we have to be prepared to eliminate the rollercoaster up and down defense

there are now about 42 000 cases of aids projected to multiply to 270 000 in 4 years with 179 000 deaths but these numbers represent only the final stage of a progressive disease5 to 10 years or more after the initial infection there may be as many as 2 million americans or more who are now infected with the aids virusand yet more than 9 out of 10 dont know they are infected and are capable of spreading this deadly virus to millions more the dimensions of the challenge are not overblown the battle against this epidemic must begin if we unite and if we summon our deepest courage our compassion and our wisdom and unwaivering will then americans can conquer aids fortunately there is hope within only a few years scientists have identified the aids virus they have studied the stages by which the syndrome develops they have identified how the virus is spread they have even begun working toward a cure and a vaccine although the peculiarities of the virus create enormous difficulties the public health threat of aids is far more prevalent than commonly believed experts believe that aids begins with a virus which though it can kill by itself more frequently causes death by facilitating socalled opportunistic diseases which take advantage of the viruss suppression of the bodys normal immune reactions the centers for disease control have restricted the definition of reportable aids cases to the fullblown syndrome thats where the number of 42 000 aids cases comes from but the virus can be spread by any of the estimated 1 5 to 2 million people who have either the socalled aidsrelated complex a condition that falls short of fullblown aidsor no symptoms at all according to dr robert redfield head of walter reeds department of virus diseases its critical that we change our focus from aids to the virus the number of aids cases is the problem as defined a decade ago the virus represents the magnitude of the problem today according to the new england journal of medicine homosexuals account for about 74 percent of aids cases of which a tenth are also intravenous drug abusers about 17 percent are iv drug addicts 4 percent are heterosexuals who contracted the disease from an infected partner and 3 percent by blood transfusion almost entirely before routine testing of blood donors was begun about 3 percent are unknown though cases definitely traced to other than high risk methods have been relatively rare but like the total number of aids cases these proportions reflect the pattern of infection several years ago dr redfield predicts unfortunately in the absence of a scientific solution over the next decade heterosexual transmission will become the major mode of transmission in the united states we have an opportunity to challenge this deadly virus but we must recognize our common enemy for what it is a deadly sexually transmitted disease this leads to an issue which the congress and all those who deal with the aids crisis must address while aids is a public health issue it includes both medical and moral problems which cannot be ignored anyone who claims it is exclusively a medical problem or only a moral question is dangerously fooling himself historian william h mcneil observes that syphilis was the only disease to flourish in the face of a functioning medical corps during world war i he wrote that disease did attain epidemic proportions among british troops and army doctors failed to handle it effectively at first more from moral than for medical reasons yet president franklin roosevelts surgeon general was able to reduce the spread of syphilis even before a cure was found through a nononsense approach of education about necessary behavior changes widespread routine testing and confidential contact tracing in the same way dealing with aids and its repercussions will inevitably lead to questions of prioritiesprotecting the civil liberties and guarding the confidentiality of aids victims on the one hand and safeguarding the health and wellbeing of society as a whole on the other it also raises unavoidable questions about the behavior which can spreador preventthe disease part of the problem is that our society has been sending conflicting signals on the choices we make columnist william raspberry has written we remain absolute when it comes to illicit drugs while in matters of sex we are rapidly adapting what i call normative moralitya tendency to set rules not on what we think proper behavior but on what people actually do but as president reagan pointed out when it comes to preventing aids dont medicine and morality teach the same thing all the research we have confirms that the answer to that question is yes they do the general outlines of public policy in response to aids can be dictated by common sense and the biological and sociological nature of the disease the bad news about aids is that for now it is deadly incurable and has no vaccine the good news is that infection with the aids virus is preventable in setting public policy we must be guided by two principlescaring and responsibility we must give the same compassionate care to aids patients and their families as for those who suffer from any other similar deadly disease and this includes vigorously supporting the search for effective treatments and for a vaccine it includes making sure that aids sufferers receive full medical treatment and counseling and it includes safeguarding the traditional confidentiality of medical records at the same time we must exercise responsibility responsibility might almost be defined as caring for the potential victims of aids when a fatal disease has no cure it is only common sense to place the greatest emphasis on preventing its spread this involves helping people infecdted with the aids virus to find out so they can take the necessary steps to obtain the best medical care to remain as healthy as possible but also to avoid infecting others while privacy must be safeguarded it is not absolute it does not supersede the right to life and in fact both are routinely respected in the existing framework for dealing with diseases we do not have to reinvent the wheel a reasonable comprehensive national strategy against aids based on these two principlescaring and responsibilitymust include the following elements detection prevention education treatment and research research efforts have already been intensified at the centers for disease control the national institutes of health the walter reed army institute of research and other medical research facilities while congress has acted to appropriate money for research and treatment of aids there has been almost no action on preventing the spread of the disease to fill in the gaps in current

section of the bill which deals with those who violate our military secrets as i said as of an hour ago when i checked with them they still had not been able to get a copy of that and yet we see in

copy of the senate document on the trade bill until it was sent to him by a lobbyist via the japanese embassy i think that is really shocking that the members of the japanese embassy can get our documents documents from the congress of the united states faster than our own house members can receive them i asked mr frenzel about that today and he said yes that is the way he had gotten it and he found out that other lobbyists had as well that the japanese embassy had distributed to them i think it is about time that we really began worrying about the members here on capitol hill more than we worry about the japanese embassy that disturbs me no end it also disturbs me that we are getting back the kind of conference report to vote on tomorrow on trade that we are ever since i have been in congress i have been calling for a strong trade bill one that really espoused fair trade not the free trade that has resulted in exporting so many of our manufacturing jobs as they have but the conference report that is coming back is far different than what we voted out here in this house last summer we voted out a good trade bill it was unacceptable i would have even made that a little stronger but the one that is coming back to us now from what i understandand again we do not have copies we have not been able to read itis so watered down that most sections of it are almost meaningless i hope it is not just a christmas tree assortment of things that people are trying to tie to trade and get it out there and say we passed a trade bill with all of this concerning trade i am very very concerned when i see what is happening to this country as we continue to drown ourselves in imports or allow ourselves to be drowned in imports with the dollars used to pay for those commodities coming into this country coming back to buy up americas assets and to place unitedstates real estate out of the reach of most americans that is what is happening just this past weekend we pulled several articles out of the newspaper along that line here is one from the sunday sun it reported an official from the bank of america who had made a study his investment real estate group had made a study and he released points in that study which said that the japanese bought a record 12 7 billion dollars worth of united states property last year alone an increase of 70 percent over 1986 the study was presented at a conference at the university of southern california last week and it was conducted by kenneth leventhal co an accounting and consulting firm that was the highest estimate of japanese holdings in the united states provided in a documented report the figure means the story goes on that the japanese may be the largest foreign holders of united states real estate now you may say well is that all bad but let us see what is happening with the price of real estate while that is happening in another article in parade magazine on sunday there is a journalist friend of the writer who had some land in the kahala area of honolulu she said recently she was offered 3 million for her home which is exactly 2 8 million more than she paid for it in other words she paid 200 000 for it some time ago now she is being offered 3 million she turned that offer down because she said im sure the japanese will up the price they can up their price because again they have our dollars the dollars we are sending over there to buy their goods their exports which are flooding our markets the journalists friend in hawaii said that in honolulu alone in hawaii alone in the last 2 years the japanese investors have spent at least 6 5 billion buying up to quote her virtually anything in hawaii that isnt nailed down they are purchasing hotels restaurants shopping centers housing tracts office buildings and land of every stripe you name it and theyll buy it her friend reports and at top price too why are the japanese on a buying kick compared to their yen our dollar is the cheapest it has been in a long time moreover they like hawaii and its people about 25 percent of whom are of nipponese descent in another article it points out that one of japans wealthiest men has added to his extensive real estate holdings in hawaii by paying a record 38 million to acquire 5 6 acres of the kaiser estate they are running the prices up sky high high high sky high in a third article in the sunday sun which edition was full of articles about japanese buying our land it said they are now buying up new yorks most prestigious high rises and luxury condominiums as the yens doubled buying power allows them to live out their dreams there are 80 japanese buyers who paid 300 000 to 500 000 each for apartments at the central park place project others who are paying 800 000 to 900 000 in a 39story building that is going up once again you know the real estate people may say what are you objecting to it is money coming in true money is coming in but other than their paying property taxes on that the profit that they get from shopping centers from hotels and others is not contributing to the tax base of this country the initial article out of the sunday sun concerning the bank of america study points out that not all real estate transactions are even included they have such financing of development projects which could reach as high if they get all the figures in as t112254 20
