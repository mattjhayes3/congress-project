business that same day because it was after midnight when obamacare passed it was on that time the strategy that i put together then was that we would file a repeal bill seek the maximum number of cosponsors to repeal obamacare and then move forward with the discharge petition to seek to get 218 signatures on that so that thenspeaker pelosi couldnt block the repeal from coming to the floor we followed through on all of that to the point where we peaked out at 178 signatures on the discharge petition that could have circumvented the speaker seeking to block the repeal of obamacare that discharge petition was one of the tools that was useful in winning the majority on november 2 of this past year and there are members here that openly say they wouldnt be here if they didnt have the discharge petition to point to their opponent and say sign the discharge petition if youre serious if youre against obamacare heres the vehicle to repeal it sign it a number of those who did not and would not were voted out of office and we have a new freshman class here that is 96 strong 87 of them are republicans and i know of none of the 87 that did not run on the repeal of obamacare i dont have confirmation but i believe that every one of the freshmen republicans the 87 ran at least in part if not centrally on working to repeal obamacare after winning the majority so we could actually bring legislation to repeal obamacare the next phase was to bring a repeal bill here to the floor of the house i wanted it to be h r 1 it turned out to be h r 2 i dont know what h r 1 is yet but im very very happy that the leadership took that high a priority to hold a vote here in the house to repeal obamacare so early in the first session of the 112th congress we saw a vote here that was bipartisan and it was unanimous among republicans to repeal obamacare that is a very sound a ringing sound rejection of obamacare by the american people as a result of the election of november 2 by the people they sent here 87 new freshmen republican many of them very very solid then after h r 2 passed the house with unanimous republican support and bipartisan support it went over to the senate where they said it could never pass over here and its a symbolic vote well the republican leader mitch mcconnell did force a vote on the repeal of obamacare it would have taken 60 votes to break the filibuster under those rules well every republican in the united states senate voted to repeal obamacare so we are in this situation today where if you look in the house and in the senate with far larger republican numbers than we have had in past years every republican in the house and the senate has voted to repeal obamacare every single one they are serious and they want to get the job done and their constituents insist that we get the job done as well so now that we have taken this position that we are all of us for repealing obamacare and consistent with two thirds of the american people if we voted to repeal it it would be completely inconsistent for us to vote then to turn around and fund obamacare well if the cr has language in it that allows for funding of obamacare then a vote in support of the continuing resolution is a vote that funds the very thing that we voted to repeal which would be inconsistent and i do not believe that we will have inconsistent members here in the house of representatives i think they voted to repeal obamacare i think they are happy to vote to cut off the funding to obamacare and i believe that we will have universal support for that among our conference and i believe the senate if they have an opportunity for the vote would do the same thing down party lines perhaps but they would do the same thing but herein is the difficulty and its this that the funding that might otherwise be in this continuing resolution or may perhaps actually come out tomorrow in it is not very large in comparison to the overall cost the chairman of the budget committee has said that the spending under obamacare is 2 6 trillion 2 6 trillion now there are taxes enacted by it and we know how the cbo scored the information that they were given but 2 6 trillion in spending would be shut off if we repealed obamacare today we have voted to do so in the house the senate wasnt successful the president likely would veto it is his signature bill it is his identity he is the one that called it obamacare at the blair house february 25 and now its in our dictionary my spell check spells it out for me obamacare but in any case the 1 billion or so that might be cut out of obamacare in the cr if we say none of the funds that are written into this bill can be used to implement or enforce obamacare that 1 billion pales by comparison to the funds that are automatically appropriated that are written into the obamacare bill itself and it is an unusual practice to have that happen when you have a large authorization bill like obamacare come through generally it authorizes the appropriations they are authorized to be appropriated under this section x many dollars to go to implement or enforce the various provisions of obamacare thats where the money is and the real money thats up in that thats automatically appropriated obamacare anticipates and authorizes trillions of dollars to be appropriated to fund it and it authorizes the collection of i believe trillions of dollars in fees and taxes to fund it over time but the automatic appropriations that are unusual but written into obamacare that a lot of people didnt know was in there when it was voted on they will automatically appropriate a number that approaches or exceeds 100 billion in automatic appropriations we are crunching these numbers now and i have to qualify these numbers our low number is down around 65 3 billion our upper number is up around 107 billion crs doesnt have a number cbo doesnt have a number apparently nobody has pressed them to produce the numbers of the automatic appropriations in obamacare in all this time so we are taking this apart and putting it back together and thats why the range is its my shop doing the math on this range 65 3 billion on the low side 107 billion on the high side lets just call it around 100 billion for round figures we could come here on the floor next week and debate a cr and we could see an amendment come thats in order that would cut off all funding in the cr that would be used to fund obamacare if we do that we are cutting off about 1 2 billion in spending if we bring an amendment that shuts off all the funding thats automatically appropriated in obamacare and if we are successful we shut off maybe 100 billion that would be used to implement and enforce obamacare one billion versus 100 billion a 1 percent solution versus a 100 percent solution and if we dont use the 100 percent solution then 100 billion as much as or perhaps more will be aggressively used by the obama administration to implement and enforce obamacare and if they do that the cancerous tumor thats growing because of what it does to our liberty and our freedom sends its roots down deeper and it gets bigger and stronger and harder to eradicate that is part of the strategy so i am hopeful that leadership and the chairman of the appropriations committee will get together and sometime tonight as they put the finishing touches on the cr legislation that they say will come out tomorrow that they will write into the bill the language that i have proposed and since we deal with 2 500 page bills here in the house and we are chastised if we dont read and understand every word of them i have an amendment here that i can read every word of and perhaps it could be understood by everyone in america this is the amendment that shuts off the automatic appropriations to obamacare it is this and i quote notwithstanding any other provision of law none of the funds made available in this act or any previous or subsequent act may be used to carry out the provisions of public law 111148 public law 111152 or any amendment made by either such public law thats the amendment that shuts off not just the funding in the cr to obamacare but it shuts off the selfenacting automatic appropriations that were i believe inappropriately written into the obamacare bill and the reconciliation package that came over from the senate as part of their deal that is why i gave you two bill numbers instead of one but they encompass what we commonly refer to as obamacare that is the amendment that needs to be made in order here on the floor that allows the house to work its will that allows the house to work within order under the rules and by the way regular order is holding committee meetings holding hearings holding subcommittee markups and subcommittee appropriations chairman rehberg would be seated at one of those markups i would think and that would be useful a full appropriations committee markup at all of those stops there would be an opportunity to introduce this language in committee and then succeed i believe in dealing with a parliamentary challenge or if its written into the base bill certainly there would be no parliamentary challenge and if this goes out of the appropriations committee up to the rules committee and doesnt have my language in it at that point the rules committee can protect this language from a point of order but if i bring this language to the floor under an appropriations bill i know that i am facing a parliamentary challenge to this language and it will be hard for the house to work its will if we get to the point where we have a parliamentary challenge on a piece of language that mirrors the will of the american people mirrors the wishes of the american people and mirrors the will and wishes of the members of congress the majority of the members of congress and mirrors the will and the wishes and the votes of 100 percent of the republicans in the united states house and the united states senate and is bipartisan at least in the house that is the endeavor that we need to be successful with and i am very determined to have this kind of debate and find a way to have this vote if we are blocked from a vote that is essential to work the will of the house how then can we say how then can we say that the house has worked its will if the house has been denied an opportunity to work its will i know there are arguments on both sides but i would point out that the language that i have read into the record is not a precedent it doesnt stretch the rules or the history or the traditions of this house it doesnt stretch any written rule that i know of and it is this there is ample precedent ample precedent in the form of the appropriations bills that were used to shut off the funding for the vietnam war now i disagreed with the decision back then i remember reading about it in the news in 1973 and 1974 in fact my recollection says also 1975 but i dont

improve the accountability and transparency of the department of veterans affairs ensuring that va is responsible to those it serves our american veterans as the title of this bill implies this legislation would authorize va health care services for veterans and their families for certain illnesses that manifested as a result of exposure to water contamination at camp lejeune north carolina during a 30year span that ended in 1987 i want to specifically acknowledge the efforts of retired marine master sergeant jerry ensminger whose dogged efforts to seek answers from the government and justice for the victims of the water contamination inspired this bill in honor of jerrys daughter janey who died of leukemia at the age of 9 after time spent at camp lejeune when the water was contaminated title i of this bill bears her name finally i thank representative brad miller and senator richard burr the original sponsors of the camp lejeune legislation in the house and the senate for their leadership and although this legislation represents a hardfought victory we must not forget those who are no longer with us to see it become law i think when senator burr said this he said it best unfortunately many who were exposed have died as a result and are not here to receive the care this bill can provide while i wish we could have accomplished this years ago we now have the opportunity to do the right thing for thousands who were harmed during their service to our country and i couldnt agree more in addition to the veterans of camp lejeune section 106 of this bill contains legislation the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health ms buerkle introduced h r 2074 the veterans sexual assault prevention act the section and her bill which passed the house last year would address the serious failure of the department of veterans affairs to prevent and report sexual assault incidents and corresponding flaws in the security of their facilities it creates a fundamentally safer environment for our veterans and va employees by requiring an accountable and comprehensive oversight system i want to express my personal appreciation to ms buerkle for her advocacy on behalf of women and all of our veterans in just 2 short years she has proven herself to be a committed and strong voice for servicemembers and veterans not only in the state of new york but across this country her considerable expertise as a nurse a lawyer and a mother of six was the reason i chose her to be the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health and i can tell you that in the roll that she has played she has never wavered from doing what is right for all of our veterans the bill also includes several worthy legislative proposals to improve health care services brought forth from our members on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers the house and in the senate this bill also addresses several other areas where we will be able to expand and improve health care for veterans it would allow for greater flexibility in va payments to state veterans homes break down barriers to care for veterans with traumatic brain injury clarify the access rights of service dogs on va property and improve care for rural elderly and homeless veterans this bill also addresses several important matters related to veterans housing because many of our returning wounded warriors need assistance modifying their residences to meet their needs this bill would reauthorize and expand several provisions relating to the specially adapted housing grant program these grants provide funding to eligible disabled veterans and servicemembers who adapt homes that they own or homes that they are currently living in to meet their daily needs adaptations can include grab bars in bathrooms widening doorways for wheelchairs or constructing a wheelchair ramp these grants are imperative to affording veterans the level of independent living that they were accustomed to prior to their injury and that they may not be able to otherwise enjoy as many of us are aware far too many of our veterans have found themselves on hard times and are homeless or are at risk for homelessness to combat this problem this bill would authorize funding for additional housing options for homeless veterans to help them gain stability and obtain access to other treatment and services that they may need from va the next area of the bill would be in addressing education we all know that we have provided a very generous benefit to the veterans in the post9 11 gi bill the problem is that we have never really tracked the performance of the bill or if the benefits are effective in training veterans to be leaders of tomorrow therefore this legislation would increase our oversight of post9 11 educational benefits by requiring annual reports to congress on the effectiveness of these benefits and how theyre being utilized i want to thank my friend congressman gus bilirakis for introducing this provision in h r 2274 and for his leadership on improving transparency for the post9 11 gi bill another critical area addressed by this legislation is that of veteran benefits over the last 3 years weve seen the disability claims backlog grow exponentially with more than 900 000 claims now awaiting decisions fifty percent of those have been pending for a period of 125 days or more despite repeated promises from va to break the backlog it continues to grow therefore the provisions of this bill that address benefit matters will assist in processing claims more efficiently first it would allow veterans to automatically waive regional office review of evidence submitted directly to the board of veterans appeals for claims in appellate status second it would allow veterans in need of assistance with claims to have a signatory on their behalf assist them with the claims process third it would modernize vas statutory duty to assist by authorizing electronic communications potentially saving weeks in a claims processing time fourth to alleviate the burdens of redundant paperwork veterans would now be able to file jointly for social security and indemnity compensation finally to promote accountability of individual claims processors va would be required to present a plan in 6 months on how it will take corrective action when their employees need training to do their jobs well i want to thank my friend mr runyan from new jersey the chairman of the subcommittee on disability assistance and memorial affairs for his dedication to our nations veterans and for his focus on advancing legislation such as h r 2349 which will achieve measurable results in alleviating the backlog of claims while many of these provisions that i have discussed thus far have focused on our efforts to honor our commitment to the brave men and women who serve our nation including those transitioning from the recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan we must also continue our commitment to our fallen heroes accordingly this bill also sets out specific criteria that prohibit disruptions and protests of funerals of members of the armed forces at va national cemeteries and at arlington national cemetery including the imposition of criminal and civil liability for violations of these restrictions in addition given the sacred nature of arlington national cemetery a name synonymous with honoring american freedom this legislation would codify a prohibition on the reservation of grave sites at arlington national cemetery with very limited exceptions i worked closely with mr runyan on this prohibition to ensure that many future generations of american heroes will be buried and honored at arlington national cemetery i want to thank him again for his leadership on this issue and for originally introducing h r 1484 similarly i introduced the original measure on h r 1627 which would place restrictions on the type and placement of monuments at arlington national cemetery due to the fact that the cemetery itself is a monument arlington national cemetery is a unique national treasure it is for this reason that this legislation is necessary to ensure that the integrity of the cemetery is preserved both in its utilization of land with the placement of monuments and with its allocation of grave sites finally this comprehensive legislative package also

midnight when obamacare passed it was on that time the strategy that i put together then was that we would file a repeal bill seek the maximum number of cosponsors to repeal obamacare and then move forward with the discharge petition to seek to get 218 signatures on that so that thenspeaker pelosi couldnt block the repeal from coming to the floor we followed through on all of that to the point where we peaked out at 178 signatures on the discharge petition that could have circumvented the speaker seeking to block the repeal of obamacare that discharge petition was one of the tools that was useful in winning the majority on november 2 of this past year and there are members here that openly say they wouldnt be here if they didnt have the discharge petition to point to their opponent and say sign the discharge petition if youre serious if youre against obamacare heres the vehicle to repeal it sign it a number of those who did not and would not were voted out of office and we have a new freshman class here that is 96 strong 87 of them are republicans and i know of none of the 87 that did not run on the repeal of obamacare i dont have confirmation but i believe that every one of the freshmen republicans the 87 ran at least in part if not centrally on working to repeal obamacare after winning the majority so we could actually bring legislation to repeal obamacare the next phase was to bring a repeal bill here to the floor of the house i wanted it to be h r 1 it turned out to be h r 2 i dont know what h r 1 is yet but im very very happy that the leadership took that high a priority to hold a vote here in the house to repeal obamacare so early in the first session of the 112th congress we saw a vote here that was bipartisan and it was unanimous among republicans to repeal obamacare that is a very sound a ringing sound rejection of obamacare by the american people as a result of the election of november 2 by the people they sent here 87 new freshmen republican many of them very very solid then after h r 2 passed the house with unanimous republican support and bipartisan support it went over to the senate where they said it could never pass over here and its a symbolic vote well the republican leader mitch mcconnell did force a vote on the repeal of obamacare it would have taken 60 votes to break the filibuster under those rules well every republican in the united states senate voted to repeal obamacare so we are in this situation today where if you look in the house and in the senate with far larger republican numbers than we have had in past years every republican in the house and the senate has voted to repeal obamacare every single one they are serious and they want to get the job done and their constituents insist that we get the job done as well so now that we have taken this position that we are all of us for repealing obamacare and consistent with two thirds of the american people if we voted to repeal it it would be completely inconsistent for us to vote then to turn around and fund obamacare well if the cr has language in it that allows for funding of obamacare then a vote in support of the continuing resolution is a vote that funds the very thing that we voted to repeal which would be inconsistent and i do not believe that we will have inconsistent members here in the house of representatives i think they voted to repeal obamacare i think they are happy to vote to cut off the funding to obamacare and i believe that we will have universal support for that among our conference and i believe the senate if they have an opportunity for the vote would do the same thing down party lines perhaps but they would do the same thing but herein is the difficulty and its this that the funding that might otherwise be in this continuing resolution or may perhaps actually come out tomorrow in it is not very large in comparison to the overall cost the chairman of the budget committee has said that the spending under obamacare is 2 6 trillion 2 6 trillion now there are taxes enacted by it and we know how the cbo scored the information that they were given but 2 6 trillion in spending would be shut off if we repealed obamacare today we have voted to do so in the house the senate wasnt successful the president likely would veto it is his signature bill it is his identity he is the one that called it obamacare at the blair house february 25 and now its in our dictionary my spell check spells it out for me obamacare but in any case the 1 billion or so that might be cut out of obamacare in the cr if we say none of the funds that are written into this bill can be used to implement or enforce obamacare that 1 billion pales by comparison to the funds that are automatically appropriated that are written into the obamacare bill itself and it is an unusual practice to have that happen when you have a large authorization bill like obamacare come through generally it authorizes the appropriations they are authorized to be appropriated under this section x many dollars to go to implement or enforce the various provisions of obamacare thats where the money is and the real money thats up in that thats automatically appropriated obamacare anticipates and authorizes trillions of dollars to be appropriated to fund it and it authorizes the collection of i believe trillions of dollars in fees and taxes to fund it over time but the automatic appropriations that are unusual but written into obamacare that a lot of people didnt know was in there when it was voted on they will automatically appropriate a number that approaches or exceeds 100 billion in automatic appropriations we are crunching these numbers now and i have to qualify these numbers our low number is down around 65 3 billion our upper number is up around 107 billion crs doesnt have a number cbo doesnt have a number apparently nobody has pressed them to produce the numbers of the automatic appropriations in obamacare in all this time so we are taking this apart and putting it back together and thats why the range is its my shop doing the math on this range 65 3 billion on the low side 107 billion on the high side lets just call it around 100 billion for round figures we could come here on the floor next week and debate a cr and we could see an amendment come thats in order that would cut off all funding in the cr that would be used to fund obamacare if we do that we are cutting off about 1 2 billion in spending if we bring an amendment that shuts off all the funding thats automatically appropriated in obamacare and if we are successful we shut off maybe 100 billion that would be used to implement and enforce obamacare one billion versus 100 billion a 1 percent solution versus a 100 percent solution and if we dont use the 100 percent solution then 100 billion as much as or perhaps more will be aggressively used by the obama administration to implement and enforce obamacare and if they do that the cancerous tumor thats growing because of what it does to our liberty and our freedom sends its roots down deeper and it gets bigger and stronger and harder to eradicate that is part of the strategy so i am hopeful that leadership and the chairman of the appropriations committee will get together and sometime tonight as they put the finishing touches on the cr legislation that they say will come out tomorrow that they will write into the bill the language that i have proposed and since we deal with 2 500 page bills here in the house and we are chastised if we dont read and understand every word of them i have an amendment here that i can read every word of and perhaps it could be understood by everyone in america this is the amendment that shuts off the automatic appropriations to obamacare it is this and i quote notwithstanding any other provision of law none of the funds made available in this act or any previous or subsequent act may be used to carry out the provisions of public law 111148 public law 111152 or any amendment made by either such public law thats the amendment that shuts off not just the funding in the cr to obamacare but it shuts off the selfenacting automatic appropriations that were i believe inappropriately written into the obamacare bill and the reconciliation package that came over from the senate as part of their deal that is why i gave you two bill numbers instead of one but they encompass what we commonly refer to as obamacare that is the amendment that needs to be made in order here on the floor that allows the house to work its will that allows the house to work within order under the rules and by the way regular order is holding committee meetings holding hearings holding subcommittee markups and subcommittee appropriations chairman rehberg would be seated at one of those markups i would think and that would be useful a full appropriations committee markup at all of those stops there would be an opportunity to introduce this language in committee and then succeed i believe in dealing with a parliamentary challenge or if its written into the base bill certainly there would be no parliamentary challenge and if this goes out of the appropriations committee up to the rules committee and doesnt have my language in it at that point the rules committee can protect this language from a point of order but if i bring this language to the floor under an appropriations bill i know that i am facing a parliamentary challenge to this language and it will be hard for the house to work its will if we get to the point where we have a parliamentary challenge on a piece of language that mirrors the will of the american people mirrors the wishes of the american people and mirrors the will and wishes of the members of congress the majority of the members of congress and mirrors the will and the wishes and the votes of 100 percent of the republicans in the united states house and the united states senate and is bipartisan at least in the house that is the endeavor that we need to be successful with and i am very determined to have this kind of debate and find a way to have this vote if we are blocked from a vote that is essential to work the will of the house how then can we say how then can we say that the house has worked its will if the house has been denied an opportunity to work its will i know there are arguments on both sides but i would point out that the language that i have read into the record is not a precedent it doesnt stretch the rules or the history or the traditions of this house it doesnt stretch any written rule that i know of and it is this there is ample precedent ample precedent in the form of the appropriations bills that were used to shut off the funding

and transparency of the department of veterans affairs ensuring that va is responsible to those it serves our american veterans as the title of this bill implies this legislation would authorize va health care services for veterans and their families for certain illnesses that manifested as a result of exposure to water contamination at camp lejeune north carolina during a 30year span that ended in 1987 i want to specifically acknowledge the efforts of retired marine master sergeant jerry ensminger whose dogged efforts to seek answers from the government and justice for the victims of the water contamination inspired this bill in honor of jerrys daughter janey who died of leukemia at the age of 9 after time spent at camp lejeune when the water was contaminated title i of this bill bears her name finally i thank representative brad miller and senator richard burr the original sponsors of the camp lejeune legislation in the house and the senate for their leadership and although this legislation represents a hardfought victory we must not forget those who are no longer with us to see it become law i think when senator burr said this he said it best unfortunately many who were exposed have died as a result and are not here to receive the care this bill can provide while i wish we could have accomplished this years ago we now have the opportunity to do the right thing for thousands who were harmed during their service to our country and i couldnt agree more in addition to the veterans of camp lejeune section 106 of this bill contains legislation the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health ms buerkle introduced h r 2074 the veterans sexual assault prevention act the section and her bill which passed the house last year would address the serious failure of the department of veterans affairs to prevent and report sexual assault incidents and corresponding flaws in the security of their facilities it creates a fundamentally safer environment for our veterans and va employees by requiring an accountable and comprehensive oversight system i want to express my personal appreciation to ms buerkle for her advocacy on behalf of women and all of our veterans in just 2 short years she has proven herself to be a committed and strong voice for servicemembers and veterans not only in the state of new york but across this country her considerable expertise as a nurse a lawyer and a mother of six was the reason i chose her to be the chairwoman of the subcommittee on health and i can tell you that in the roll that she has played she has never wavered from doing what is right for all of our veterans the bill also includes several worthy legislative proposals to improve health care services brought forth from our members on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers the house and in the senate this bill also addresses several other areas where we will be able to expand and improve health care for veterans it would allow for greater flexibility in va payments to state veterans homes break down barriers to care for veterans with traumatic brain injury clarify the access rights of service dogs on va property and improve care for rural elderly and homeless veterans this bill also addresses several important matters related to veterans housing because many of our returning wounded warriors need assistance modifying their residences to meet their needs this bill would reauthorize and expand several provisions relating to the specially adapted housing grant program these grants provide funding to eligible disabled veterans and servicemembers who adapt homes that they own or homes that they are currently living in to meet their daily needs adaptations can include grab bars in bathrooms widening doorways for wheelchairs or constructing a wheelchair ramp these grants are imperative to affording veterans the level of independent living that they were accustomed to prior to their injury and that they may not be able to otherwise enjoy as many of us are aware far too many of our veterans have found themselves on hard times and are homeless or are at risk for homelessness to combat this problem this bill would authorize funding for additional housing options for homeless veterans to help them gain stability and obtain access to other treatment and services that they may need from va the next area of the bill would be in addressing education we all know that we have provided a very generous benefit to the veterans in the post9 11 gi bill the problem is that we have never really tracked the performance of the bill or if the benefits are effective in training veterans to be leaders of tomorrow therefore this legislation would increase our oversight of post9 11 educational benefits by requiring annual reports to congress on the effectiveness of these benefits and how theyre being utilized i want to thank my friend congressman gus bilirakis for introducing this provision in h r 2274 and for his leadership on improving transparency for the post9 11 gi bill another critical area addressed by this legislation is that of veteran benefits over the last 3 years weve seen the disability claims backlog grow exponentially with more than 900 000 claims now awaiting decisions fifty percent of those have been pending for a period of 125 days or more despite repeated promises from va to break the backlog it continues to grow therefore the provisions of this bill that address benefit matters will assist in processing claims more efficiently first it would allow veterans to automatically waive regional office review of evidence submitted directly to the board of veterans appeals for claims in appellate status second it would allow veterans in need of assistance with claims to have a signatory on their behalf assist them with the claims process third it would modernize vas statutory duty to assist by authorizing electronic communications potentially saving weeks in a claims processing time fourth to alleviate the burdens of redundant paperwork veterans would now be able to file jointly for social security and indemnity compensation finally to promote accountability of individual claims processors va would be required to present a plan in 6 months on how it will take corrective action when their employees need training to do their jobs well i want to thank my friend mr runyan from new jersey the chairman of the subcommittee on disability assistance and memorial affairs for his dedication to our nations veterans and for his focus on advancing legislation such as h r 2349 which will achieve measurable results in alleviating the backlog of claims while many of these provisions that i have discussed thus far have focused on our efforts to honor our commitment to the brave men and women who serve our nation including those transitioning from the recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan we must also continue our commitment to our fallen heroes accordingly this bill also sets out specific criteria that prohibit disruptions and protests of funerals of members of the armed forces at va national cemeteries and at arlington national cemetery including the imposition of criminal and civil liability for violations of these restrictions in addition given the sacred nature of arlington national cemetery a name synonymous with honoring american freedom this legislation

identifying and reforming regulations that were unduly burdensome on the manufacturing sector that produced little or no public benefit the bill before us today will institutionalize this process by requiring a national manufacturing report so that we can keep the focus of our government on how to best help the strongest economic engine of our economy my office spent years developing a chart to identify the numerous federal programs and agencies that support manufacturing it is still difficult to have a central focal point to know who is manufacturing and who is doing research in a particular area for example if somebody wants to do research on machining titanium there is no central portal through which that person can go to determine exactly what programs there are and who is doing the research fundamentally its very important to have this report why because americans need to know the importance of manufacturing if we dont have manufacturing agriculture and mining in this country we become a third world nation if we cant make things with our hands then we become hindered in maintaining our status as a world leader i would call upon the house to vote affirmatively for this great bill the american manufacturing competitiveness act of 2012 h r 5865"]]}
