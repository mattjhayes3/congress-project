000 people showed up at the bradley central high school football arena to honor a great american hero i spoke with sergeant weirs mother and father 2 days ago lynn and jackie weir and it is just extraordinary to me that there are families in this country that love freedom so much love our country so much that even in the most grief and sadness they could ever imagine or experience a hundred percent believe in the mission the service the sacrifice of their own son to defend liberty for our nation lynn weir told me that if he would have tried and he didnt to keep his son from going he could not have kept his son from going he said david weir from the time he was a little boy wanted to serve his country in uniform he was a member of the 101st airborne this was his career this was his way of life he leaves a wife behind alison a little 18monthold son gavin who does not understand what has happened but everyone else knows very clearly what has happened a great american patriot died doing what he wanted to do which was to stand in harms way on behalf of our civilian population as the greatest generation did as other generations have been called to at a time when there is a very real and imminent threat to our way of life called the islamic jihadists and sergeant weir goes to heaven leaves this earth as others have in the most sacrificial way answering the scriptural

are transferring responsibility for the security ih many provinces and another one was transferred yesterday and cities back to the iraqi military while certain people want to say it is a civil war i want to tell you firsthand it is more about islamic jihadists crossing over the borders they continue to attempt to disrupt a young emerging democracy the insurgents are capitalizing on the inexperience of this government and directly causing the sectarian violence and socalled fueling the fire they get more and more strength and resolve when they hear the discourse in our country they know it is only a matter of time before we give up because we perceive the war in iraq is too difficult we all know anything worthwhile is not easy freedom is not free the iraqis are trying to make itwork if we retreat the terrorists win they win now and they win in the future when they have a safe haven to plan train and operate and attack us again it is our choice we are either going to support our efforts to win the global war on terror or we are going to support those that want to retreat inside our borders and wait for the next attack we found out on 9 11 if we retreat they attack

own hemisphere to the south the president of venezuela comes to our country and says this hugo chavez is his name in this country we call each other out of respect even the people who just spoke whom i couldnt disagree with more the people who just spoke are all talking politics they are all interested in the next election not frankly the future of our country and preserving liberty and standing up and meeting the challenge of this generation it is all for them about 47 days from now in an election instead of i believe in my gut standing up and protecting our country but despite that because we are decent reasonable we call them honorable we call each other honorable regardless of whether we agree or not i have got to tell you what the president of venezuela did in this country yesterday was dishonorable it dishonored his nation it dishonors the people of his nation it dishonors everyone south of here in our hemisphere because what it does is it causes people in this country not to trust or even like people who come into this country and say what president hugo chavez said yesterday he said this the devil was here yesterday it still smells of sulfur around here he added he said the president of the united states the gentleman to whom i refer as the devil came here talking as if he owned the world truly as the owner of the world i think we could call a psychiatrist to analyze

criticism of president bush it should be restricted to americans whether they voted for him or not i just want to make it abundantly clear to hugo chavez or any other president do not come to the united states and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that americans do not feel offended when you offend our commander in chief thank you charlie rangel for being an honorable democrat who stands united at this time of war hugo chavez is a troublemaker in a big way he wants to work with iranian president ahmadinejad i watched his interview last night on anderson cooper and he calmly looked anderson cooper in the eyes and he gave a very warped view of history not even willing to acknowledge that the holocaust took place completely in denial you would have to wonder where in the world he gets his facts or his view of the world this is a troubling time in american history i say to young people everywhere i go the days ahead will be very very difficult we need to be honest with them about this but the character of this great nation was born out of the sacrifices the courage and the willingness to face these challenges of our grandparents and our greatgrand7 parents the greatest generation they are the standard for stepping up to meeting global challenges and they gave us our character we didnt get our character by the big buildings or wall street or wealth or even military power we got it by sacrifice and dedication and commitment and family and they are the standard they didnt cower or retreat from these challenges they stood up they faced them head on they showed us what it took to preserve freedom and extend it from one generation to the next and we must do the same thing we must come together as a nation i hate it that we are in the middle of this political campaign while we are at war because it is not good for us to say the things we say even on the floor of this house it is not good for lieutenant colonel hale and others to look back here and see the potshots being fired i hate it that over half of the democrats in the senate voted to remove saddam hussein by force and almost half of the democrats voted and now they all say it was a mistake let me tell you there has never been a pretty war never there has never been one perfectly executed and you do not remove a

american people will continue to face high dprinted on recycled paper prices of gasoline and soon will face even higher costs for natural gas short of moving to florida or another warm weather state the american people are looking to congress to solve this problem recent events such as hurricanes katrina and rita have highlighted a very serious problem with the nations crude oil and gasoline supply demand balance one way to fix this balance is for the united states to increase its refining and production capacity no new refinery has been built in the united states in nearly 30 years total current capacity at operating refineries is 17 million barrels per day while total unitedstates demand is nearly 21 million barrels per day therefore the only way to bridge this gap is to increase the amount of imported refined products from foreign sources currently the unitedstates imports 7 9 percent of its total refined petroleum products by 2005 the unitedstates is expected to import 10 7 percent of its total these staggering numbers further underscore the dire need fornew and increased refining capacity in the united states if not we will continue to rely on unstable antiamerican governments to meet our growing demand for gasoline not only will this situation be a blow to economic growth in this country but it will also represent a serious national security risk for all of us even before hurricanes katrina and rita a number of market factors contributed to the record high gas prices an increased demand at honie and abroad political unrest in the middle east and in africa and product disruptions contributed to the already tightening supply of crude oil until refining capacity and production capacity grow faster than demand oil markets will remain tight and vulnerable to unforeseen and unpreventable events such as natural disasters the high cost of gasoline and other fuels has the potential to stifle economic and job growth and is putting a strain on the wallets of american families of course the most efficient way to reduce our dependence on oil and gas is to encourage conservation making sure your tires are inflated properly carpooling and using public transportation are all fast and easy ways to conserve gasoline in homes buying energyeffici6nt appliances and making sure doors and windows are properly sealed are effective ways to conserve but these are st4ortterm fixes curbing demand is necessary but in the long term it is not merely enough we need to increase domestic production of oil currently the unitedstates imports about 60 percent of all of its oil the department of energy projects this number to increase to 73 percent by the year 2025 in order to ensure reliable and secure supplies of oil we have no choice but to increase the domestic supply one way to increase production is to finally open anwr to oil and gas exploration in alaska the united states geological survey estimates that there is between 5 7 and 16 billion barrels of oil that is technically recoverable this estimate does not take into account that with new technology the share could become even higher a resource of this magnitude cannot simply be ignored anwr alone would be capable of reversing the decline in unitedstates petroleum supply within a decade it is not a quick fix there are no quick fixes but it is the quickest and most reliable option we now have to reverse the decline brought upon us by years of neglect of our domestic capacity in addition to gasoline oil and natural gas play a key role in the homes of all of us oil and natural gas help generate the electricity that powers lights appliances and entertainment systems they also provide the building block for plastics resealable food storage containers and durable appliances and electronics all of which contribute to a convenient and safe environment for all of us in closing even under the best circumstances storms like hurricanes katrina and rita would have had a noticeable impact on oil markets however at a time of extremely high demand and tight supplies practically shutting down the united states largest oil and refining region caused even greater pressure on our oil markets in order to alleviate this pressure we must increase our domestic refining capacity and production if not gasoline and home heating prices will continue to climb"]],

good things going on in iraq of course we know that some have been concerned a civil war may be breaking out over there but the truth is what this boils down to is they have been finding with the ieds these explosive devices that have been killing now both iraqis and americans that that hasnt worked they have seen we have a president with firm resolve that we are going to stay the course and make sure the country is ready to stand on its own and then let her stand so they realized they were not being successful in that regard so a lastditch effort you have terrorists from other areas coming in and blowing up their own precious mosques to try to turn shia against sunni it is obvious that this is a lastditch effort to try to divide the country because it scares a lot of folks over there greatly to think about a democracy succeeding right in the heart of the middle east i mean that could spread to iran boy that scares iran it could spread to syria there are a number of countries over there that it scares them because democracy as the president has said could change things and those folks are right on each others borders if i could take you back to 1973 between my sophomore and junior year in college i was an exchange student in the former soviet union back then we didnt call it the former soviet union it was the soviet union and i spent asummer there and associated with and dealt with college students there in ukraine where i was and i developed a number of friends one of whom was an engineering student a smart guy he spoke a little better english than i did russian well a lot better english than i did russian we had some wonderful conversations very frank veryhonest discussions and at one point he was saying you americans seem to not understand why we would cling to communism but it is the best thing we have ever had we have had two major wars on our own soil and we have had to divert most everything to defense just to protect ourselves as he pointed out you on the other hand you have got two major oceans protecting the east and the west think about that that is profound and that is something that will be written about the united states hundreds of years from now when someone writes about the rise and fall of the greatest nation in the history of the world that we had two major oceans now i would say that is a blessing from god that is what has allowed this nation to be nourished and to grow without much threat of intervention from other countries because they had to cross two major oceans to get here the thing that concerns me is finding out we are potentially allowing footholds on our own soil we are giving up an advantage i didnt realize we had other foreign countries managing leasing utilizing avenues of entry in our ports but now we have one transaction that is up right now with the uae the united arab emirates as some have pointed out the uae has been our friend since 9 11 and that is interesting in and of itself but there is a transaction in question that has stirred up much of america for them to purchase or lease terminals at six of our ports so i think it bears looking into if this goes through of course they would be handling shipping arrivals departures unloading at the dock and other security sensitive functions yes we would still have our coast guard yes we would still have american customs at work some of us are aware that they do not always catch everything we are a little sarcastic sometimes in texas but they may have containers sitting on their docks for a number of days they will necessarily be aware of the manner in which our government inspects containers how it selects the maybe 5 to 6 percent that it actually xrays how it goes about selecting which container will be one of themaybe 1 percent that they actually examine the current administration has looked at the issue and seems surprised that americans are really upset about the issue and i want to say about this president he is the first president in at least 30 years to take seriously the threat of a foreign government i know i was in the united states army at fort benning georgia back when the united states soil was attacked and americans were taken hostage that is an act of war under international law you attack somebodys embassy as ours was attacked in iran it is an act of war and it justifies defending yourself and we did nothing we begged them to let them go and then later because of a lack of leadership here in washington there was a failed rescue attempt that embarrassed us even further but it sent a message that perhaps we do not have the stomach we cannot handle these things perhaps if we had had an administration in washington 30 years ago that took care of business when we were attacked we would not be worrying about these issues now but it did not and so we do some say well since the uae is one of three nations to have recognized the taliban as an official government that that gives them concern as it should there are indications that the uae also saw an opportunity for making money and so apparently there were al qaeda moneys that flowed through uae systems but this administration has done more to fight terrorism abroad than any perhaps in history this terrorism is a relatively new phenomenon for our young country but we have not done so well at home and so it bears looking at even more closely we need legal immigration we need people legally coming across the border willing to work most all of us were a result of immigrants even being here it is a good thing if you are willing to work but we need to secure our borders so terrorists do not come in now since there is a war going on near our unitedstates border at our unitedstates border and some of us believe there have been insufficient efforts by the federal government to intervene and help our sheriffs and those that are trying to fight that war it gets even more critical i personally do not believe that this great nation should be contracting out any rights to manage operate use"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "well i am not too sure about that i think it is going to be kind of tough to go home and explain how you are voting against an additional 100 million for title i and i think you are going to have a tough time explaining to parefits of children that have special needs that you voted against an additional 100 million for the programs for special needs kids i think you are going to have a tough time explaining how you voted against adding 250 million in medical research at nih to deal with the multitude of challenges and to the communities that are earmarked for community health centers to help people without a doctor without medical care i am not sure how you explain to them they are going to have a merry christmas when they are not getting their community health centers and the community services block grants i want to say to my colleagues this is a good bill i recognize we had limited tesources there are a lot of things that were unusual this year with katrina and with other challenges and what we have tried to do is do the best we can with what was available and i think we have done some pretty positive things i want to say to my colleagues on our side of the aisle we are not getting any help from pur friends on the minority side so i would hope that we will have strong strong support on our side to demonstrate that we can govern that we can pass a very responsible bill with less money than the past because we have managed what we had in a more effective way but also i say to my colleagues that we want to say to the public that we do care about education that we do care about the teachers that we do care about the students who will benefit from that extra 100 million in title i we want to say to the families of special needs children we do care about your problem and we want to support that extra 100 million that is in this bill and we want to say to people who are confronted with the whole myriad of challenging medical problems such as juvenile diabetes that we want to help and we want to support an additional 250 million for nih we want to say to those 6hat need community health centers where they do not have access to medical care we want to help you with 66 million additional and with liheap with the northeast in particular and with the community services block grants this is a bill that is caring about people i woult suggest to my colleagues on this side that we need to demonstrate with a very strong vote that even though our friends on the other side think it is not enough that it is going to have problems involving reconciliation but this is not a ways and means bill this is not a budget bill this is the peoples bill with peoples programs it is not the reconciliation bill that is another topic and people will have their opportunity to vote on that but i simply want to say that given the resources that we have given the times that we are confronted with that we have done a very responsible job even to the point that members have sacrificed their earmarks they have sacrificed 1 billion worth of earmarks in order to do the things that i outlined before to do more education to do more health research to do more community health centers so this is something that all of us are taking part in trying to serve the needs of the american people as effectively as possible this is a lot of money 142 5 billion and this literally is the peoples bill i want to point out to my friends on the other side that when the republicans became the majority party this bill was 69 billion today it is 142 billion more than double what it was in 1994 that is pretty substantial dedication to education to health research to a whole host of things i would point out in the last 10 years we have increased title i aid to disadvantaged students by 91 percent we have increased special education by 380 percent that is a dramatic increase i think it is great that we and i want to say historically that has had strong bipartisan support that we care about people who have needs i was once an elementary principal in a public school and we did not have any special education program that was the problem of the families today we have billions of dollars spent on these programs that is a credit to america that people do care about each other and it is demonstrated by the support we have for idea with an increase of 380 percent that has been bipartisan we have tripled the federal funding for reading programs i think we are more and more aware that learning to read early in your education experience is vitally important today we are faced within the united states with a dropout rate of over 30 percent that is a terrible waste of human talent one of the things that causes that i think isinadequate reading programs early on we are trying to address that problem we have addressed that problem we are also recognizing in thisbill that the key to a good public education system is a good teacher a good principal a good superintendent caring people so we put in this bill some additional money to recruit and retrain quality public school teachers and principals parents who have worked with principals in the school system know how important that is pell grants we have gone up 64 percent in the last 10 years again we want to help those students who want to get an education who have limited economic resources to get an opportunity to participate in the american dream we have done this with americas historically black colleges we have increased their funding 182 percent that is a dramatic commitment on the part of the federal government all in all i think we as congress can take some pride this is not the back of the bus when you spend 142 billion anything but this is a frontrow seat and we have tried to make sure that every american every american could be in that frontrow seat on the education bus on the health research bus on the labor department programs for job retraining bus i think this is a bill we can take pride in my colleagues on my side since we cannot get any help from our friends on the minority side for whatever reason i have not quite figured that out but i think our members need to strongly support this bill and continue the pride we can take in our accomplishments since we became a majority since 1994 as i have outlined and particularly in the last 10 years this is a bill that is responsible it is a bill that reflects good management of resources it is a bill that we should all support strongly i hope my colleagues on the majority side will come in and vote in a positive way to increase education to increase medical research to increase a whole host of things that will serve our people throughout this land effectively"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "well for some additional comments on that before we move to our policy debate i think you make excellent points i want to congratulate you

to our committees and when we go home or when we are in different arenas with our follow members republican or detnocrat we can get a lot done when we are not on screen or when we are not a talking head on a 60second campaign or television ad i think that the american public has sort of lost faith that maybe we can accomplish things we know that things get done i think that what we are running the risk of and you mentioned collateral damage what we run the risk of is losing the ear of the american public not only are they not bringing their children to the television to listen to what we are talking about they are turning us off because they cannot find the truth in what we are saying because we overexaggerate or we try to disparage peoples character or lose respect in our arguments i think if we lose the attention of the american public we run the risk of an apathetic country that no longer cares or has faith in their leadership to be able to cut through and cut to the chase and

generations have been called to at a time when there is a very real and imminent threat to our way of life called the islamic jihadists and sergeant weir goes to heaven leaves this earth as others have in the most sacrificial way answering the scriptural call that says no greater love hath any man than to lay down his life for his friends and i say to jackie and to lynn and to alison and to gavin your father your husband chris his brother your son gave his life for everyone in our country we will never forget him we will always remember him we hail his life a sacrificial life of service to others putting everyone else above himself believing in his mission and his comrades his father said he talked to him the day before and he was so excited about getting out in the streets of baghdad because he didnt want to be sitting behind a desk because that was not what he was trained to do that was not what he volunteered to do that was not what he was prepared to do he did what he went there to do and it cost him his life and while his parents grieve our state and our nation stand united i believe in their full appreciation of his life and his sacrifice and his extraordinary courage and bravery on monday this coming monday i am honored to be with the family in chattanooga tennessee with full military honors as we lay him to rest in the national cemetery thank you sergeant weir for loving our country so much that you were willing to die for it another friend from my district lieutenant colonel brett hale is there serving in iraq today he is the commander of the dragon slayers he too is a patriot his family is back home praying for him every day a wife and children he sent me an email 10 days ago i want to read part of it in my tribute and our honor on the house floor tonight of these great american patriots who volunteered to serve our country and make their life secondary to ours he wrote me and said if we could only get the truth communicated to the public they would know we have made great strides here in iraq weekly we are transferring responsibility for the security ih many provinces and another one was transferred yesterday and cities back to the iraqi military while certain people want to say it is a civil war i want to tell you firsthand it is more about islamic jihadists crossing over the borders they continue to attempt to disrupt a young emerging democracy the insurgents are capitalizing on the inexperience of this government and directly causing the sectarian violence and socalled fueling the fire they get more and more strength and resolve when they hear the discourse in our country they know it is only a matter of time before we give up because we perceive the war in iraq is too difficult we all know anything worthwhile is not easy freedom is not free the iraqis are trying to make itwork if we retreat the terrorists win they win now and they win in the future when they have a safe haven to plan train and operate and attack us again it is our choice we are either going to support our efforts to win the global war on terror or we are going to support those that want to retreat inside our borders and wait for the next attack we found out on 9 11 if we retreat they attack finally why did we go to iraq ask yourself why did we fight germany in world war 11 japan attacked us not germany the same principle applies we couldnt take the chance then and we cant now those that say otherwise are sympathizing with the enemy that is from lieutenant colonel brett hale to me on the ground in iraq what a patriot as he says the word is not getting out in this country in a fair way of the progress that we are mak ing as general casey said if we leave they will follow us home these threats are real i have been down here 4 weeks in a row as i have been in washington to try to go through the severity of these real threats around the world and the fact that the jihadists are spreading like wildfire through europe read the book while europe slept read the book londonstan you will know that through the mosques there is a radicalization under way even the pope cant speak of it because it is not politically correct to say that fanaticism in religion is not good for the world it ought to be obvious regardless of what the religion is or how many there are or what is politically correct fanaticism does lead to holy wars and the crusades and we dont want that we want the mullahs and the ayatollahs to condemn suicide bombings we want peace and security for the world we want our allies to have a backbone and stand up and acknowledge the threat we want our president to go to the united nations and say we cant appease other countries we have to stand behind security for all and freedom for people and liberty everywhere we are all amazed in this country that from our own hemisphere to the south the president of venezuela comes to our country and says this hugo chavez is his name in this country we call each other out of respect even the people who just spoke whom i couldnt disagree with more the people who just spoke are all talking politics they are all interested in the next election not frankly the future of our country and preserving liberty and standing up and meeting the challenge of this generation it is all for them about 47 days from now in an election instead of i believe in my gut standing up and protecting our country but despite that because we are decent reasonable we call them honorable we call each other honorable regardless of whether we agree or not i have got to tell you what the president of venezuela did in this country yesterday was dishonorable it dishonored his nation it dishonors the people of his nation it dishonors everyone south of here in our hemisphere because what it does is it causes people in this country not to trust or even like people who come into this country and say what president hugo chavez said yesterday he said this the devil was here yesterday it still smells of sulfur around here he added he said the president of the united states the gentleman to whom i refer as the devil came here talking as if he owned the world truly as the owner of the world i think we could call a psychiatrist to analyze yesterdays statement made by the president of the united states as the spokesman of imperialism he came to share his nostrums to try to preserve the current pattern of domination exploitation and pillage of the peoples of the world he said the president of the united states came to talk to the peoplesto the peoples of world what would those peoples of the world tell him if they were given the floor i think i have some inkling of what the peoples of the south the oppressed peoples think they would say yankee imperialist go home i have the feeling dear world dictator that you are going to live the rest of your days as a nightmare because the rest of us are standing up all those who are rising up against american imperialism who are shouting for equality for respect for the sovereignty of nations this was the president of venezuela in our country saying this and let us praise a democrat in this house named charlie rangel whom i seldom agree with but boy do i appreciate his patriotism in defense of our country and its traditions when he said this today he said you do not come into my country my congressional district and you do not condemn my president if there is any criticism of president bush it should be restricted to americans whether they voted for him or not i just want to make it abundantly clear to hugo chavez or any other president do not come to the united states and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that americans do not feel offended when you offend our commander in chief thank you charlie rangel for being an honorable democrat who stands united at this time of war hugo chavez is a troublemaker in a big way he wants to work with iranian president ahmadinejad i watched his interview last night on anderson cooper and he calmly looked anderson cooper in the eyes and he gave a very warped view of history not even willing to acknowledge that the holocaust took place completely in denial you would have to wonder where in the world he gets his facts or his view of the world this is a troubling time in american history i say to young people everywhere i go the days ahead will be very very difficult we need to be honest with them about this but the character of this great nation was born out of the sacrifices the courage and the willingness to face these challenges of our grandparents and our greatgrand7 parents the greatest generation they are the standard for stepping up to meeting global challenges and they gave us our character we didnt get our character by the big buildings or wall street or wealth or even military power we got it by sacrifice and dedication and commitment and family and they are the standard they didnt cower or retreat from these challenges they stood up they faced them head on they showed us what it took to preserve freedom and extend it from one generation to the next and we must do the same thing we must come together as a nation i hate it that we are in the middle of this political campaign while we are at war because it is not good for us to say the things we say even on the floor of this house it is not good for lieutenant colonel hale and others to look back here and see the potshots being fired i hate it that over half of the democrats in the senate voted to remove saddam hussein by force and almost half of the democrats voted and now they all say it was a mistake let me tell you there has never been a pretty war never there has never been one perfectly executed and you do not remove a genocidal mass murderer with a picnic it is ugly and a brand new democracy takes a while to develop and it is tough tough but thank goodness that men and women in uniform will volunteer to go serve and carry out this tough mission and extend liberty from one generation to the next these are difficult days america needs to pull together i want to yield to my colleagues that have come tonight two of the people i respect the most in the house first the gentlewoman from north carolina e 1830 virginia foxx is a new member but you would never know it because she has got tons of experience and she has been down here standing up for what she believes day in and day out i want to yield to her on this most important issue of global security"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as summer turns towards winter the american people will continue to face high dprinted on recycled paper prices of gasoline and soon will face even higher costs for natural gas short of moving to florida or another warm weather state the american people are looking to congress to solve this problem recent events such as hurricanes katrina and rita have highlighted a very serious problem with the nations crude oil and gasoline supply demand balance one way to fix this balance is for the united states to increase its refining and production capacity no new refinery has been built in the united states in nearly 30 years total current capacity at operating refineries is 17 million barrels per day while total unitedstates demand is nearly 21 million barrels per day therefore the only way to bridge this gap is to increase the amount of imported refined products from foreign sources currently the unitedstates imports 7 9 percent of its total refined petroleum products by 2005 the unitedstates is expected to import 10 7 percent of its total these staggering numbers further underscore the dire need fornew and increased refining capacity in the united states if not we will continue to rely on unstable antiamerican governments to meet our growing demand for gasoline not only will this situation be a blow to economic growth in this country but it will also represent a serious national security risk for all of us even before hurricanes katrina and rita a number of market factors contributed to the record high gas prices an increased demand at honie and abroad political unrest in the middle east and in africa and product disruptions contributed to the already tightening supply of crude oil until refining capacity and production capacity grow faster than demand oil markets will remain tight and vulnerable to unforeseen and unpreventable events such as natural disasters the high cost of gasoline and other fuels has the potential to stifle economic and job growth and is putting a strain on the wallets of american families of course the most efficient way to reduce our dependence on oil and gas is to encourage conservation making sure your tires are inflated properly carpooling and using public transportation are all fast and easy ways to conserve gasoline in homes buying energyeffici6nt appliances and making sure doors and windows are properly sealed are effective ways to conserve but these are st4ortterm fixes curbing demand is necessary but in the long term it is not merely enough we need to increase domestic production of oil currently the unitedstates imports about 60 percent of all of its oil the department of energy projects this number to increase to 73 percent by the year 2025 in order to ensure reliable and secure supplies of oil we have no choice but to increase the domestic supply one way to increase production is to finally open anwr to oil and gas exploration in alaska the united states geological survey estimates that there is between 5 7 and 16 billion barrels of oil that is technically recoverable this estimate does not take into account that with new technology the share could become even higher a resource of this magnitude cannot simply be ignored anwr alone would be capable of reversing the decline in unitedstates petroleum supply within a decade it is not a quick fix there are no quick fixes but it is the quickest and most reliable option we now have to reverse the decline brought upon us by years of neglect of our domestic capacity in addition to gasoline oil and natural gas play a key role in the homes of all of us oil and natural gas help generate the electricity that powers lights appliances and entertainment systems they also provide the building block for plastics resealable food storage containers and durable appliances and electronics all of which contribute to a convenient and safe environment for all of us in closing even under the best circumstances storms like hurricanes katrina and rita would have had a noticeable impact on oil markets however at a time of extremely high demand and tight supplies practically shutting down the united states largest oil and refining region caused even greater pressure on our oil markets in order to alleviate this pressure we must increase our domestic refining capacity and production if not gasoline and home heating prices will continue to climb"]]}
