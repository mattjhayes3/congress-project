there will not be enough for any sort of mass distribution it is also my understanding that this distribution will not be used to further the commercial interests of your company the planting of these

including the construction of components of united states military hardware in yugoslavia and united states supply of sophisticated military material to enable yugoslavia to modernize its defense forces yugoslav sources explained that they could produce spare parts more cheaply than could united states plants unitedstates assistance to a communist dictatorship would seem selfdefeating but since the allied betrayal of general mihailovich and the forces struggling against the nazi and communist tyrannies in world war ii the united state department has perpetuated the notion that yugoslavia represents communism with a difference in this regard our state department treatment of yugoslav communism is similar to our state department treatment of romania the fiction is preserved that romania too is communism with a difference and despite its horrifying human rights record mostfavorednation treatment is allegedly a way of wooing ceaucescu from the soviet orbit our former ambassador to romania david funderburk in his book pinstripes and reds explodes this myth but not the momentum in the bowels of state that continues to push for such policies the yugoslavs can indeed produce united states military equipment more cheaply than can unitedstates plants workers on the production line at the yugo plant make as little as 25 cents an hour certainly this is a factor behind the anticipated mass strikes in yugoslavia this fall as it should be any american concerned about fair labor standards and unfair trade practices should keep this in mind before considering purchase of a yugo car given this grass exploitation moreover the communist dictators of yugoslavia share another common feature with ceaucescuthey are hopelessly corrupt while ceaucescu sells human beings who want to emigrate the communist officials in yugoslavia who are running state enterprises have fraudulently issued promissory notes to the tune of at least 2 billion for theirown personal h 8288 co

patient kept alive through such unitedstates life support systems as commercial and multinational lending institutions and preferential access to unitedstates markets yugoslavias outstanding world debt is pushing 19 billion their inflation rate is well over 100 percent and their unemployment stands at almost 17 percent small wonder then that yugoslav officials would salivate over the prospect of increased business with the united statesat the expense of united state jobs and security one must keep security in mind when dealing with any communist regime yugoslavia for example has maintained training camps for world terrorists have americans forgotten too that the architect of the achille lauro hijacking abu abbas was rescued and provided sanctuary in yugoslavia by that governments secret police this is the same government that sold minisubs to colonel qadhafi to be used against unitedstates ships in the mediterranean and cbs released on unconfirmed report that yugoslavia has sold sophisticated sea mines to the ayatollah khomeini to be used against american vessels in the persian gulf this is totally consistent behavior by an arms supplier to vietnam north korea angola nicaragua and the communist terrorists in el salvador there is also a confirmed report that the yugoslav government is producing sophisticated minirockets designed exclusively for the use of terrorists and it is as naive to believe that any yugoslav access to new technology is not immediately transferred to the soviet union as it is to believe that ceaucescu does not serve as an immediate conduit for the soviets if all of this were not enough the peoples militia in yugoslavia has responded to protests by everyone from students and intellectuals to workers and minorities with brutal

friend of the united states to accept our call to bear a fair share of the worlds defense burden the cost of protecting freedom and the free markets should be borne evenly and proportionally by those who benefit from them this resolution gives japan an option if the japanese government feels that it cannot exceed their politically established 1 percent of gross national product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national product on defense last year i must add that i am extremely concerned over the recent export violations by toshiba machine co inc of japan while the united states is spending billions on national security a security that as ive discussed accrues great benefit to the japanese toshiba sold sophisticated propeller manufacturing equipment expressly prohibited by law to the soviet union this sale and unbelievably its accompanying service contract approved by the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti served as a veritable stab in the back of all americans our nation which has stood as the rebuilder and protector of a nation which at one time struck out in a violent act of hostility against our nation 46 years ago views this sale of ship and submarine quieting technology which occurred twice with particular disdain i am pleased to see the substantive steps taken by the japanese to get to the heart of the toshiba problem and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a copy of a recent article by richard perle president reagans former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy regarding the toshiba machine incident h j res 327 joint resolution requiring the president or his designee to enter into negotiations with japan for the purpose of having japan bear a greater share of the free worlds defense burden by either increasing its annual defense expenditures to at least 3 percent of japans gross national product or by obtaining payment by japan to the united states of the difference between 3 percent of japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to protect and augment freedom democracy and capitalism throughout the world the global markets upon which exporting nations depend would not be available whereas the recent developments in the persian gulf bring to light once again the dependence of our allies on the united states for the protection of strategic international sea lanes so vital to the industrialized democracies whereas 37 percent of the oil consumed by the united

whereas 4 percent of the oil consumed by the united states and 60 percent of the oil consumed by japan passes through the gulf of hormuz whereas there have been disturbing revelations that the japanese company toshiba machine has on two occasions sold strategic technological equipment to the soviet union which gives the soviets the ability to reduce the noise level of their submarines by a factor of twenty significantly undermining the security of the united states and the rest of the free world whereas at a time when the necessary financial commitment to national security is particularly burdensome to the american economy given its increasing national debt the trade deficit relatively high interest rates and the erosion of united states manufacturing jobs this sale with the approval of the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti is looked on with particular disdain whereas in 1985 the united states spent 7 percent of its gnp on defense the soviet union spent 14 percent of its gnp on defense our european allies spent an average 3 5 percent of their gnp on defense and japan spent 1 of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963 trillion in 1986 and had an inflation rate of 1 percent and an unemployment rate of 2 8 percent during the same period whereas the united states overall trade deficit in 1986 was 166 3 billion and 50 billion in the first three months of 1987 and our trade deficit

bargaining and negotiating will be made to appear a capricious ephemeral impulse rather than the serious policy initiative the president intended what congress simply doesnt understand is that no president can defend our interests in this or any other matter if his policies can be snapped around like a rubber band the march so evident in congress and in such executive agencies as the department of commerce to weaken export controls is lumbering forward behind the banner of competitiveness this years slogan masquerading as a policy the fellows who want to keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic red tapea complaint that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige whose department dispenses red tape by the mile echoes happily at industry lunches and in congressional testimony now if mac would put the time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the western alliance the president who has taken the lead in arguing for effective export controls will appear pale and depleted if he falls to take charge of the kongsbergtoshlba affair and abandoning policies aimed at protecting our

legislative action to return four pivotal civil rights laws to their rightful status prior to two supreme court decisions which occurred on february 28 1984 these decisions were grove city college v bell secretary of education 104 s ct 1211 1984 and consolidated rail corporation v darrone 104 s ct 1248 1984 the civil rights restoration act is intended to reestablish the fundainental principle that when any part of an organizational entity receives federal financial assistance then all of the operations of that entity are subject to the antidiscrimination requirements contained in four civil rights statutes the four laws to which i refer are first title ix of the education amendments of 1972 second title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 third the rehabilitation act of 1973 and fourth the age discrimination act each of these laws prohibits discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance title ix prohibits discrimination based upon sex title vi prohibits discrimination based upon race color or national origin section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 prohibits discrimination based upon a persons disability the age discrimination act prohibits discrimination based upon an individuals age so if you choose to participate in federal programs and receive federal financial aid you must comply with the antidiscrimination requirements of all four of these laws this seems to me a patently logical and fundamentally fair result the federal government should not be in the business of subsidizing discriminationinadertently or otherwise if you choose to discriminate or ignore discriminatory activities within the realm of your organizational control then you will not be aided and abetted in doing so through the use of taxpayer moneys allow me to briefly review the problems presented by the supreme court decisions in grove city and darrone and to explain further why i believe remedial legislation is necessary grove city college a private coeducational liberal arts college refused to sign the assurance of compliance certification under title ix grove city college asserted that it received no federal financial assistancethat is that it was not a recipient under title ix and consequently was not subject to the discrimination prohibitions of that statute the facts in the case were that no direct federal assistance went to the college but that some of the students attending grove city college received federal basic educational opportunity grants the supreme court held first that grove city was a recipient under title ix because receiving federal financial assistance includes federal aid to a student who uses the funds at a particular institution but the supreme court went on to construe program or activity as not meaning the operations of the entire college but only the student financial aid office that is where the beog money in fact ultimately went on virtually the same day in the darrone case the supreme court also gave the same restrictive interpretation to program or activity in section 50 1 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 immediately there was a critical reaction to the narrow and potentially damaging interpretation given to program or activity in both of these decisions in an education context the supreme court interpretation means for example that if sex discrimination occurs in the history department of a college but no federal funds expressly go to that particularly department then the college could continue to receive federal assistance despite this discrimination importantly since the phrase program or activity is also present in title vi and the age discrination act that same programspecific construction could be applied in cases under those laws soon after the supreme court action legislation was introduced both in the senate and in the house of representative to respond to the gave city problem these bills were intended to restore the four relevant laws to their status prior to the grove city decision the house bill in the 98th congress was favorably reported by both the education and labor committee and the judiciary committee this legislation passed the house of representatives on june 26 1984 by a vote of 375 to 32 however disagreement over the intended and actual scope of the bills language resulted time ran out and the senate did not take final action that bill ran into difficulty principally because it contained a broad and arguably ambiguous definition of recipient the bills definition differed in certain respects from the existing regulatory definitions of recipient for each of the four laws concern was expressed that this legislation was in fact being used to expand the coverage of these four laws to entirely new categories or classes of recipients subsequent versions reflect a sincere attempt to respond to those early criticism s 557 the bill we consider today is based upon a substitute developed from weeks of bipartisan negotiations in the spring of 1985 those negotiationsinvolving democrats and republicans from from both tile judiciary committee and the education and labor committeebrought about important improvements in the bill under this revised and still relevant format the existing regulatory definitions of recipient are left unchanged and importantly the exclusions for ulti ate beneflciaries farmers student medicare and medicaid recipients food stamp recipients and social security beneficiarieswhich are contained in three out of four regulatory definitions are retained so for example entities or persons such as farmers that are not recipents under the law now because they are ultimate beneficiaries would not have their status changed furthermore s 557 defines the phrase program or activity and attempts to bring that definition in line with executive branch enforcement policy as it existed prior to grove city and darrone this makes good sense in that it was the supreme courts restrictive interpretation of that phrase which prompts our legislative reaction under s 557 coverage under the four antidiscrimination laws would extend to first departments or agencies of a state or a local government second colleges universities or public systems of higher education third local education agencies or other elementary or secondary systems fourth corporations partnerships or other private or nonprofit organizations and fifth any other entity established by two or more of those previous entities in the case of this last cater ory other entity coverage presumably would occur depending upon whether or not the resulting entity is analogous in structure and purpose to the previous categories in the specified list s 557 also intends to leave the socalled pinpointing doctrine on fund termination unchanged see senate report no 10064 p 20 the landmark case on pinpointing is taylor v finch 414 f 2d 1068 1969 that doctrine holds that once a program or activity is receiving federal financial assistance and discrimination is found to exist then only those funds which actually support the discrimination would be cut off so for example if a municipal housing authority is found to be discriminating on the basis of race or sex or age or handicap only housing moneys are potentially terminated by not transportaon moneys or education moneys while as a practical matter fund termination is a negotiation tool and is utilized only as a last resort the intent of this legislation is to limit the potential scope of fund termination to those funds which actually have a specific nexus to the discrimination that is found as the members of this house know progress on the civil rights restoration act has been stalled since early 1985 because of a dispute over the possible abortion implications of this legislation now with adoption of the df nforth amendment in the senate ard the inclusion of that abortion neutral language in the bill before us today that 3year impasse is over for many of us a compromise on the abortion issue was a necessary prerequisite to the enactment of this legislation while that debate was understandable and important its unfortunate side effect was to distract many members from focusing on the very valid and fundamental policy reasons justifying the remaining portions of the bill but now that this issue has been satisfactorily resolved let us not be further distracted with passage colleges and universities will not be able to receive federal aid and discriminate against women or blacks or the handicapped in their admissions policies or hiring practices state and local governments similarly cannot continue to receive financial aid without assuring federal enforcement officials about equal opportunity in employment and nondiscriminatory disposition of those funds components of corporations will also have to comply with the basic elements of the four applicable civil rights laws today the house of representatives is faced with a policy choice that should not and cannot ignore the original rationale that prompted the enactment of these four laws these statutes were intended as deterrents to institutional discrimination and that fact ought not be overlooked or aban doned in this debate ultimately the question for us to answer is whether or not we want these laws to be enforced in a comprehensive and effective manner"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "as i said on this floor repeatedly we are not going to win the war on drugs until we change the culture of america with respect to the use and toleration of drug use

hear on the floor of the house that we should excuse drug traffickers because they happen to be veterans i heard someone ask how can we take a particular benefit away from somebody when their service in vietnam drove them to trafficking in drugs is that the message you want to send forward do you want to send a message forward that in a courtroom in america that if someone is a drug trafficker they can say they got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore they are excused i am concerned about veterans of america and concerned about the vietnam veterans but more concerned about the young people of america today in this respect what i heard on the floor is that if a trafficker sells drugs to my son or your son or grandson that person ought to receive special treatment because that person happened to be a veteran we made an exemption because we understood the problem of drug usage among some that returned from vietnam you do not suffer the same disability under the mccollum amendment if you are merely using drugs and convicted of use if you happen to be a veteran they are therefore given a special exemption but when their action rises to the question of drug trafficking we say that at that we draw the line we dont take away your health benefit we dont take away your retirement benefit we protect those but other types of benefits we are going to subject to penalty why do we do that because we have tried the purely criminal sanction route and we have recognized that is not sufficient we have to send a message that is more than that we have to change the culture of america with respect to usage of drugs that is why the amendment is crucial it goes to the question of true user accountability unfortunately the rangel substitute guts the effectiveness of this crucial amendment this amendment may be more important than any other single amendment we have here because it reflects a change in attitude of our approach on the drug problem we can talk big we can have mandatory penalties but if we excuse the users as we have done time and time again if we now excuse the trafficker because the trafficker happens to be a veteran we are going to send the wrong message to america if we want to save this generation of young people if we want to save the next generation we have to do more than we have done before we have to establish user accountability and that means changing the rules of the game that we have had thus far is this something new absolutely the reason it is new is because we have a tragedy affecting far more people than affected us in the

sanctions bill there is no room in the world today for officially sanctioned racial discrimination apartheid is abhorrent and i agree that the united states should not stand by and ignore the continuation of this policy although i have always been a strong proponent of sanctions legislation and fully understand that south africa has made no visible progress in ending apartheid despite passage of previous sanctions legislation i have some serious reservations about this bill h r as the ranking republican on the banking committee let me address one problem in this bill with reepect to bank loans under this bill banks will not be able to reschedule existing loans with south africa because of the debt moratorium that south africa imposed after the first sanctions bill no payments are being made under original loan terms thus united states banks will have no other alternative then to sell the loans because they will become uncollectible under original terms the bottom line impact is that united states banks stand to lose over a billion dollars and our banks loss will become the south african governments gain it is inconceivable to me that the authors of this legislation would want to confer such a windfall on the south african government i should make the point that no new lending has occured since the last sanctions bill the only new money flowing into south africa has been shortterm trade financing which will be prevented under this bill additionally no new investment has been allowed either the first sanctions bill was a positive step forward which banned new banks loans but to allow the south africans to excuse their debt now is in my opinion not a sanction other provisions of the bill are also troublesome for instance unitedstates investors big and small may lose over a billion dollars because of the mandated disinvestment also the breaking of all intelligence ties between our two nations is mandated by this bill despite the strategic location of south africa t enetrage my colleagues to support tht 1roomfield alternative as a more sensiole in their approach to this problem we should seek allied strength if these sanctions are to be effective as the broomfield alternative suggests moreover thl burton substitute would specifically attempt to improve black economic power in south africa while maintaining the existing sanctions both of these objectives are laudableand notably lacking in h r 1580 h r 1580 in its present form is a solo effort because we do not have indications that other nations plan to follow our lead in the sanctions effort will blacks have more economic power if we pass this bill most likely notand therefore their leverage for change will diminish in the final analysis what we are doing here is simply sending a signal that we will have nothing to do with south africa it is a symbolic move and i can understand that approach but with respect to real economic harm to the south african government and economy i really dont believe that there will be any significant impact from the sanctions contained in h r 1580 as i mentioned i have supported sanctions in the past on every occasion i favor more punitive action against south africa but i believe that this legislation needs to be improved as it stands unitedstates banks and investors will be injured with no corresponding benefit or gain to the black majority in south africa moreover this legislation will provide a significant financial windfall for the south african government and i fall to understand how that is a sanction i am hopeful that the authors of this bill will set politics aside and support an improved meaningful sanctions bill"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "as one of the original cosponsors of aid to the homeless legislation introduced in the 100th congress i rise in support of the conference report the chairman of our subcommittee mr gonzalez deserves special praise for his leadership on the conference report before us today along with our chairman i would like to single out other important members and my colleagues on the banking committee mrs roukema the ranking republican on the subcommittee and mr vento they have all provided strong leadership contributions in designing and improving the basic homeless assistance programs enacted in the first session of the 100th congress for todays conference report the banking committees portion of the conference report provides only modest increased funding in fiscal year 1989 and 1990 for the three existing programs for the homeless fema emergency food and shelter program emergency shelter grant program and the transitional housing demonstration program as well as additional funding for the section 8 moderate rehabilitation for single room occupancy program a total of 410 1 million is authorized for fiscal year 1989 and 426 2 million for fiscal year 1990 for these homeless assistance programs under the banking committees jurisdiction the conference report contains several policy changes which are designed to improve the efficiency in delivering much needed homeless aid to state local and private nonprofit organizations such as encouragement for more technical assistance and improved coordination of information by state agencies greater flexibility has been provided by increasing from 15 percent to 20 percent the amounts of funds under the emergency shelter grant which may be used to provide essential services despite these positive changes still greater flexibility and local determination in my judgment is needed before the homeless assistance programs will truly reach their most effective potential homelessness is a diverse and essentially localized problem and the solutions therefore must be designed to provide such local discretion we would have preferred to see the acceptance of the ridge roukema block grant approach which was narrowly defeated by the house on august 3 which would have created maximum local flexibility for local communities in administering the mckinney act programs through a block grant system notwithstanding these reservations i believe that the conference report under consideration is on the right track and should receive our support this conference report also makes some modifications not directly related to homelessness which were necessary to provide technical and other clarifications to the housing and community development act of 1987 while these provisions at first appeared to be controversial with the administration i am now satisfied that the budgetary concerns expressed relating to changes in the section 8 program used in conjunction with huds loan management program have been significantly improved and their cost impact moderated sufficient to at least soften some of the administrations opposition this legislation is strongly supported by the united way the salvation army the national council of jewish federations the american red cross the national conference of catholic charities the national council of churches and by such organizations as the national mental health association the association for retarded citizens united cerebral palsy and the easter seal society these organizations represent only a few of the people who are in the front lines in our battle to end homelessness and i believe that they will make excellent use of the funds provided in the mcklnney act while title v of this act is not under the jurisdiction of the banking committee how section 501 is interpreted is a matter of great importance to our committee whether or not title v is interpreted as including single family properties in the fhas inventory has major implications for the solvency of the fha insurance funds section 501 of the mckinney act requires federal agencies to survey their buildings and real property to determine which are underutllized and might be available for the temporary shelter of the homeless nothing in section 501 or its legislative history in any way indicates that it was intended to apply to fha single family properties as i understand it the conference agreement contains language intended to ensure more rapid and effective use of unutilized and underutilized federal buildings however the conference agreement does not expand the universe of covered properties to include those in the fhas inventory of single family homes for this i commend the conferees as a recent unitedstates district court case has already shown an erroneous interpretation of title v can result in a freeze in fhas 3 billion annual sales program would place the insurance fund in jeopardy or force its dependence on appropriations while we must do all we can directly to assist the homeless we must be careful not to change unintentionally the basic nature of the fhas

house telecommunications and finance subcommittee during the recent hearing conducted on this legislation i was struck by one overriding impression the codification of the fairness doctrine cannot be justified unless one accepts the spectrum scarcity rationale sheer weight of numbers prevents me from accepting this argument there are now approximately 10 000 radio stations and 1 300 television stations reaching 98 2 percent of all unitedstates households with the availability of home dishes cable vcrs and microwave technology there are numerous sources of information for broadcast audiences to choose from although no one is even suggesting that we consider applying the fairness doctrine to newspapers it is interesting to contrast the broadcast numbers with the figures for the print media for example there are only 1 700 daily newspapers in this country and many major cities are only one or twopaper towns yet 96 percent of unitedstates households receive five or more television signals and 71 percent of all households receive nine or more signals in addition there are 7 300 cable systems reaching 46 percent of homes in the united states far from a scarcity the numbers indicate convincingly that the broadcast audience has a great many information alternatives available as my good friend the gentleman from iowa perceptively pointed out at the subcommittee hearing on h r 1934 in considering the spectrum scarcity rationale a distinction must be made between the availability of opportunities to broadcast programming and the availability of the opportunities to receive programming proponents of this bill have continually focused on the former distinction when the very purposes of the fairness doctrine command that we focus on the latter distinction i am concerned that enacting the fairness doctrine will intrude on the constitutional rights of broadcasters i see the fairness doctrine as a dangerous precedent of government regulation over content government officials should not be dictating broadcast contentthat should be determined solely by the tastes and information needs of the people the dial of the television set is a far more desirable regulatory

certain amendments added by the other body to the fair housing amendments act of 1988 my colleagues will recall that the house considered the fair housing legislation on june 22 and june 23 and finally approved the legislation on june 29 subsequently when the housepassed bill went to the other body a series of negotiations ensued to resolve the remaining differences between the civil rights community and the administration our purpose here today is to consider and hopefully accept the changes to h r 1158 adopted by the senate it should be pointed out that these changes have the support of the unitedstates department of housing and urban development the department of justice as well as key elements in the business community principally the national association of realtors and the national association of home builders the amendments adopted in the other body do no harm to the spirit of the balanced compromise approved by this house just a few weeks ago in fact many of these amendments serve to enhance and reinforce some of the provisions contained in that compromise for example many members of this house were concerned about the potential adverse impact that the coverage of families with children could have on senior citizens retirement communities under the language of one notable senate amendment existing senior citizen communities will have increased flexibility and possibility to qualify for the exemption from the familial status requirements just as important is the senateadded language providing a transition period for the current residents of housing that excludes children they will not be required to leave that housing nor will they be subject to eviction that is existing residents whose presence in a community or apartment complex might otherwise cause the community to fall outside the protections in section 807 b 2 will not be counted in calculating whether the exemption should apply the bottom line is that senior citizens retirement communities across the united states will have a greater chance of qualifying for the housing for older persons exemption furthermore no one will be evicted whether in a senior citizens community or an alladult community because of the enactment of this bill litigation authority was also an issue when we considered h r 1158 on this floor approximately 6 weeks ago the language contained in the bill before the house today fully consolidates in the department of justice the authority to represent the federal government in all of the enforcement actions under the fair housing act however while the litigation will be conducted by lawyers from the department of justice the decision as to whether or not prompt judicial action is necessary to obtain injunctive relief or to seek court enforcement of a finding of discriminatirn will still be lodged with the secretary of housing and urban development so under the latest compromise the secretary will decide whether or not litigation should occur where the secretary authorizes the litigation it is transmitted to the attorney general and lie is required to promptly commence and maintain such action consistent with the terms of the senate amendment the amended version of h r 1158 also contains a technical amendment to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies making it clear that certain interim certifications by hud are included in the bill the language adopted in the other body also makes it clear that this legislation is not requiring the establishment of a federal building code because of the accessibility and adaptability requirement for newly constructed multifamlly dwellings these and the other changes made in h r 1158 are improvements and refinements fully consistent with the spirit of the housepassed compromise bill we are in the final stretch run of a circuitous race that began nearly 10 years ago this bipartisan effortto strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1968 law and expand the coverage of the fair housing protections under title viii of the civil rights acthas tested the stamina of many of us in this house my good friend and distinguished colleague from california civil and constitutional rights subcommittee chairman don edwards in particular is to be commended for his patience determination and effective leadership in this effort we are on the threshold of finally passing a federal fair housing law that is workable and effective thirtysix million disabled persons will receive the protections of this fundamental civil rights statute families with children will no longer be arbitrarily limited in their choice of decent housing the secretary of hud will have new and significant powers to investigate discrimination complaints and to enforce the rights guaranteed under this statute if discrimination is found and proven state and local fair housing agencies will contintic their vital integral role in fair housing enforcement all across the united states the states and localities are given an adequate grace period to bring their statutes and ordinances in line with the new federal law so that

brought about a 65percent increase in the number of passengers flying over 460 million passengers are now flying it has created a tremendous overload on our aviation system but there is a solution an

trade legislation the issue of trade has been a subject that has been before the american people in everincreasing awareness for the last several years our trade deficits last year were almost 170 billion this year every indication is that a trade deficit of the united states will be significantly higher than that most of the emphasis of the proposed legislation focuses on the unfair trade practices which have been conducted and are being waged by some of our trading partners against the united states and our businesses i think that we need for a moment before we examine this legislation and get into the debate on the specifics of it to take a broader overview look at the entire question of trade at what some of these terms mean and what we might be doing to ourselves and to our trading partners if we take actions that we may not understand to begin with first of all unfair trade practices trade deficits and competitiveness are terms that are used frequently but they are not wellunderstood and they simply do not necessarily go together and interrelate for example we have had essentially the same or worse unfair trade practices used against us and our products and our services for quite a number of years when we had very large trade surpluses so unfair trade practices in and of themselves do not equate to huge trade deficits in the united states legislation that addresses unfair trade practices alone by no means is going to solve the trade deficit situation in this country i think we need to understand what the primary causes are of trade deficits the trade deficits at least that we have now now there can be other causes in other times but right now there are three primary causes of our trade deficits the first primary cause is the simple fact that the unitedstates economy and the consumer demand of this country over the last several years since 1981 has grown at a significantly greater rate than the growth of the economies and consumer demands of our trading partners the second reason why we have these huge trade deficits is because we have huge domestic budget deficits and we have not been able to do more than contain the growth of those domestic budget deficits we have not been able to reduce the deficits themselves the third primary cause of our trade deficits stems from the ever persistent third world debt and its direct relationship to our ability to trade now let us examine those three primary causes because they need to be understood if we are going to understand the legislation we are about to tackle in the next couple of days what about our growth our economy has grown since 1981 at a pretty rapid rate yes the inflation rates are down still we do not have that high gnp that everybody has been looking for but when you look around the world relative to the economies or the other parts of the world our economy has grown at a significantly more rapid rate than theirs when this occurs several things happen one our consumer demand and our business demand for that matter is up in other words our demand for products and services is greater than theirs and the natural consequence of this demand in a growing economy that is greater than the growth of the other parts of the world is that we are going to import more goods to meet this demand than we export we are going to have to import those goods because our economy has not been producing enough to meet this growth demand so it is only natural that we run a trade deficit in that situation it might not have to be as big as the one we have now but we cannot get around running that kind of a trade deficit until our economy picks up the slack in the system or until the foreign countries that we deal with have their economies pick up we need to have those countries cooperate a little bit with us if we are going to resolve the trade deficits the best way they could cooperate would be to get their own economies growing more rapidly we have encouraged them to do that but so far they have not the most obvious method of doing it particularly among the european allies is to reduce some of their tax burdens so their businesses can expand and their economies flow frankly they have an undue fear of the growth of inflation which is very low now we are almost in deflation in parts of the world we need them to do that but we cannot do it for them we cannot really force them to do that we can cajole them we can urge them we can do all kinds of things but we cannot absolutely get them to do that i suppose they could lower some of their interest rates which are already pretty low a little further they could do a number of things like that but until their demand comes up until they begin to grow at a greater pace than they are now we are going to have a natural pressure that is going to result in our having trade deficits that does not have anything to do with unfair trade practices and does not have anything to do with anything we can legislate about frankly now in the same context of these factors of growth relative growth between our country and our trading partners we have to think about how we finance this growth and how we finance at the same time these huge budget deficits we have with this greater growth relative to the other economies and with these huge deficits on our own side our budget deficits we require relatively higher interest rates than the rest of the world in order to get foreign capital to come over here and finance this for us because we do not have it inherently in our system again that is a natural equation in economics it is very simple it is fairly easily understood by those are involved though the language barriers often get in our way while our interest rates are nowhere near the extraordinarily high interest rates of 7 or 8 years ago when they went right through the ceiling we have had even though we had what we thought were modest rates of april 2 7 1987 congre maybe 7 v2

yugoslavia and united states supply of sophisticated military material to enable yugoslavia to modernize its defense forces yugoslav sources explained that they could produce spare parts more cheaply than could united states plants unitedstates assistance to a communist dictatorship would seem selfdefeating but since the allied betrayal of general mihailovich and the forces struggling against the nazi and communist tyrannies in world war ii the united state department has perpetuated the notion that yugoslavia represents communism with a difference in this regard our state department treatment of yugoslav communism is similar to our state department treatment of romania the fiction is preserved that romania too is communism with a difference and despite its horrifying human rights record mostfavorednation treatment is allegedly a way of wooing ceaucescu from the soviet orbit our former ambassador to romania david funderburk in his book pinstripes and reds explodes this myth but not the momentum in the bowels of state that continues to push for such policies the yugoslavs can indeed produce united states military equipment more cheaply than can unitedstates plants workers on the production line at the yugo plant make as little as 25 cents an hour certainly this is a factor behind the anticipated mass strikes in yugoslavia this fall as it should be any american concerned about fair labor standards and unfair trade practices should keep this in mind before considering purchase of a yugo car given this grass exploitation moreover the communist dictators of yugoslavia share another common feature with ceaucescuthey are hopelessly corrupt while ceaucescu sells human beings who want to emigrate the communist officials in yugoslavia who are running state enterprises have

lending institutions and preferential access to unitedstates markets yugoslavias outstanding world debt is pushing 19 billion their inflation rate is well over 100 percent and their unemployment stands at almost 17 percent small wonder then that yugoslav officials would salivate over the prospect of increased business with the united statesat the expense of united state jobs and security one must keep security in mind when dealing with any communist regime yugoslavia for example has maintained training camps for world terrorists have americans forgotten too that the architect of the achille lauro hijacking abu abbas was rescued and provided sanctuary in yugoslavia by that governments secret police this is the same government that sold minisubs to colonel qadhafi to be used against unitedstates ships in the mediterranean and cbs released on unconfirmed report that yugoslavia has sold sophisticated sea mines to the ayatollah khomeini to be used against american vessels in the persian gulf this is totally consistent behavior by an arms supplier to vietnam north korea angola nicaragua and the communist terrorists in el salvador there is also a confirmed report that the yugoslav government is producing sophisticated minirockets designed exclusively for the use of terrorists and it is as naive to believe that any yugoslav access to new technology is not immediately transferred to the soviet union as it is to believe that ceaucescu does not serve as an immediate conduit for the soviets if all of this were not enough the peoples militia in yugoslavia has responded

continued uncertainty in the middle east a sovietbacked vietnamese war in cambodia to name a few hot spots it is clear that the free world must rally together to defend our freedom the independence of our friends and allies and our global markets we call on japan a good friend of the united states to accept our call to bear a fair share of the worlds defense burden the cost of protecting freedom and the free markets should be borne evenly and proportionally by those who benefit from them this resolution gives japan an option if the japanese government feels that it cannot exceed their politically established 1 percent of gross national product we offer them a mechanism to meet their responsibilities they can pay the united states for the protective service we provide them perhaps that sounds unrealistic perhaps it sounds less than genteel or diplomatic but the defense spending imbalance between our two nations stands at the very heart of potential longterm problems between our two countries we must elevate the debate bring it into the public arena in our two countries and settle it in an equitable fashion there has been concern that the japanese constitution prohibits defense spending above 1 percent of gross national product this is not true this is a politically established limit as a matter of fact the japanese government spent 1 004 percent of their gross national product on defense last year i must add that i am extremely concerned over the recent export violations by toshiba machine co inc of japan while the united states is spending billions on national security a security that as ive discussed accrues great benefit to the japanese toshiba sold sophisticated propeller manufacturing equipment expressly prohibited by law to the soviet union this sale and unbelievably its accompanying service contract approved by the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti served as a veritable stab in the back of all americans our nation which has stood as the rebuilder and protector of a nation which at one time struck out in a violent act of hostility against our nation 46 years ago views this sale of ship and submarine quieting technology which occurred twice with particular disdain i am pleased to see the substantive steps taken by the japanese to get to the heart of the toshiba problem and ask that they take the message of this resolution as seriously a rapid and resolute response to this bill to the negotiations that i trust will ensue would mean the japanese have aligned themselves with strengthening democracy and security there are costs as well as benefits of being a global economic superpower it is time japan recognized and shared more of the costs it is simply not fair to the american people that we devote so much of our resources to being the protector of law and order in the world while japan is free to devote their resources to being the worlds producers and salesmen i include for the record the text of joint resolution 327 and a copy of a recent article by richard perle president reagans former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy regarding the toshiba machine incident h j res 327 joint resolution requiring the president or his designee to enter into negotiations with japan for the purpose of having japan bear a greater share of the free worlds defense burden by either increasing its annual defense expenditures to at least 3 percent of japans gross national product or by obtaining payment by japan to the united states of the difference between 3 percent of japans gross national product and what japan actually spends on defense whereas without freedom democracy and capitalism global economic vitality is diminished and individual markets diminish as well which is demonstrated by the far higher average gnp per capital for western market economies versus eastern socialist non market economies whereas without the military strength and the political resolve of the united states to protect and augment freedom democracy and capitalism throughout the world the global markets upon which exporting nations depend would not be available whereas the recent developments in the persian gulf bring to light once again the dependence of our allies on the united states for the protection of strategic international sea lanes so vital to the industrialized democracies whereas 37 percent of the oil consumed by the united states 100 percent of the oil consumed by japan 100 percent of the oil consumed by west germany 94 percent of the oil consumed by france and 100 percent of the oil consumed by italy is imported whereas 4 percent of the oil consumed by the united states and 60 percent of the oil consumed by japan passes through the gulf of hormuz whereas there have been disturbing revelations that the japanese company toshiba machine has on two occasions sold strategic technological equipment to the soviet union which gives the soviets the ability to reduce the noise level of their submarines by a factor of twenty significantly undermining the security of the united states and the rest of the free world whereas at a time when the necessary financial commitment to national security is particularly burdensome to the american economy given its increasing national debt the trade deficit relatively high interest rates and the erosion of united states manufacturing jobs this sale with the approval of the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti is looked on with particular disdain whereas in 1985 the united states spent 7 percent of its gnp on defense the soviet union spent 14 percent of its gnp on defense our european allies spent an average 3 5 percent of their gnp on defense and japan spent 1 of its gnp on defense whereas if the japanese spent 3 percent of their gnp on defense rather than 1 they would have spent an additional 39 billion on defense in 1986 money which would not be used to promote their civilian export industries and which over the last 5 years would have amounted to a staggering 139 billion whereas japan has the second largest economy in the world with a gnp of 1 963 trillion in 1986 and had an inflation rate of 1 percent and an unemployment rate of 2 8 percent during the same period whereas the united states overall trade deficit in 1986 was

simply doesnt understand is that no president can defend our interests in this or any other matter if his policies can be snapped around like a rubber band the march so evident in congress and in such executive agencies as the department of commerce to weaken export controls is lumbering forward behind the banner of competitiveness this years slogan masquerading as a policy the fellows who want to keep japanese computers out of the united states are allied with those who want to get them into the soviet union a selfserving industry lobby now argues that while it is harmful to national defense to import semiconductors from taiwan it is perfectly all right to ship them to moscow the competitiveness argument has it that in order for american industry to remain competitive we must equal the laxness with which our allies administer their export controls by diminishing the effectiveness of ours thus sinking to the lowest common denominator this is the central point of a shallow and tendentious study recently released by the national academy of sciences on which opponents of export controls have relied heavily in their irresponsible campaign to weaken them it seems not to have occurred to those who hold this view that is might be wiser to bring others up to our standard rather than haul us down to theirs how many more toshibas will it take before the allure of irresponsibilitly ceases to attract the national association of manufacturers and the business roundtable the business community complains with some validity that export controls entail bureaucratic red tapea complaint that commerce secretary malcolm baldrige whose department dispenses red tape by the mile echoes happily at industry lunches and in congressional testimony now if mac would put the time effort and resources into running the licensing function of the commerce department with even minimal competence we could get rid of the red tape without shipping our technology to the red army that is what defense secretary caspar weinberger and deputy undersecretary stephen bryen have done at the pentagon where they have treated technology control with the seriousness it merits and built an organization that can protect both trade and national security the greatest single service that government could provide to american exporters would be an efficient consistent and effective system for processing license requests expeditiously coupled with a vigorous campaign to get our allies to play by and enforce the same rules replacing the bonker and heinz measures with congressional support for administering export controls efficiently would be a good place to begin and legislation to bar toshiba and kongsberg from doing business in the united states would work wonders in getting our allies to enforce the rules they claim to respect much of what animates the white house these days has to do with issues of consistency and credibility values vital to our leadership of the

stand here today for 4 years i have supported legislative action to return four pivotal civil rights laws to their rightful status prior to two supreme court decisions which occurred on february 28 1984 these decisions were grove city college v bell secretary of education 104 s ct 1211 1984 and consolidated rail corporation v darrone 104 s ct 1248 1984 the civil rights restoration act is intended to reestablish the fundainental principle that when any part of an organizational entity receives federal financial assistance then all of the operations of that entity are subject to the antidiscrimination requirements contained in four civil rights statutes the four laws to which i refer are first title ix of the education amendments of 1972 second title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 third the rehabilitation act of 1973 and fourth the age discrimination act each of these laws prohibits discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance title ix prohibits discrimination based upon sex title vi prohibits discrimination based upon race color or national origin section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 prohibits discrimination based upon a persons disability the age discrimination act prohibits discrimination based upon an individuals age so if you choose to participate in federal programs and receive federal financial aid you must comply with the antidiscrimination requirements of all four of these laws this seems to me a patently logical and fundamentally fair result the federal government should not be in the business of subsidizing discriminationinadertently or otherwise if you choose to discriminate or ignore discriminatory activities within the realm of your organizational control then you will not be aided and abetted in doing so through the use of taxpayer moneys allow me to briefly review the problems presented by the supreme court decisions in grove city and darrone and to explain further why i believe remedial legislation is necessary grove city college a private coeducational liberal arts college refused to sign the assurance of compliance certification under title ix grove city college asserted that it received no federal financial assistancethat is that it was not a recipient under title ix and consequently was not subject to the discrimination prohibitions of that statute the facts in the case were that no direct federal assistance went to the college but that some of the students attending grove city college received federal basic educational opportunity grants the supreme court held first that grove city was a recipient under title ix because receiving federal financial assistance includes federal aid to a student who uses the funds at a particular institution but the supreme court went on to construe program or activity as not meaning the operations of the entire college but only the student financial aid office that is where the beog money in fact ultimately went on virtually the same day in the darrone case the supreme court also gave the same restrictive interpretation to program or activity in section 50 1 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 immediately there was a critical reaction to the narrow and potentially damaging interpretation given to program or activity in both of these decisions in an education context the supreme court interpretation means for example that if sex discrimination occurs in the history department of a college but no federal funds expressly go to that particularly department then the college could continue to receive federal assistance despite this discrimination importantly since the phrase program or activity is also present in title vi and the age discrination act that same programspecific construction could be applied in cases under those laws soon after the supreme court action legislation was introduced both in the senate and in the house of representative to respond to the gave city problem these bills were intended to restore the four relevant laws to their status prior to the grove city decision the house bill in the 98th congress was favorably reported by both the education and labor committee and the judiciary committee this legislation passed the house of representatives on june 26 1984 by a vote of 375 to 32 however disagreement over the intended and actual scope of the bills language resulted time ran out and the senate did not take final action that bill ran into difficulty principally because it contained a broad and arguably ambiguous definition of recipient the bills definition differed in certain respects from the existing regulatory definitions of recipient for each of the four laws concern was expressed that this legislation was in fact being used to expand the coverage of these four laws to entirely new categories or classes of recipients subsequent versions reflect a sincere attempt to respond to those early criticism s 557 the bill we consider today is based upon a substitute developed from weeks of bipartisan negotiations in the spring of 1985 those negotiationsinvolving democrats and republicans from from both tile judiciary committee and the education and labor committeebrought about important improvements in the bill under this revised and still relevant format the existing regulatory definitions of recipient are left unchanged and importantly the exclusions for ulti ate beneflciaries farmers student medicare and medicaid recipients food stamp recipients and social security beneficiarieswhich are contained in three out of four regulatory definitions are retained so for example entities or persons such as farmers that are not recipents under the law now because they are ultimate beneficiaries would not have their status changed furthermore s 557 defines the phrase program or activity and attempts to bring that definition in line with executive branch enforcement policy as it existed prior to grove city and darrone this makes good sense in that it was the supreme courts restrictive interpretation of that phrase which prompts our legislative reaction under s 557 coverage under the four antidiscrimination laws would extend to first departments or agencies of a state or a local government second colleges universities or public systems of higher education third local education agencies or other elementary or secondary systems fourth corporations partnerships or other private or nonprofit organizations and fifth any other entity established by two or more of those previous entities in the case of this last cater ory other entity coverage presumably would occur depending upon whether or not the resulting entity is analogous in structure and purpose to the previous categories in the specified list s 557 also intends to leave the socalled pinpointing doctrine on fund termination unchanged see senate report no 10064 p 20 the landmark case on pinpointing is taylor v finch 414 f 2d 1068 1969 that doctrine holds that once a program or activity is receiving federal financial assistance and discrimination is found to exist then only those funds which actually support the discrimination would be cut off so for example if a municipal housing authority is found to be discriminating on the basis of race or sex or age or handicap only housing moneys are potentially terminated by not transportaon moneys or education moneys while as a practical matter fund termination is a negotiation tool and is utilized only as a last resort the intent of this legislation is to limit the potential scope of fund termination to those funds which actually have a specific nexus to the discrimination that is found as the members of this house know progress on the civil rights restoration act has been stalled since early 1985 because of a dispute over the possible abortion implications of this legislation now with adoption of the df nforth amendment in the senate ard the inclusion of that abortion neutral language in the bill before us today that 3year impasse is over for many of us a compromise on the abortion issue was a necessary prerequisite to the enactment of this legislation while that debate was understandable and important its unfortunate side effect was to distract many members from focusing on the very valid and fundamental policy reasons justifying the remaining portions of the bill but now that this issue has been satisfactorily resolved let us not be further distracted with passage colleges and universities will not be able to receive federal aid and discriminate against women or blacks or the handicapped in their admissions policies or hiring practices state and local governments similarly cannot continue to receive financial aid without assuring federal enforcement officials about equal opportunity in employment and nondiscriminatory disposition of those funds components of corporations will also have to comply with the basic elements of the four applicable civil rights laws today the house of representatives is faced with a policy choice that should not and cannot ignore the original rationale that prompted the enactment of these four laws these statutes were intended as deterrents to institutional discrimination and that fact ought not be overlooked or aban doned in this debate ultimately the question for us to answer is whether or not we want these laws to be enforced in a comprehensive and effective manner"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as i said on this floor repeatedly we are not going to win the war on drugs until we change the culture of america with respect to the use and toleration of drug use we can point all the fingers we want to mexico to other south and central american countries to the golden triangle and other parts of the world we can say all we want to about how one administration or another has not done enough or states have not done enough but we arp not really going to get to the crux of the problem until we have a comprehensive approach which involves for the very first time a recognition of the fact that until you change the attitude toward drug users in this country you are not going to change the equation that presently exists i ask simply what is the impact on the young people of today when they see professional football players slapped on the wrist for 30 days and supposedly beginning their drug rehabilitation by playing golf what do they think when they hear on the floor of the house that we should excuse drug traffickers because they happen to be veterans i heard someone ask how can we take a particular benefit away from somebody when their service in vietnam drove them to trafficking in drugs is that the message you want to send forward do you want to send a message forward that in a courtroom in america that if someone is a drug trafficker they can say they got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore they are excused i am concerned about veterans of america and concerned about the vietnam veterans but more concerned about the young people of america today in this respect what i heard on the floor is that if a trafficker sells drugs to my son or your son or grandson that person ought to receive special treatment because that person happened to be a veteran we made an exemption because we understood the problem of drug usage among some that returned from vietnam you do not suffer the same disability under the mccollum amendment if you are merely using drugs and convicted of use if you happen to be a veteran they are therefore given a special exemption but when their action rises to the question of drug trafficking we say that at that we draw the line we dont take away your health benefit we dont take away your retirement benefit we protect those but other types of benefits we are going to subject to penalty why do we do that because we have tried the purely criminal sanction route and we have recognized that is not sufficient we have to send a message that is more than that we have to change the culture of america with respect to usage of drugs that is why the amendment is crucial it goes to the question of true user accountability unfortunately the rangel substitute guts the effectiveness of this crucial amendment this amendment may be more important than any other single amendment we have here because it reflects a change in attitude of our approach on the drug problem we can talk big we can have mandatory penalties but if we excuse the users as we have done time and time again if we now excuse the trafficker because the trafficker happens to be a veteran we are going to send the wrong message to america if we want to save this generation of young people if we want to save the next generation we have to do more than we have done before we have to establish user accountability and that means changing the rules of the game that we have had thus far is this something new absolutely the reason it is new is because we have a tragedy affecting far more people than affected us in the vietnam war remember more people were killed or destroyed by drug use than were killed in the vietnam war"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as i stated 2 years ago when the house was debating h r 1460 th first sanctions bill there is no room in the world today for officially sanctioned racial discrimination apartheid is abhorrent and i agree that the united states should not stand by and ignore the continuation of this policy although i have always been a strong proponent of sanctions legislation and fully understand that south africa has made no visible progress in ending apartheid despite passage of previous sanctions legislation i have some serious reservations about this bill h r as the ranking republican on the banking committee let me address one problem in this bill with reepect to bank loans under this bill banks will not be able to reschedule existing loans with south africa because of the debt moratorium that south africa imposed after the first sanctions bill no payments are being made under original loan terms thus united states banks will have no other alternative then to sell the loans because they will become uncollectible under original terms the bottom line impact is that united states banks stand to lose over a billion dollars and our banks loss will become the south african governments gain it is inconceivable to me that the authors of this legislation would want to confer such a windfall on the south african government i should make the point that no new lending has occured since the last sanctions bill the only new money flowing into south africa has been shortterm trade financing which will be prevented under this bill additionally no new investment has been allowed either the first sanctions bill was a positive step forward which banned new banks loans but to allow the south africans to excuse their debt now is in my opinion not a sanction other provisions of the bill are also troublesome for instance unitedstates investors big and small may lose over a billion dollars because of the mandated disinvestment also the breaking of all intelligence ties between our two nations is mandated by this bill despite the strategic location of south africa t enetrage my colleagues to support tht 1roomfield alternative as a more sensiole in their approach to this problem we should seek allied strength if these sanctions are to be effective as the broomfield alternative suggests moreover thl burton substitute would specifically attempt to improve black economic power in south africa while maintaining the existing sanctions both of these objectives are laudableand notably lacking in h r 1580 h r 1580 in its present form is a solo effort because we do not have indications that other nations plan to follow our lead in the sanctions effort will blacks have more economic power if we pass this bill most likely notand therefore their leverage for change will diminish in the final analysis what we are doing here is simply sending a signal that we will have nothing to do with south africa it is a symbolic move and i can understand that approach but with respect to real economic harm to the south african government and economy i really dont believe that there will be any significant impact from the sanctions contained in h r 1580 as i mentioned i have supported sanctions in the past on every occasion i favor more punitive action against south africa but i believe that this legislation needs to be improved as it stands unitedstates banks and investors will be injured with no corresponding benefit or gain to the black majority in south africa moreover this legislation will provide a significant financial windfall for the south african government and i fall to understand how that is a sanction i am hopeful that the authors of this bill will set politics aside and support an improved meaningful sanctions bill"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as one of the original cosponsors of aid to the homeless legislation introduced in the 100th congress i rise in support of the conference report the chairman of our subcommittee mr gonzalez deserves special praise for his leadership on the conference report before us today along with our chairman i would like to single out other important members and my colleagues on the banking committee mrs roukema the ranking republican on the subcommittee and mr vento they have all provided strong leadership contributions in designing and improving the basic homeless assistance programs enacted in the first session of the 100th congress for todays conference report the banking committees portion of the conference report provides only modest increased funding in fiscal year 1989 and 1990 for the three existing programs for the homeless fema emergency food and shelter program emergency shelter grant program and the transitional housing demonstration program as well as additional funding for the section 8 moderate rehabilitation for single room occupancy program a total of 410 1 million is authorized for fiscal year 1989 and 426 2 million for fiscal year 1990 for these homeless assistance programs under the banking committees jurisdiction the conference report contains several policy changes which are designed to improve the efficiency in delivering much needed homeless aid to state local and private nonprofit organizations such as encouragement for more technical assistance and improved coordination of information by state agencies greater flexibility has been provided by increasing from 15 percent to 20 percent the amounts of funds under the emergency shelter grant which may be used to provide essential services despite these positive changes still greater flexibility and local determination in my judgment is needed before the homeless assistance programs will truly reach their most effective potential homelessness is a diverse and essentially localized problem and the solutions therefore must be designed to provide such local discretion we would have preferred to see the acceptance of the ridge roukema block grant approach which was narrowly defeated by the house on august 3 which would have created maximum local flexibility for local communities in administering the mckinney act programs through a block grant system notwithstanding these reservations i believe that the conference report under consideration is on the right track and should receive our support this conference report also makes some modifications not directly related to homelessness which were necessary to provide technical and other clarifications to the housing and community development act of 1987 while these provisions at first appeared to be controversial with the administration i am now satisfied that the budgetary concerns expressed relating to changes in the section 8 program used in conjunction with huds loan management program have been significantly improved and their cost impact moderated sufficient to at least soften some of the administrations opposition this legislation is strongly supported by the united way the salvation army the national council of jewish federations the american red cross the national conference of catholic charities the national council of churches and by such organizations as the national mental health association the association for retarded citizens united cerebral palsy and the easter seal society these organizations represent only a few of the people who are in the front lines in our battle to end homelessness and i believe that they will make excellent use of the funds provided in the mcklnney act while title v of this act is not under the jurisdiction of the banking committee how section 501 is interpreted is a matter of great importance to our committee whether or not title v is interpreted as including single family properties in the fhas inventory has major implications for the solvency of the fha insurance funds section 501 of the mckinney act requires federal agencies to survey their buildings and real property to determine which are underutllized and might be available for the temporary shelter of the homeless nothing in section 501 or its legislative history in any way indicates that it was intended to apply to fha single family properties as i understand it the conference agreement contains language intended to ensure more rapid and effective use of unutilized and underutilized federal buildings however the conference agreement does not expand the universe of covered properties to include those in the fhas inventory of single family homes for this i commend the conferees as a recent unitedstates district court case has already shown an erroneous interpretation of title v can result in a freeze in fhas 3 billion annual sales program would place the insurance fund in jeopardy or force its dependence on appropriations while we must do all we can directly to assist the homeless we must be careful not to change unintentionally the basic nature of the fhas vital insurance programs which have provided home ownership opportunities to 17 million

compelling arguments for not codifying the fairness doctrine as i listened to the panelists that came before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee during the recent hearing conducted on this legislation i was struck by one overriding impression the codification of the fairness doctrine cannot be justified unless one accepts the spectrum scarcity rationale sheer weight of numbers prevents me from accepting this argument there are now approximately 10 000 radio stations and 1 300 television stations reaching 98 2 percent of all unitedstates households with the availability of home dishes cable vcrs and microwave technology there are numerous sources of information for broadcast audiences to choose from although no one is even suggesting that we consider applying the fairness doctrine to newspapers it is interesting to contrast the broadcast numbers with the figures for the print media for example there are only 1 700 daily newspapers in this country and many major cities are only one or twopaper towns yet 96 percent of unitedstates households receive five or more television signals and 71 percent of all households receive nine or more signals in addition there are 7 300 cable systems reaching 46 percent of homes in the united states far from a scarcity the numbers indicate convincingly that the broadcast audience has a great many information alternatives available as my good friend the gentleman from iowa perceptively pointed out at the subcommittee hearing on h r 1934 in considering the spectrum scarcity rationale a distinction must be made between the availability of opportunities to broadcast programming and the availability of the opportunities to receive programming proponents of this bill have continually focused on the former distinction when the very purposes of the fairness doctrine command that we focus on the latter distinction i am concerned that enacting the fairness doctrine will intrude on the constitutional rights of broadcasters i see the fairness doctrine as a dangerous precedent of government regulation over content government officials should not be dictating broadcast contentthat should be determined solely by the tastes and information needs of the people the dial of the television set is a far more desirable regulatory tool than a vague concept of fairness enforced by a government agency"]]}
