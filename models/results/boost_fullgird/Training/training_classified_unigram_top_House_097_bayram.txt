1 7 million franklin roosevelt spent 82 7 million john kennedy spent 210 5 million and jimmy carter spent 1 3 billion it took 186 years to raise the annual federal spending to a level of 100 billion

exceeded 500 billion in fiscal year 1980 600 billion in fiscal year 1981 and are projected to exceed 700 billion in fiscal year 1982 if this is not enough to convince the members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment the very fact that the amount of federal spending per average household increased 46 percent during the 4 years of the carter administrationfrom 5 026 in fiscal year 1976 to 7 329 in fiscal 1980 is alarming and not

unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an

negotiated with the soviet union it was this concern over verifiability which caused me in 1977 to seek amendment of the arms control and disarmament act and firmly establish the principle of verification in our arms limitation agreements that amendment passed overwhelmingly and requires among other things that the director of the arms control and disarmament agency acda now simply renamed in this bill the arms control agency to report on a timely basis or upon a request by an appropriate committee of the congress on the number of professional government personnel assigned on a full time basis to arms control verification he is also required by the amendment to report on the amount and percentage of research funds expended by acda for the purpose of analyzing issues relating to arms control verification most importantly the amendment also requires the director to determine whether arms control proposals can be verified as well as whether there has been any decrease in unitedstates capacity to verify an existing arms control agreement or treaty the subcommittee on international security and scientific affairs has thus received from acda periodic reports on the numbers of professional government personnel assigned to arms control verification and the amounts and percentage of research funds spent by acda to analyze issues relating to verification meetings

years we have been writing checks and we have not backed them up with the funds president reagan was elected to suggest that we ought to change that practice that we ought to actually cut here instead of promising everything to everybody as some wellintentioned individuals in our society do and then attempting to buy things that we cannot afford the question before us is which of these proposals better does that job to make us refrain from what we have done in the past and to begin anew this morning i picked up the washington post and i think it was very simply put by a writer she said that the proposal from the committee would stop writing checks for a year president reagan and his allies would throw away the checkbook entirely and that is really what we are talking about the grammlatta

fulfill those promises and we can back them up with money now why is that important it is important because every time we kite a chieck in the federal government what we do is we weaken the amount of money that is in the pocket of every american citizen and who do we especially weaken we especially weaken those people on fixed incomes particularly the elderly in this country because when we depress the value of the dollar they have in their pockets they can buy far far less than they could before and we may feel good about saying we in government will bail you out but we never bail them

outlined a new idea his administration would pursue for creating jobs and economic opportunity in americas inner cities enterprise zones in a rose garden ceremony today the president fulfilled that promise by formally sending an enterprise zone proposal to congress this bill will be introduced in the house of representatives within the next few days by my good friend and very able colleague barber conable along with bon garcia myself and a bipartisan coalition of members of congress what we need now is a sense of urgency about passing this legislation both in the administration and in the house and senate not only is unemployment at its highest level since the second world war in the nation as a whole it is twice as high in our inner cities and three times as high for mi norities as a nationand as a congresswe cannot and must not tolerate this tragic waste of human potential i would like to urge my colleagues particularly those who sit on the taxwriting committees of the house of representatives and the senate to move forward quickly to consider and pass this legislation we need to send a strong signal to the people of our inner cities that they are not the chosen victims of recession that their jobs are not the price we are trying to pay for reducing inflation let me also take this opportunity to repeat some points that bos garcia march 2 1 982 bill gray and i have raised over and over during the 2 years we have been sponsoring enterprise zones legislation in this congress first of all let me repeat once more that enterprise zones do not have some hidden agenda of eliminating government programs within enterprise zones in fact both the kempgarciagray bill and the new bill make it very explicit that federal money can be used for projects included in a state and local enterprise zone program neither are enterprise zones an attempt to return to the days when the government took no responsibility for protecting people against dirty air and water unsafe living and working conditions or racial discrimination while the enterprise zone proposal establishes a procedure for reducing the paperwork burden on workers and entrepreneurs within enterprise zones it expressly prohibits any regulatory changes that would threaten health safety or the environment or relax civil rights protections enterprise ones dont kick government out of enterprise zones they can however accomplish some things that government by its very nature cannot we now know that a large majority of new jobsvirtually all new jobs in our central citiesare created by small entrepreneurial businesses yet as dr david birch of mit has pointed out the firms that can and do generate the most jobs are the ones most difficult to reach through conventional policy initiatives the very spirit that gives them their vitality and jobcreating powers is the same spirit that makes them unpromising partners for the development administrator in order to reach these entrepreneurial firms as well as larger and more established firms we need to develop a program which can adapt to the rapidly changing uncertain environment of the entrepreneur this is hard to do with direct federal money especially because 75 percent of all new businesses start without using any outside capital at all either from government or from formal financial institutions like banks instead they start businesses with personal savings or with money borrowed from family and friends the challenge then becomes encouraging these entrepreneurs to take a chance in the riskier environment of the inner city by providing more general incentivesincentives that an entrepreneur can use without being directly identified by the government i believe the easiest and most direct way to accomplish this is to use tax incentives to offset the inner citys greater risks with greater aftertax rewards but that an entrepreneurial decisions are not limited to people who start up businesses everyone rich or poor makes economic calculations and we cannot escape the fact that far too many people in the inner have calculated that between the loss of welfare benefits the onset of taxes and the lack of tangible longterm opportunities in their own communities it just is not worth taking the chance on a job enterprise zones seek to change that that an entrepreneurial calculation as well by providing a tax incentive for employees who take a job in an enterprise zone and for employers who offer jobs to disadvantaged workers finally and with all due respect to president reagan i do not agree with the notion that enterprise zones are an experiment if we are going to affect the entrepreneurial calculations of thousands of workers and employers we cannot be talking about experiments as if we are offering incentives one day and will take them away the next in fact enterprise zones stand out from other federal urban programs in offering a longterm policy not a shortterm experiment that will be changed every few years before it really gets a chance to work people make their decisions in the long run if they did not no one would ever start up a small business as small businesses do not make money for their first 4 or 5 years neither would an employer or worker ever take a chance on job training or education because enterprise zones offer tax incentives over the 25year life of the zone they give individuals a real incei tive to make the kind of longterm capital investmentin human capital as well as equipment or propertythat will make a real difference in americas poorest communities a brief

federal outlays exceeded 500 billion in fiscal year 1980 600 billion in fiscal year 1981 and are projected to exceed 700 billion in fiscal year 1982 if this is not enough to convince the members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment the very fact that the amount of federal spending per average household increased 46 percent during the 4 years of the carter administrationfrom 5 026 in fiscal year 1976 to 7 329 in fiscal 1980 is alarming and not acceptable to the american taxpayer ii18319 without a spending limitation members of congress can accommodate one spending interest and gain political capital without reducing other spending programs and facing political disadvantages the political costs of excessive spending are deferred resulting in high inflation huge deficits and higher taxes while the political benefits of the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congessmen who support it a similar process and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely noticeable but when the costs of all the programs are added the impact is severe the requirements of balancing the budget and limiting the growth in spending will give the taxpayers an qual opportunity to influence spending discussions through the ballot box under the balancedbudget amendment congressmen will be forced to remain aware of public opinion because the votes for deficit spending and tax increases will be voted directly on those issues this should result in an examination of priorities when programs are considered the spending limitation will force congress to make choices which should lead to more efficient government the american people are demanding that congress balance the budget today we have the opportunity to carry out the will of the people and this is one congressman who will be voting to support the people of this country it is clear that the american budget process is seriously

agree ments it negotiated with the soviet union it was this concern over verifiability which caused me in 1977 to seek amendment of the arms control and disarmament act and firmly establish the principle of verification in our arms limitation agreements that amendment passed overwhelmingly and requires among other things that the director of the arms control and disarmament agency acda now simply renamed in this bill the arms control agency to report on a timely basis or upon a request by an appropriate committee of the congress on the number of professional government personnel assigned on a full time basis to arms control verification he is also required by the amendment to report on the amount and percentage of research funds expended by acda for the purpose of analyzing issues relating to arms control verification most importantly the amendment also requires the director to determine whether arms control proposals can be verified as well as whether there has been any decrease in unitedstates capacity to verify an existing arms control agreement or treaty the subcommittee on international security and scientific affairs has thus received from acda periodic reports on the numbers of professional government personnel assigned to arms control verification and the amounts and percentage of research funds spent by acda to analyze issues relating to verification

years we have been writing checks and we have not backed them up with the funds president reagan was elected to suggest that we ought to change that practice that we ought to actually cut here instead

fulfill those promises and we can back them up with money now why is that important it is important because every time we kite a chieck in the federal government what we do is we weaken the amount of money that is in the pocket of every american citizen and who do we especially weaken we especially weaken those people on fixed incomes particularly the elderly in this country because when we depress the value of the dollar they have in their pockets they can buy far far less than they could before and we may feel good about saying we in government will bail you out but we never bail them
