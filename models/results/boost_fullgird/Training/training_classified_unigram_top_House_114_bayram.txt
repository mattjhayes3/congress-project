for the time today and also for taking me to your district and seeing that part of the border our trip a few weeks ago was great enlightening to me i have spent a lot of time crisscrossing those 820 miles of the border and it was great to see how the san diego sector and tucson and my fellow texans in mcallen are doing the same thing as the gentlewoman knows i spent 9 years as an undercover officer in the cia i chased groups like al qaeda and the taliban i have chased narcotraffickers all over the world and the threat is increasing and the threat is sophisticated the drug trafficking organizations in mexico are making 50 billion a year in the united states that is a big number their tactics techniques and procedures are sophisticated and we need to keep up it is about moves and countermoves what i like about this bill is it empowers our members of border patrol to do their job a lot of people talk about border security i like to refine it a little bit part of it is interdiction stopping people before they get to the border it is grabbing them it is having them in custody and then it is removal this bill is focused on this first piece of border security which is interdiction we need to make sure that our men and women that are on the border every single day have the tools that they need in order to do their job it is different in tucson it is different in eagle pass it is different in san diego what i like about this bill that was developed under the leadership of chairman mccaul is that it gives them that freedom and flexibility having spent a lot of time overseas i know the disconnect between the field and headquarters and that is going on right here on our border we need to make sure that the guys and gals that are on the border have the tools that they need this is a sophisticated threat as you alluded to using ultralight aircraft to deliver their payload they are using tactics that intelligence organizations have used all across the world to do denial and deception we need to make sure we have all the resourcesthings like the aerostats things like radar technology things like uavsin order to have that combined picture of the border this is something that for 19 months i talked to folks in the district i know like you this was a very important issue the american people sent us up here to do our job and our job is to protect our citizens and to protect our homeland this bill does it it is a strong bill and i look forward to working over these next few days and weeks in order to make this happen"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a costbenefit analysis prior to the implementation of a regulation requires a number of assumptions that make an accurate analysis difficult if not impossible h r 50 allows committee chairmen and ranking members to ask for the retrospective reviews of specific regulations i think there needs to be a degree of deference and some respect for the idea that it is for committee chairmen and ranking members both sides of the aisle not just based on some whim i think it is offensive to suggest that it be just some whimsical thing this allows an important check on any preimplementation costbenefit analysis and these retrospective reviews better clarify the true costs of regulation even president obama supports retrospective reviews and issued an executive order requiring agencies to conduct them more importantly retrospective reviews work in april of 2014 the gao issued a report on retrospective reviews at 22 executive agencies that report found that more than 90 percent of retrospective regulation reviews led the agencies to revise clarify or eliminate regulation text90 percent however the pace of retrospective review is much slower than planned and the 22 agencies reviewed by the gao had plans to conduct more than 650 retrospective reviews but had only completed 246 of them as of august of as you can see the agencies are already doing this work it is good to go back and review we shouldnt be afraid of that we should encourage it this provision in the bill simply allows congress to work with agencies to prioritize regulatory areas most important to the american taxpayer we need to maintain the ability to make such requests and i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a few weeks ago i had the pleasure of going to the 50th anniversary commemoration of the vietnam war in little rock and to see all the hugs and emotion at that event truly it was a tumultuous time in our world it was so good to see the healing that those men and women experienced at that 50th anniversary i looked at that table set for the pow mia ceremony and of course i was thinking about sergeant harold george bennett from perryville arkansas sergeant bennett was born on october 16 1940 in thornburg arkansas a very small town outside the beautiful ouachita national forest a graduate of perryville high school he enlisted in the unitedstates army in 1957 he served as an airborne infantryman with the 82nd and 101st airborne divisionsno finer units he completed special forces training in 1963 from there sergeant bennett volunteered to go to south vietnam as a special forces adviser with the military assistance command on december 29 1964 his unit was airlifted to a small village after it had been overrun by the viet cong upon landing sergeant bennetts unit was confronted by enemy forces twice he refused extraction by military helicopters as he was concerned for the pilots safety and wanted to continue the fight against the enemy after a furious and courageous battle sergeant bennett was taken prisoner by the viet cong like so many of his colleagues he spent 179 days as a pow and attempted to escape three times at great risk his captors executed him on june 25 1965 only 24 years old sergeant bennett was the first american pow killed in vietnam and like so many other servicemen who lost their lives there his remains have never returned home"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a lot of this is talk and with due respect to my friend from colorado i hear the point but i would say a lot of that is we are hearing we we this we this we the

mr meehans bill is to provide restitution to american victims it is not just any american victims it is the victims of iranian terror 150 billion is going to flow to iran it seems to be common sense that the first 43 billion should instead be paid to the victims of iranian terror joseph cicippio was one of those victims he lived right outside my congressional district he spent 5 years in brutal captivity before being released in 1991 a vote for this bill today is a vote for the victims of iranian terror i also want to say congressman meehans congressional district is right next to mine i want to thank him for his thoughtful creative approach and his leadership in this country and in this house on this bill"]]}
