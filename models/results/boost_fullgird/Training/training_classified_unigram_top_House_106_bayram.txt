troops invaded south korea pouring across the 38th parallel and precipitating the korean war unprepared south korean or rok forces and the handful of americans on the ground were incapable of halting this swift and brutal assault in a matter of days the badly battered unitedstates and rok units had been pushed back to a tiny toehold on the southern tip of the korean peninsula it was only with determination and unbelievable courage that american forces together with south korean and allied troops were able to push back the attacking north korean army the breakout of the pusan perimeter the inchon landing battles like pork chop hill and heartbreak ridge the terrible fight against overwhelming odds at the frozen chosin reservoir on these and countless other unnamed battlefields we beat back the invaders the korean conflict reflected the absolute determination of the united states to halt the spread of tyranny and totalitarianism but the cost was high the war that north korea started resulted in 39 000 unitedstates deaths and over 100 000 wounded and severely undermined unitedstates relations with russia and china it took decades for our south korean ally to recover in the socalled democratic peoples republic of korea the dprk there is certainly a very different and distorted interpretation of the events that occurred 50 years ago incredibly according to the north korean news agency quote the unitedstates instigated the rok army to start a surprise armed invasion of north korea on june 25 1950 it was commanded by the unitedstates military advisory group end of quote the newscast goes on to explain that in precipitating this unprovoked attack the unitedstates supposedly indiscriminately carpet bombed throughout north korea these lies from north korea newscasts are not from some ancient historical record no this was the broadcast in the last several weeks it is worth noting that this slanderous pack of lies was broadcast right after the recent historic meeting between south korean president kim dae jung and north korean leader kim jong il it was broadcast the day after the united states had announced the delivery to north korea of an additional 50 000 tons of grain and about the same time that north korea was reinventing history secretary of state albright was announcing that north korea is not a terrorist state or even a rogue state but merely a state of concern this member points this out because of the recent changes in perception regarding north korea on the verge of collapse the hermit kingdom is at least attempting to give the impression that it is reaching out to south korea and to the west if north korea is in fact sincere in its peaceful overtures that certainly would be a dramatic positive development however it would be premature to assume that the dprk has irrevocably reformed its behavior it would be naive in the extreme to believe that a few gestures constitute a reversion of 50 years of violently confrontational behavior and terrorism and it would be foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary

trigger that was added in on the last round of amendments that were put in place we have had projections that are almost mindboggling when we look at the dollar amount of these surpluses we are projecting into the future if we do not count the social security surplus but just in our other accounts we have nearly 1 trillion worth of surplus projected now with that number being projected our tax cutters looked at it and said well we would like to give 80 to 90 percent of that back to the american public in the form of a tax cut i for one fully agree with giving back tax dollars that are that much in surplus to those needed to run our government functions however when it is done on a 10year forecast there is risk involved in how accurate that forecast may be and as i looked at that i said we need to do something to protect the tax cuts and at the same time ensure that we continue this path of paying down public debt in doing so we came to a triggering mechanism and the trigger works in the fashion that if we are not continuing to pay down the debt we will not take the tax cut that year it is a simple mechanism just how much interest are we paying on the debt if that number does not get smaller each year then we will pay more down on the debt and not have a tax cut that year the trigger mechanism is very important because it allows us to very responsibly manage the

by the gentleman from vermont to restrict the use of funds by the internal revenue service to take any action that would undermine the pension laws or age discrimination in employment act the intent of the amendment is to retaliate against companies converting defined benefit plans to cash balance plans ultimately the gentleman seeks to prohibit such conversions because they may be detrimental to the retirement benefits of longterm employees because defined benefit plans provide the greatest amount of value towards the end of the employees relationship with the company the effect of these conversions may fall more harshly on older longterm employees who have spent their entire careers with one employer i share the gentlemans concern about the impact of these conversions on longterm employees in fact the issue hits me personally as my wife is one of those employees in a defined benefit plan who is within a few years of retirement while i believe that we should consider how to change our pension laws to protect these employees this amendment does not accomplish that objective i also strongly disagree with my colleagues assessment that cash balance plans should be prohibited the amendment says that the internal revenue service cannot fund any action that violates relevant tax pension or age discrimination laws on its face the amendment is targeting the wrong party the amendment has to take this approach to be considered on the floor today it is a classic example of why legislation is not permitted on appropriations billsthey simply are too clumsy to be effective policysetting tools on a more technical level these laws say that accruedor earnedbenefits cannot be reduced on the basis of age however future accrual are not protected by these laws moreover while longterm employees may bear a greater burden they are not being singled out on the basis of age because the conversion affects everyone in the company for this reason there is genuine disagreement over whether the conversion violates age discrimination laws most observers assert that cash balance plans are not inherently flawed and in fact the problem is not with cash balance plans but how the transition from defined benefit to cash balance plan is implemented finally cash balance plans play an important role attracting workers in a period when labor markets are tight and the workforce increasingly mobile portability is not a characteristic that should be penalized in our zeal to protect older and or less mobile employees the solution must take a broader view of the conversion requiring employers to provide other benefits to longterm employees facing the prospect of having their future benefits cut this approach reflects the economic reality for most conversions while

precipitating the korean war unprepared south korean or rok forces and the handful of americans on the ground were incapable of halting this swift and brutal assault in a matter of days the badly battered unitedstates and rok units had been pushed back to a tiny toehold on the southern tip of the korean peninsula it was only with determination and unbelievable courage that american forces together with south korean and allied troops were able to push back the attacking north korean army the breakout of the pusan perimeter the inchon landing battles like pork chop hill and heartbreak ridge the terrible fight against overwhelming odds at the frozen chosin reservoir on these and countless other unnamed battlefields we beat back the invaders the korean conflict reflected the absolute determination of the united states to halt the spread of tyranny and totalitarianism but the cost was high the war that north korea started resulted in 39 000 unitedstates deaths and over 100 000 wounded and severely undermined unitedstates relations with russia and china it took decades for our south korean ally to recover in the socalled democratic peoples republic of korea the dprk there is certainly a very different and distorted interpretation of the events that occurred 50 years ago incredibly according to the north korean news agency quote the unitedstates instigated the rok army to start a surprise armed invasion of north korea on june 25 1950 it was commanded by the unitedstates military advisory group end of quote the newscast goes on to explain that in precipitating this unprovoked attack the unitedstates supposedly indiscriminately carpet bombed throughout north korea these lies from north korea newscasts are not from some ancient historical record no this was the broadcast in the last several weeks it is worth noting that this slanderous pack of lies was broadcast right after the recent historic meeting between south korean president kim dae jung and north korean leader kim jong il it was broadcast the day after the united states had announced the delivery to north korea of an additional 50 000 tons of grain and about the same time that north korea was reinventing history secretary of state albright was announcing that north korea is not a terrorist state or even a rogue state but merely a state of concern this member points this out because of the recent changes in perception regarding north korea on the verge of collapse the hermit kingdom is at least attempting to give the impression that it is reaching out to south korea and to the west if north korea is in fact sincere in its peaceful overtures that certainly would be a dramatic positive development however it would be premature to assume that the dprk has irrevocably reformed its behavior it would be naive in the extreme to believe that a few gestures constitute a reversion of 50 years of violently confrontational behavior and terrorism and it would be foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary he must continue to view north korea as a terrorist state and to regard the korean
