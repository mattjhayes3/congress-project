few years the reasons are really pretty simple first we are trying to do way too much for other countries we have spent 300 billion in the last 3 years in iraq and afghanistan probably over half of it is just pure foreign aid we have every department and agency in the federal government doing operations overseas spending several hundred billion a year over there the liberal stand out here is that foreign aid was not popular so they will very possibly tell you that foreign aid is only 12 percent of the budget when we add up what all the departments and agencies are doing it is just phenomenal how much we are spending in other countries i heard a news report recently that said the fbi has more offices in other countries than we have in the unitedstates secondly we have promised too much here at home in retirement and medical benefits thirdly we will not reduce defense or homeland security spending even though there is waste in those departments just like all the other departments and there just simply is not enough money to pay for all of it on january 26 of this year the congressional budget office said the federal deficit for this fiscal year which ends september 30 will be around 360 billion some people say it will be much higher than that and similar amounts 350 billion to 400 billion for each of the next 10 or 11 years all of this comes on top of the national debt that is already 8 3 trillion and headed up very quickly our government in just a few years will not be able to pay all of the military pensions the civil service pensions the social security the medicare the medicaid and the new prescription drug benefit we have guaranteed 44 million private pensions through the pension benefit guaranty corporation we will just not be able to pay all those things with money that means anything but what we will do we will do what governments all over the world have done in similar situations and we will simply begin printing more money this will cause social security and all those government and private pension plans to buy less each year it doesnt work it is like a ball headed downhill its starts out slow and gathers speed when this money supply gimmick does not do enough pensions will have to be cut anyone who is relying just on social security for his or her retirement will face tremendous financial hardship all of this could be avoided if the congress would become much more fiscally conservative and do it now however because there are too many liberal big spenders in the congress aind because it is unpopular to say no to anyone the congress could not even late last year pass a 50 billion slowdown in spending spreadover the next 5 years the overall reduction was reduced to 39 5 billion with the bulk of the reductions put off until the fourth and fifth years the plan that was passed did not cut spending it simply slowed the rate of growth barely but of course even that very meager effort at fiscal restraint could be changed by the next congress now let me go to a totally different topic mr speaker another concern at the end of 1994 the conservative business magazine forbes carried a lengthy article about the justice department it said we had quadrupled the justice department since 1980 and that federal prosecutors were falling all over themselves trying to find cases to prosecute the article said people were being prosecuted for laws they didnt even know were in existence and then the congress trying to prove it was tough on crime has expanded the department of justice greatly since then in addition to all this expansion we then passed a socalled patriot act to try to show strong opposition to terrorism this was such a great expansion of government power and such an overreach that now approximately 400 cities and counties and seven state legislatures have passed resolutions against this act those who love big government love the patriot act the federal government through the supersecret national security agency in addition to the cia fbi and about 12 other intelligence agencies has more than enough power and ways and means to discover and prosecute terrorists the foreign intelligence surveillance act court created in 1978 approveal 18 742 warrants for wiretapping and physical surveillance by the end of 2004 in the 5 years from 2000 to 2004 the court received 6 650 requests from the government and approved 6 642 we will probably hav e another terrorist incident of some sort with or without the patriot act we need to take reasonable precautions but we also need to recognize that you are still hundreds of times more likely to be struck by lightning or to win a lottery than you are to be killed by a terrorist those in charge of all the many government programs which have sprung up to fight terrorism do not like to admit this because they want continual increases in funding but we should not create some kind of a federal police state in a huge overreaction

recognize his tremendous status both as a buddhist leader and international advocate for peace i must object to the manner in which this body chooses to honor him i wonder if my colleagues see the irony in honoring a devout buddhist monk with a material gift of gold the buddhist tradition of course eschews worldly possessions in favor of purity of thought and action buddhism urges its practitioners to alleviate the suffering of others whenever possible im sure his holiness the dalai lama would rather see 30 000 spent to help those less fortunate rather than for a feelgood congressional gesture we cannot forget that congress has no authority under the constitution to spend taxpayer money on medals and awards no matter how richly deserved and i reiterate my offer of 100 from my own pocket to pay for this medal if members wish to honor the dalai lama all we need to do is pay for it ourselves if all 435 of us contribute the cost will be roughly 70 each so while a gold medal sounds like a great idea it becomes a bit strange when we see the actual cost involved if congress truly wishes to honor the dalai lama it could instead start by showing more respect for his views in the areas of foreign policy war and terrorism the bellicosity often demonstrated on the floor of this institution toward entire nations and their people conflicts sharply with the peaceful teachings of the dalai lama consider the following words of his holiness when september 11 happened the next day i wrote a letter to president bush as a friendbecause i know him personally i wrote this letter and expressed besides my condolences and sadness a countermeasure to this tragedy a nonviolent response because that would have been more effective so this is my stance and then just before the iraq crisis started millions of people from countries like australia and america expressed their opposition to violence i really admired and appreciated this when the war started some people immediately asked me if it was justified or not whether it was right or wrong in principle any resort to violence is wrong consider also these thoughts from the dalai lama regarding the terrible pointlessness of war we have seen that we cannot solve human problems by fighting problems resulting from differences in opinion must be resolved through the gradual process of dialogue undoubtedly wars produce victors and losers but only temporarily victory or defeat resulting from wars cannot be longlasting secondly our world has become so interdependent that the defeat of one country must impact the rest of the world or cause all of us to suffer losses either directly or indirectly today the world is so small and so interdependent that the concept of war has become anachronistic an outmoded approach as a rule we always talk about reform and changes among the old traditions there are many aspects that are either illsuited to our present reality or are

they were stunned to know about the difference in prices everybody thinks that oil and natural gas is a world price and i have to explain that to most people when i explain this issue in my district i just do not have people opposed to the production of natural gas on the outer continental shelf because they know that we desperately need it to heat our homes to run our businesses and to make products it is such an integral part and it is the clean fuel as i said it is almost the perfect fuel if we could produce enough natural gas that the price was more affordable maybe a little less than gasoline and fuel oil costs it could be the bridge to the future it could relieve the need for building more refineries which will take years it can relieve our need to increase our dependence on foreign oil from unstable parts of the world now there are those who think liquefied natural gas is the way to go and i do not really want to get into that discussion tonight i think it can be helpful but many are pinpointing our whole future that means we build the most expensive ships we build very controversial ports to bring the gas back because you chill it you put it in ships bring it back here regasify it and put it in these ports and many people look at those in a very negative fashion plus it is very costly but i am even more concerned about where we get it we get it from countries like algeria nigeria libya and russia do we want to be further energy dependent on third world countries that are unfriendly with unstable governments when we have such an ample supply here there are many who feel that the outer continental shelf has more than twice as much gas as the gentleman mentioned 400 trillion cubic feet but one of the reasons we do not know is we have not really measured it the law has prevented us from having modern seismographic measurements of what is on the outer continental shelf for either gas or oil i want to share something i have here osram sylvania has three plants in my district and 14 plants in the northeast and here is what they said in a letter that i received from them dated october 26 in the past 5 years we have seen natural gas prices escalate from 3 per mcf to well over 10 on the spot market as compared to natural gas costs in 2000 our bills in 2005 will be 24 million higher in fact for 2004 to 2005 alone gas costs for us have escalated by 7 million this is the single largest rate of increase in any of our costs of production at current supply levels we expect to see gas prices exceed 12 per mcf in 06 and 07 i think that will happen tliis winter not next winter which will add another 7 million to our energy bills accordingly since 2000 the rate of annual increase will exceed 25 percent that means their cost of gas went up 25 percent a year here is the important part furthermore while the vast majority of our production is based in the united states that means they are making their products and part of these are light bulbs they are all almost all made in the united states nearly 60 percent of our competitors products are manufactured outside of the united states some in europe where natural gas costs are less than 5 per mcf and asia particularly china where gas is less than 4 per mcf by 2007 competitive disadvantage will be over 20 million on top of the wage gap versus china which is already overwhelming we are deeply concerned that if natural gas prices continue to skyrocket our competitiveness will erode having unhappy consequences for a unitedstates based manufacturing strategy while some people may argue that passing the cost on to consumers is the remedy price increases in the lamp market with so many global competitors it is an impossibility price increases to consumers to cover natural gas cost increases should be unnecessary as long as a timely viable natural gas strategy is implemented globally competitive energy costs especially natural gas are a necessity to maintain our financial vitality and keep good paying and suitable jobs in the united states we agree with you that coastal offshore drilling for new natural gas supplies carried out in a responsible and expeditious manner

and afghanistan probably over half of it is just pure foreign aid we have every department and agency in the federal government doing operations overseas spending several hundred billion a year over there the liberal stand out here is that foreign aid was not popular so they will very possibly tell you that foreign aid is only 12 percent of the budget when we add up what all the departments and agencies are doing it is just phenomenal how much we are spending in other countries i heard a news report recently that said the fbi has more offices in other countries than we have in the unitedstates secondly we have promised too much here at home in retirement and medical benefits thirdly we will not reduce defense or homeland security spending even though there is waste in those departments just like all the other departments and there just simply is not enough money to pay for all of it on january 26 of this year the congressional budget office said the federal deficit for this fiscal year which ends september 30 will be around 360 billion some people say it will be much higher than that and similar amounts 350 billion to 400 billion for each of the next 10 or 11 years all of this comes on top of the national debt that is already 8 3 trillion and headed up very quickly our government in just a few years will not be able to pay all of the military pensions the civil service pensions the social security the medicare the medicaid and the new prescription drug benefit we have guaranteed 44 million private pensions through the pension benefit guaranty corporation we will just not be able to pay all those things with money that means anything but what we will do we will do what governments all over the world have done in similar situations and we will simply begin printing more money this will cause social security and all those government and private pension plans to buy less each year it doesnt work it is like a ball headed downhill its starts out slow and gathers speed when this money supply gimmick does not do enough pensions will have to be cut anyone who is relying just on social security for his or her retirement will face tremendous financial hardship all of this could be avoided if the congress would become much more fiscally conservative and do it now however because there are too many liberal big spenders in the congress aind because it is unpopular to say no to anyone the congress could not even late last year pass a 50 billion slowdown in spending spreadover the next 5 years the overall reduction was reduced to 39 5 billion with the bulk of the reductions put off until the fourth and fifth years the plan that was passed did not cut spending it simply slowed the rate of growth barely but of course even that very meager effort at fiscal restraint could be changed by the next congress now let me go to a totally different topic mr speaker another concern at the end of 1994 the conservative business magazine forbes carried a lengthy article about the justice department it said we had quadrupled the justice department since 1980 and that federal prosecutors were falling all over themselves trying to find cases to prosecute the article said people were being prosecuted for laws they didnt even know were in existence and then the congress trying to prove it was tough on crime has expanded the department of justice greatly since then in addition to all this expansion we then passed a socalled patriot act to try to show strong opposition to terrorism this was such a great expansion of government power and such an overreach that now approximately 400 cities and counties and seven state legislatures have passed resolutions against this act those who love big government love the patriot act the federal government through the supersecret national security agency in addition to the cia fbi and about 12 other intelligence agencies has more than enough power and ways and means to discover and prosecute terrorists

iraqi people feeling despondent for their future let me be clear the litmus test for whether or troops should stay or withdraw or on what timetable is not about nationbuilding the unitedstates should not be in the business of nationbuilding now or ever there is nothing in the constitution which grants this congress the authority to engage in nationbuilding nor does the american public wish that we do so instead the nation which we must always remain steadfast engaged in protecting and building up is this nationamerica the future of the iraqi people is in their hands and left to their imagination but the truth of the matter is that life for the iraqi peopledespite the ongoing war on their soil has been more hopeful than it was before wasting away in the shackles of saddam husseins tyranny and it is only getting better for those iraqis who survived saddams policies of genocide political imprisonment and nearconstant state of war they went without jobs food and medicine all the while saddam and his cronies pocketed billions in illicit oil profits and grew fat from oilforfood program kickbacks the iraqis have had increasingly broad and successful elections they have developed a constitution and established a government just last week the iraqis appointed key ministers for defense national security and interior now that the iraqi people are free to direct their own economy their own policies and their own destiny there is hope for a brighter future just last year in 2005 the iraqi economy grow by 3 percent this year economists predict that the economy will grow by 10 percent with a7 gdp that will have almost doubled since the fall of saddam hussein as freely elected economic officials begin to work for the benefit of all iraqis the future of the iraqi economy is bright the iraqi people are rebuilding their capability to care for their own medical needs last year 98 percent of children under the age of three were vaccinated against measles mumps and rubella basic care has been provided for 1 5 million new mothers and their children ensuring that a new generation of iraqis will grow up strong and healthy over 110 medical facilities have been renovated and 600 centers have been equipped with basic clinical and lab equipment by providing training for 2 500 health care workers iraqis will build a structure for living longer healthier lives far into the future iraq once boasted one of the most educated female populations in the middle east under saddam husseins iron fist they fell to near perfect illiteracy working together we have helped the iraqis provide for 2 800 rehabilitated schools and 8 7 million math and science textbooks and young girls can look forward to careers as engineers and scientists instead of looking forward to legalized honor killings the preamble of the iraqi constitution reads we the people of iraq are determined to respect the rule of law reject the policy of aggression pay attention to women and their rights the elderly and their cares the children and their affairs spread the culture of diversity and defuse terrorism this is a statement rarely seen in the history of middle eastern nations iraqi legislators are determined to create a free society on par with our own the future of iraq is one in which men and women are free to practice their religion and speak their mind without fear of imprisonment or death every one of us feels for the parents and loved ones of the brave men and women who are serving in iraq every one of us wants to see those young heroes quickly and safely return home i would like to read from a message i received from one of those brave young men who is serving in iraq he said there is a tough war going on here but we can either fight the enemy here or back at home if we were to withdraw there would be a bloodbath of epic proportions that would only encourage the enemies of civilization now is the time that the iraqi people may build a bright future of freedom opportunity and peace upon their rich cultural heritage"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a reporter from a major news organization in the united states who is now stationed in iraq made the statement the other day that if he wrote a single story that was positive about what was going on in iraq he would have to fight with his editor to get it published is it any wonder that we have such a negative attitude in america about the war and the way it is going i think it is time for a little reality during the last week of november 526 insurgents were detained or killed and 104 weapons caches were discovered during 355 combined operations and in those operations 30 percent of them were conducted independently by iraqi security forces as of november 16 2005 a total of 211 700 iraqi security forces have been trained andequipped the number includes 99 500 ministry of defense forces and 112 200 ministry of interior forces thirty iraqi army battalions have assumed primary control of their own areas and on and on it goes there is a lot of good news out of iraq and we ought to begin to listen to it"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a selfclaimed sadistic pervert jerry inman is branded with tattoos of skulls daggers

therapy or counseling because some are just evil and if we do not lock them up indefinitely then it seems that outlaws like inman are wasting good air breathing and thats just the way it is"], [0.5,

the great differentiations between hezbollah and israel while desperately trying to retrieve two of her soldiers who were abducted by hezbollah terrorists israel takes great lengths to minimize civilian casualties conversely hezbollah takes great lengths to maximize civilian casualties in israel while making breathing barricades out of the innocent men women and children in lebanon time and again israel has made efforts for peace israel fully withdrew from lebanon then she uprooted from gaza she was thanked with rockets mayhem and bloodbath the recent kidnapping and murder of israeli citizens and soldiers were definitive acts of war hezbollah terrorists along with the nations of syria and iran who support them are the aggressors and now as israel has risen up to defend herself along with each of the individual citizens whom she loves we hear cries from the u n and other quarters for israel to restrain herself what if on 9 11 the outcry was for the united states to restrain ourselves or what if israel had listened to such calls for restraint 15 years ago when she learned that saddam hussein was building a nuclear reactor the united states and our coalition forces would have faced terrorists with nuclear weapons when we lifted the iron hand of saddam hussein in 2003 you see israel under7 stands that the entire world faces an evil poisonous ideology that causes mothers to leap for joy when their children blow themselves to pieces in order to kill other innocent human beings israel understands that a dark ideology like that must never be allowed to gain nuclear weapons and why does the rest of the world not seem to understand that this is the same ideology that murdered olympic athletes in 1972 that took american hostages in iran that murdered marines in their barracks in 1993 that bombed the world trade center in 1993 riyadh in 1995 the khobar towers in 1996 the embassy in 1998 and the uss cole in 2000 and then this murderess ideology massacred nearly 3 000 americans on september 11 and today this is the same ideology that is launching rockets into israel to kill innocent civilians and lest we forget it is the same ideology that is working feverishly to gain nuclear weapons to terrorize the western world in ways that we cannot yet imagine seven decades ago another murderess ideology arose in the world the dark shadow of the swastika fell first upon the jewish people of germany and because the world did not respond to such an evil it began to spread across europe until it lit the fires of world war iis hell on earth which saw atomic bombs fall on cities and over 50 million people dead worldwide all because the worlds free people did not respond in time 0l 2245 history has taught us that evil ideologies must ultimately be defeated in the minds of human beings but in the meantime in the meantime they must often be defeated upon the battlefield the battle israel fights in these days is a battle to protect all of humanity from an evil ideology that has no respect for innocent human life anywhere on the earth that is why israels war is our war and if there is hope for peace and freedom in this world free peoples across this world just unite to defeat this hellish ideology of terrorism this time we must not wait too long so may the people of israel take comfort in these days knowing that america stands with you may you find victory and may the light of gods peace shine down upon the streets of jerusalem forever"]]}
