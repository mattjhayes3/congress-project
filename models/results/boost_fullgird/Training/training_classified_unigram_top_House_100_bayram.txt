extended support at times when indeed we should have been pressuring for change that did not come through democratic and republican administrations over too many years in my first session in 1979 that

has never seen 1 hours worth of hearings in nor any examination by the cor mittees of the congress who have developed the expertise in drafting health care legislation and in providing secure funding for it no one knows if the bill before us is financially sound i wouldnt oppose a bill on an important subject like this on merely procedural grounds but there is good reason for a sound process and this bill coming as it does directly to the floor from the pen of the sponsor without any intervening examination has bypassed every opportunity this institution provides to be sure that legislation

benefitsonly to find that it increased them too much we could not afford to pay benefits that generous without breaking the social security system so congress went back and tried to correct its mistake and presto the notch years were created in short congress was trying to do a good thing but it did not take the time to do it right we are about to do that all over again there is legislation in the senate to address the need for home health care there is legis lation being developed in the house to deal with this very same issue they are proceed ing through the regular process and they will come before this bodywith a track record of analysis that can demonstrate that it will be workable we should let those efforts proceed but trying to rush a measurehowever well meaningthat has

care only to have to dash the hopes when we discover that the program was not well thought out or properly financed that turns hope to despair fortunately our choice is not between passing this bill

district shut its doors there was no notice given to the workers i was angry i thought the actions of the ownership of that plant were despicable and i thought what congress should do is pass legislation that requires that notice be given to the workers then somewhere in the back of my mind i heard the voice of an old priest that used to rattle around the halls of i oras college in dubuque ia he said the road to hell is paved with good intentions i cannot mimic him very well but the fact of life is that in this case the road to hell is paved with good intentions we all want to help workers and some think that by passing this legislation we will but i suggest to my colleagues the opposite is true the fact is that when layoffs occur they usually occur because of a lost customer or they occur because of commodity price changes let us say the price of corn has gone up and the ethanol plant no longer has a market or maybe there is a new competitor the sponsors of the legislation say those are unforeseeable and we are not going to have a problem with that but the fact of life is that if notice is not given by those employers they are going to be in a position where they face litigation so the bottom line is that this bill prohibits a private employer from imposing a necessary partial layoff in order to save jobs for other workers and that is what is wrong with the legislation at its most basic but there is another thing that is wrong with it besides the fact that it costs jobs and that is that it is directed toward small businesses the large employers are already covered most of them by collectivebargaining contracts and the rest of them ladies and gentlemen will thumb their noses at this legislation look at what happens in canada the large companies every other week put in their paycheck a notice which says in 30 days or 60 days we will be closing down and it occurs week after week after wcek and they get around the bill but the smaller businesses are not sophisticated enough to do that so it provides no protection from the large but it hurts the small so i suggest to my colleagues if they want more plant closings vote for this bill

led by the korea feed association president park chanyung has very recently been visiting various cities in the united states to announce purchases of several million bushels of united states grain last tuesday the delegation visited lincoln ne as it visited other american cities and yesterday it was in washington dc as a member of congress who represents a large and important agricultural constituency i certainly appreciate their purchase of american grain however as this korean buying mission tours the united states and with great fanfare announcing purchases of grain i wish they would also explain why they have such a terrible protectionist policy affecting many other united states agricultural commodities and processed food productsfor example their barriers against the import of beef while i try not be cynical about the korean purchases i can only conclude that one reason for the high profile given thcse grain purchases is an attempt to hide their protectionist import policies toward a variety of agricultural and food products the worst example is their virtually total ban on highquality unitedstates beef which has been in effect since may 1985 in light of the korean trade surplus with the united states of 7 3 billion in 1986a 72 percent increase in 1 year over 1985we deserve better treatment and more access to korean markets open united states markets and the international trading system have worked well for korea and koreans havw benefited enormously korea is now the 10th largest trading nation in the world and its 1987 exports of 47 billion exceeded the total gnp of many other countries in the world currently the united states is by far its largest trading partner and korea is the seventh largest trading partner of the united states in recent years korean exports to the united states rose dramatically increasing at an average 20percent annual rate today approximately 40 percent of all korean exports go to the united statesthats right an incredible 40 percent of their total export market is found in our country koreas recent feed grain buying spree in the united states is surely designed in significant part to mute criticism of the fact that the united states share of the korean agricultural market had fallen to its lowest point in almost 20 years in regard to agricultural trade korea exported more than 41 million worth of processed foods and beverages to the united states this represents a doubling of sales over the past 5 years in contrast united states food and beverage sales to korea slipped from 19 million in 1982 to 18 million in 1986 in response to trade policy measu es designed to keep highvalue agricultural product imports to a minimum while promoting their exports there are small amounts of trade in the international interest but the trends are unfortunately significant we know however that a market exists in korea for united states food products by the fact that so much of it is being illegally sold out of a united states military post and base exchanges most of the discussion regarding united states beef exports has been focused on the expiration of the united statesjapanese agreement on their beef quotas however koreas outright ban on imported beef should be the initial focus of american policymakers and american people is it fair absolutely not and every american will recognize that when they know about the ban its outrageous in january 1987 we reached an understanding with the korean government that the united states would not file a gatt case against korea on beef in exchange for the korean govermnnts commitment to inprove access for other agricultuial products and a resumption of beef imports by the end of 1987 the government of korea has reneged theyve broken their promise to the cou try that is the destination of 40 percent of their total exports theyve broken their promise to the nation that ensures their security against north korea aggression the 1987 deadline has now passed and the market remains closedslammed shut this issue has been the subject of intense and protracted negotiations so far little progress has been made with no results the outcome of these discussions on removing the ban and the quota on beef will be a test of koreas commitment to open its markets resolving the agricultural trade issues will reassure skeptics in the american public and congress that the administration can ensure and the korean government will at long last really provide fair market access for american goods and services it is a test of whether the government of korea will keep its commitments if the administration cant demonstrate convincingly that market access can be achieved in countries which have very large trade surpluses with the united states the concerns of many americans about unfair trade practices among our international trading partners will grow and there will be that much less likelihood of removing the more extreme protectionst trade provisions from the omnibus trade bill which is currently in conference at this time a quite appropriate section 301 case regarding koreas treatment of the united states beef has been filed with the office of the united states special trade representative independently the ustp raised the issue lt a gatt dispute panel last week in geneva switzerland while the united states was assured or placated last year that some liberalization would occur once the korean presidential elections were concluded nothing substantive has been forthcoming from the koreans we are now being told that no action may be taken prior to the upcoming parliamentary elections in korea because united states beef exports would be a sensitive political issue quite frankly a total ban on united states beef is a sensitive issue here too i would remind the korean government that we have been patient too long what will be the next excuse for inaction that is offered it is time to set these political excuses aside unitedstates cattle producers have had enough the time for stonewalling and excuses is over i would encourage the ustr to accept the 301 case which it has pending and to proceed full speed in prosecuting the case korea is no longer an impoverished country it now has a responsibility to play fairly in the world trading environment which has enabled it to prosper in light of our huge trade deficit with korea it is not unreasonable to have open access to the korean market the elimination of koreas restrictions on united states beef would be an excellent start if protecting korean beef producers is politically sensitive they can do the same thing that the japanese should dodirectly subsidize their beef producers they can pay them and permit the korean and japanese consumers to reap the advantages of more highquality beef at much much lower prices again thank you korea for purchasing our grain but please be fair and live up to your promises to remove the beef ban as the first step in an immediate action to begin a speedy phaseout of beef quotas we appreciate your grain and soybean business but given your huge trade surplus with us we can and do expect to

this amendment that is proposed or the position that is proposed by the gentleman from california mr dannemeyeri will accomplish nothing and the reason for that is very simple georgetown and the district of columbia have reached an agreement in resolution of their dispute georgetown is quite happy with that agreement they have written all and sundry who have inquired about it stating that the entire georgetown community faculty administrators students alumni all are happy with the agreement and that regardless of what congress does as to the armstrong amendment georgetown will not change the stance it now has which it considers educationally sound that position as this bill moves along will be offered by the gentleman from california who will exert his right under our rules after we

what basis at all is there for us to be trying to legislate with respect to the district of columbia i would finally like to appeal to my colleagues simply on the basis of protecting the prerogatives of the house of representatives the fact of the matter is that an amendment of the kind we are being asked to recede to here cannot be passed during ordinary house consideration of an appropriation bill because it permits an appropriation to take effect only if someone else takes some nonministerials act and that kind of an amendment has consistently been ruled out of order as legislating on an appropriation bill if we are going to accept these kinds of amendments when they are offered on the senate side where the senate binds itself by no such rule then we are continually going to be putting ourselves at a disadvantage with respect to the senate today it is only the district of columbia authorizing committee that is hurt by the action and i know members around here unlesss they come from the metrop~olitan area do not pay a lot of attention to the workings of that committee but i say to every other member of the house on every other authorizing committee maybe it is the district of columbia committee this time whose ox is being gored but the same can be done in the way of legislation on appropriation bills in the senate on any other appropriation bill that comes through if you are going to start the practice of giving away to this kind of activity on the part of the senate time after time on this bill you know they will start using other appropriation bills to take advantage of our authorizing committees just the same way they are taking advantage of the district of columbia committee here it is time for us in the house to insist on our prerogatives to

minister nakasone of japan the presidents personal involvement can be a deciding factor in inducing a foreign government to accommodate our concerns second the bill transfers substantial authority from the president to the unitedstates trade representative in my view the president is in the best position to decide trade policy issues based on our national interests with regard to foreign relations national security foreign and domestic economic considerations similarly i am concerned that national security interests will not be given sufficient consideration as the commerce department is asked to reduce by 40 percent the control list which prohibits the unlicensed export of items which could make a significant contribution to the military capability of the warsaw pact countries third the bill makes several important changes in unfair trade practices under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 as the california world trade commission has pointed out it is inappropriate to include export targeting as an unfair trade practice because of the absence of a generally accepted definition we would undermine the credibility of our trade laws by including internationally accepted conduct while inviting retaliation and mirror legislation to the serious detriment of unitedstates exporters with regard to international worker rights i dont see how we can penalize other countries for violating conventions which the united states has never accepted finally the bill provides for mandatory retaliation by the unitedstates trade representative if a foreign country has violated a trade agreement or engaged in unjustifiable practices this statutory hairtrigger will encourage automatic retaliation not the open markets which would benefit unitedstates exporters the gephardt amendment would take this protectionist approach one step further it would mandate a 10 percent reduction in the trade surplus of a country which has an excessive trade surplus this amendment is nothing less than an invitation to a trade war it brings to mind the disastrous effects of the smoothawley tariff act in the 1930s which led to spiraling retaliatory trade measures a sharp decline in world trade a decrease of almost 70 percent in unitedstates exports and the worst depression in the history of this country there are serious deficiencies in the international trading system but mandatory retaliation is not the answer if we want to improve our trade deficit the first thing we should do it confront our national debt which is over 2 trillion this year is the beginning of the 8th round of multilateral trade talks to be held under the auspices of the gatt these talks represent an important opportunity to improve the gatt framework for international trade we need to expand this framework to include services agriculuture direct foreign investment and intellectual property rights we need to strengthen and streamline the gatt dispute settlement procedures which are time consuming and fail to provide definitive enforceable decisions we cannot unilaterally solve our trade problems by amending our trade laws which are basically sound we must look to negotiations with our trading partners such as the current gatt talks to address the subsidies the tariffs and the market barriers which impede free trade and economic prosperity"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "when i was in

supported that violence this is witness for peace who did not like the idea of violence witness for peace said they supported the violence in the overthrow of the somoza regime what was ironic was

battlefield park which is located in virginias seventh district which i am privileged to represent the issue of how to protect the manassas national battlefield park is very complicated and there are many aspects to this issue the manassas battlefield park is located in prince william county va which is one of the fastest growing counties in the nation therefore the park is inevitably confronted by developments which have the potential to diminish the integrity of this battlefield which was the site of the first and second battles of manassas during the civil war in addition the park service has stated that the traffic running through the park represents a grave threat to the manassas battlefield park with or without the proposed william center or any other new development in the area the department of the interior estimated that traffic volume on route 234 which runs northsouth through the park will increase by 150 percent in the near future route 29 which is a major eastwest commuter road running through the park is expected to see an increase in traffic by almost 60 percent in the next 20 years finally while the traffic threat to the park is real and critical so are the transportation needs of prince wil11am county therefore it would be a disservice to the citizens of this county to simply consider how we can better protect the park without also thinking about how such additional protections will affect the already severe transportation problems in this area for example while closing route 29 through the park would be of great initial benefit to the park such a change would be to the detriment of the countyand would therefore have a longterm negative effect on the park itselfwithout a simultaneous widening of interstate 66 to carry the resulting increase in eastwest traffic any consideration of legislation to protect the manassas national battlefield park therefore should take into account all of the factors which have an impact on the park the county and the citizens of prince william county i support and am a cosponsor of h r 4526 because it makes the decisions that are necessary for the congress to make if the william center tract of land is to be incorporated into the park first this legislation provides for a legislative taking of this tract of land allowing the federal government to immediately take title of the property upon enactment of this bill into law by congress and the president the value of the taken property will then be paid to its owners by the federal government this portion of this legislation is crucial because acquisition of the land would be both prompt and thorough rather than going through the authorization and appropriations process which could result in delays of up to 10 years and cost millions of dollars h r 4526 further provides immediate authorization of up to 30 million in federal funds but not more than 75 percent of total costs to conduct a study of the traffic problems in and around the park and to begin construction of the improvements recommended by the study this study will examine the possible closing of routes 234 and 29 within the park as well as the transportation improvements needed to effect such closings including the construction of additional lanes on interstate 66 a new 234 bypass and an interchange between 166 and the 234 bypass the secretary of the interior the virginia department of transportation the federal highway administration and the prince william county government will participate in conducting this study and recommendations will be reported to the congress within 1 year this legislationby including provisions which promptly deal with the needs of the park the county and the citizens of the countyrecognizes the valuable heritage the manassas

voice of an old priest that used to rattle around the halls of i oras college in dubuque ia he said the road to hell is paved with good intentions i cannot mimic him very well but the fact of life is that in this case the road to hell is paved with good intentions we all want to help workers and some think that by passing this legislation we will but i suggest to my colleagues the opposite is true

longer has a market or maybe there is a new competitor the sponsors of the legislation say those are unforeseeable and we are not going to have a problem with that but the fact of life is that if notice is not given by those employers they are going to be in a position where they face litigation so the bottom line is that this bill prohibits a private employer from imposing a necessary partial layoff in order to save jobs for other workers and that is what is wrong with the legislation at its most basic but there is another thing that is wrong with it besides the fact that it costs jobs and that is that it is directed toward small businesses the large employers are already covered most of them by collectivebargaining contracts and the rest of them ladies and gentlemen will thumb their

that has fueled a remarkable economic contemplate major policy changes expansion congress will be looking for the uptoday the republic of korea has an coming negotiations to strengthen an average income of 2 000 and is one of economic partnership that will benefit both the american and the korean people it is my hope the comments made tonight will send a message that even though congress is currently busy with an omnibus bill focusing on the big picture in trade we have certainly not lost sight of the smaller picture of our bilateral trade relationship with korea in all of this effort that the koreans have put forward to enhance their economy it is as i have mentioned a remarkable story in 1985 korea was our eighth largest export market purchasing 3 percent of our total exports in contrast that same year the united states was koreas no 1 export market buying 36 percent of koreas total exports the united stateskorea trade deficit though has been growing rapidly over the past few years the 1981 deficit of 200 million grew to over 4 billion by 1986 that is why i stand before this house tonight to talk about korea and the problems that loom ahead korea is not japan i repeat that they have shown a very goodfaith attempt to address many of the complaints that i have mentioned this evening and we applaud those attempts but must note that they do not address all united states concerns and in some cases are too slow to benefit either our producers or koreas economic vulnerability in 1983 the korean national assembly passed a 5year tariff reform package to cut general tariff rates down to industrial nations level by 1988 last year korea agreed to permit foreign companies to write life and other types of insurance policies in 1986 korea did not impose an additional 40to 60percent adjustment tariffs over and above general tariffs as it has done in the past korea recently completed a buying mission to the united states purchasing some 2 billion dollars worth of products in over 20 states now the korean government plans to open the entire color television market late in several weeks ago i announced that i was going to hold this special order this evening just today in the mail from the korean embassy the first time we have had mail from the korean embassy on this particular issue we get this announcement korea announces additional tariff restriction packages and this is datelined seoul april 6 the korean government announces today a sweeping tariff reduction package to further cut the duty on a range of agricultural and manufactured goods these effective july 1 1987 will affect 83 items in addition to those listed in the previously announced trade liberalization and tariff reduction schedule i will read those this evening because i think they are significant"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a feed grain buying mission led by the korea feed association president park chanyung has very recently been visiting various cities in the united states to announce purchases of several million bushels of united states grain last tuesday the delegation visited lincoln ne as it visited other american cities and yesterday it was in washington dc as a member of congress who represents a large and important agricultural constituency i certainly appreciate their purchase of american grain however as this korean buying mission tours the united states and with great fanfare announcing purchases of grain i wish they would also explain why they have such a terrible protectionist policy affecting many other united states agricultural commodities and processed food productsfor example their barriers against the import of beef while i try not be cynical about the korean purchases i can only conclude that one reason for the high profile given thcse grain purchases is an attempt to hide their protectionist import policies toward a variety of agricultural and food products the worst example is their virtually total ban on highquality unitedstates beef which has been in effect since may 1985 in light of the korean trade surplus with the united states of 7 3 billion in 1986a 72 percent increase in 1 year over 1985we deserve better treatment and more access to korean markets open united states markets and the international trading system have worked well for korea and koreans havw benefited enormously korea is now the 10th largest trading nation in the world and its 1987 exports of 47 billion exceeded the total gnp of many other countries in the world currently the united states is by far its largest trading partner and korea is the seventh largest trading partner of the united states in recent years korean exports to the united states rose dramatically increasing at an average 20percent annual rate today approximately 40 percent of all korean exports go to the united statesthats right an incredible 40 percent of their total export market is found in our country koreas recent feed grain buying spree in the united states is surely designed in significant part to mute criticism of the fact that the united states share of the korean agricultural market had fallen to its lowest point in almost 20 years in regard to agricultural trade korea exported more than 41 million worth of processed foods and beverages to the united states this represents a doubling of sales over the past 5 years in contrast united states food and beverage sales to korea slipped from 19 million in 1982 to 18 million in 1986 in response to trade policy measu es designed to keep highvalue agricultural product imports to a minimum while promoting their exports there are small amounts of trade in the international interest but the trends are unfortunately significant we know however that a market exists in korea for united states food products by the fact that so much of it is being illegally sold out of a united states military post and base exchanges most of the discussion regarding united states beef exports has been focused on the expiration of the united statesjapanese agreement on their beef quotas however koreas outright ban on imported beef should be the initial focus of american policymakers and american people is it fair absolutely not and every american will recognize that when they know about the ban its outrageous in january 1987 we reached an understanding with the korean government that the united states would not file a gatt case against korea on beef in exchange for the korean govermnnts commitment to inprove access for other agricultuial products and a resumption of beef imports by the end of 1987 the government of korea has reneged theyve broken their promise to the cou try that is the destination of 40 percent of their total exports theyve broken their promise to the nation that ensures their security against north korea aggression the 1987 deadline has now passed and the market remains closedslammed shut this issue has been the subject of intense and protracted negotiations so far little progress has been made with no results the outcome of these discussions on removing the ban and the quota on beef will be a test of koreas commitment to open its markets resolving the agricultural trade issues will reassure skeptics in the american public and congress that the administration can ensure and the korean government will at long last really provide fair market access for american goods and services it is a test of whether the government of korea will keep its commitments if the administration cant demonstrate convincingly that market access can be achieved in countries which have very large trade surpluses with the united states the concerns of many americans about unfair trade practices among our international trading partners will grow and there will be that much less likelihood of removing the more extreme protectionst trade provisions from the omnibus trade bill which is currently in conference at this time a quite appropriate section 301 case regarding koreas treatment of the united states beef has been filed with the office of the united states special trade representative independently the ustp raised the issue lt a gatt dispute panel last week in geneva switzerland while the united states was assured or placated last year that some liberalization would occur once the korean presidential elections were concluded nothing substantive has been forthcoming from the koreans we are now being told that no action may be taken prior to the upcoming parliamentary elections in korea because united states beef exports would be a sensitive political issue quite frankly a total ban on united states beef is a sensitive issue here too i would remind the korean government that we have been patient too long what will be the next excuse for inaction that is offered it is time to set these political excuses aside unitedstates cattle producers have had enough the time for stonewalling and excuses is over i would encourage the ustr to accept the 301 case which it has pending and to proceed full speed in prosecuting the case korea is no longer an impoverished country it now has a responsibility to play fairly in the world trading environment which has enabled it to prosper in light of our huge trade deficit with korea it is not unreasonable to have open access to the korean market the elimination of koreas restrictions on united states beef would be an excellent start if protecting korean beef producers is politically sensitive they can do the same thing that the japanese should dodirectly subsidize their beef producers they can pay them and permit the korean and japanese consumers to reap the advantages of more highquality beef at much much lower prices again thank you korea for purchasing our grain but please be fair and live up to your promises to remove the beef ban as the first step in an immediate action to begin a speedy phaseout of beef quotas we appreciate your grain and soybean business but given your huge trade surplus with us we can and do expect to be your supplier of quality grain and soybeans at competitive pricesplus beef and a whole range of food productswhich your consumers would readily buy if given a chance"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a few minutes ago when we discussed the abortion issue the gentleman from illinois recognized home rule as an important principle and said he was prepared to stand by home rule buy only when human rights itself was at stake to hold that principle higher than home rule i suggest there is nothing that we are discussing now that justifies a similar conclusion as to this amendment for the fact of the matter is that this amendment that is proposed or the position that is proposed by the gentleman from california mr dannemeyeri will accomplish nothing and the reason for that is very simple georgetown and the district of columbia have reached an agreement in resolution of their dispute georgetown is quite happy with that agreement they have written all and sundry who have inquired about it stating that the entire georgetown community faculty administrators students alumni all are happy with the agreement and that regardless of what congress does as to the armstrong amendment georgetown will not change the stance it now has which it considers educationally sound that position as this bill moves along will be offered by the gentleman from california who will exert his right under our rules after we have receded to offer a motion which will take preference to concur with an amendment as i understand it that amendment that motion to concur with an amendment will fully spell out georgetowns right to express its views on any question in full keeping with its first amendment rights both freedom of speech and freedom of religion georgetown is perfectly happy with that solution to the problem so what basis at all is there for us to be trying to legislate with respect to the district of columbia i would finally like to appeal to my colleagues simply on the basis of protecting the prerogatives of the house of representatives the fact of the matter is that an amendment of the kind we are being asked to recede to here cannot be passed during ordinary house consideration of an appropriation bill because it permits an appropriation to take effect only if someone else takes some nonministerials act and that kind of an amendment has consistently been ruled out of order as legislating on an appropriation bill if we are going to accept these kinds of amendments when they are offered on the senate side where the senate binds itself by no such rule then we are continually going to be putting ourselves at a disadvantage with respect to the senate today it is only the district of columbia authorizing committee that is hurt by the action and i know members around here unlesss they come from the metrop~olitan area do not pay a lot of attention to the workings of that committee but i say to every other member of the house on every other authorizing committee maybe it is the district of columbia committee this time whose ox is being gored but the same can be done in the way of legislation on appropriation bills in the senate on any other appropriation bill that comes through if you are going to start the practice of giving away to this kind of activity on the part of the senate time after time on this bill you know they will start using other appropriation bills to take advantage of our authorizing committees just the same way they are taking advantage of the district of columbia committee here it is time for us in the house to insist on our prerogatives to put a stop to that encroachment by the other body i hope therefore members will support the chairman of the subcommittee in this effort"]]}
