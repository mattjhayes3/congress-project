restore economic growth in our economy and my topic this afternoon will deal with how we can cut down the deficit for 1983 and indeed create a balanced budget for fiscal year 1983 beginning on october 1 primarily let me observe that today 928 000 workers in the construction industry are out of work that is 18 1 percent of the total in that industry two hundred and fifty thousand of the workers in the automobile industry are out of work that is 20 8 percent of the workers in that industry these two industries together total 1 178 000 workers who are out of work because of a decline in their industries the principal question is why in the opinion of this member from california the reason or the answer to that question is highinterest rates currently the prime in this country is about 16 percent how do we get that prime rate down the answer is that we must reduce the quantity of borrowing which the federal government contemplates taking from the credit markets over the course of the next year how do we do that we have got to reduce the size of the deficit now when you serve in this house in this institution it almost exudes from the walls that you really cannot cut spending of the federal government that it is part and parcel of the premises and it is impossible to really do it well this member from california yesterday made a presentation to the budget committee whereby a plan was presented that we could balance the budget in 1983 i would like to talk about that this afternoon as we prepare to do battle over the budget this year as we have done in the past i am sure that all of us are not just a little more uneasy this time about the budgetary socioeconomic financial and political ramifications of being confronted with the largest deficit in our nations history we are simply not following the script very well which if we recall why our constituents sent us here 18 months ago calls for movement in the opposite direction we are supposed to be balancing the budget not busting it it becomes imperative therefore for us to find an alternative to the administrations fiscal year 1983 budget a chief obstacle which has thus far prevented us from coalescing around an acceptable substitute is the continuing debate over economic assumptions in february the office of management and budget indicated that the fiscal year 1983 deficit would be 107 2 billionincluding offbudget itemsthe congressional budget office estimates the onbudget deficit alone will be closer to 157 billion the variation in just the onbudget deficit exceeds 70 percent due to acceptance of differing assumptions as to gnp growth inflation interest rates unemployment and changes in law with fluctuations of as little as 1 percent accounting for billions of dollars in changes to the budget it becomes nearly impossible for us to correctly predict what the final figures will be because of this uncertainty it becomes even more important for the congress to take decisive action on the budget and reduce the projected deficitwhether 100 billion or 200 billionby an amount large enough and meaningful enough to make a critical difference large enough to relieve much of the constrictive pressure on the credit markets and meaningful enough so that the message to both taxpayers and the business community would be clear as to our intention to finally do something about outofcontrol federal spending i submit therefore that despite protestations to the contrary not only must the budget be balanced it can be or to be more exactbecause of continued volatility of economic assumptionsas closely balanced as possible under existing circumstances this can be accomplished by cutting 110 billion from the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit whatever that figure may ultimately be a cut of this magnitude would certainly be large enough to materially affect financial markets and meaningful enough to send a clear message that we are finally serious about putting the nations fiscal house in order my program for reducing the deficit by 110 billion can be divided into two underlying premises seven direct components and two indirect additives as follows premises first measures undertaken to reduce the fiscal year 1983 budget should encompass the final 6 months of fiscal year 1982 as well such measures as freezing current benefit levels scaledback increases selective cuts rescissions deferrals or eliminations ought to be implemented as soon as possible inasmuch as fiscal year 1982 spending is not only excessive to begin with but alsobecause of its exaggerated deficithas contributed significantly to the fluctuating and undermining economic indicators after all the more pessimistic analyses including the congressional budget offices result from the higher deficits interest rates and unemployment and lower productivity and revenues caused by the fiscal year 1982 budget i believe that by attacking the fiscal year 1982 deficit at least partially we will affect the economic indicators in such a way as to make the administrations original forecasts and assumptions more feasible and acceptable and even though it may be too late to reduce actual spending for this yearfiscal year 1982in many programs budget cuts based upon fiscal year 1982 levels of spending ought to be possible in most cases this is especially important for two reasons fiscal year 1983 spending is largely an extension of fiscal year 1982as well as previousspending and larger cuts are possible in the more egregiouslyinflated fiscal year 1982 budget than in

regulations which provide jurisdiction over civil rights complaints has often been to deny swift and fair justice for persons who have been discriminated against the backlog in federal agencies creates unnecessary delays additional costs and causes further overcrowding in already overburdened federal courts this problem is not endemic to the reagan administration in 1977 many of those who

conference disagrees with some of the specifics of the bill as well as its timing they are in accord with the view that civil rights enforcement should be strengthened their recent report on the current problems of the justice departments enforcement efforts reflect their deep concern with this important issue the civil rights act of 1982 provides uniform procedures and requires prompt investigation and resolution of civil rights complaints agencies which are responsible for program evaluation and civil rights compliance retain the authority to conduct investigations and attempt to resolve complaints for the first time overall enforcement is centralized and made mandatory i hope that the congress views this legislation as a basis for exploration of critical issues in federal

camps she said it all started in 1949 when her husband was arrested for being a member of a ukranian nationalist association and writing zamizdat the underground press he was sentenced to 30 years that began strokatakaravanskis long stuggle to secure freedom for her husband she petitioned the government and like her companion nadia svitlychny wrote of her husbands plight for the underground press in 1972 when the soviet government began staging mass arrests of ukranian intellectuals and artists these women fled to the caucasus in the north for safety unfortunately it was to no avail for the police were not long in catching them no reason was given for strokatakaravanskis arrest but she is certain it stemmed from her fight on behalf of her husband she spent 4 years at the labor camp before being released in december 1975 four more years elapsed while she waited for her husband to complete his 30year term today after half a lifetime of waiting and hoping the two have been reunited

nation has always stood for and that other members will see that in their own congressional districts there are voices of ethnic americans who have a firm and clear understanding of what the problems

indeed create a balanced budget for fiscal year 1983 beginning on october 1 primarily let me observe that today 928 000 workers in the construction industry are out of work that is 18 1 percent of the total in that industry two hundred and fifty thousand of the workers in the automobile industry are out of work that is 20 8 percent of the workers in that industry these two industries together total 1 178 000 workers who are out of work because of a decline in their industries the principal question is why in the opinion of this member from california the reason or the answer to that question is highinterest rates currently the prime in this country is about 16 percent how do we get that prime rate down the answer is that we must reduce the quantity of borrowing which the federal government contemplates taking from the credit markets over the course of the next year how do we do that we have got to reduce the size of the deficit now when you serve in this house in this institution it almost exudes from the walls that you really cannot cut spending of the federal government that it is part and parcel of the premises and it is impossible to really do it well this member from california yesterday made a presentation to the budget committee whereby a plan was presented that we could balance the budget in 1983 i would like to talk about that this afternoon as we prepare to do battle over the budget this year as we have done in the past i am sure that all of us are not just a little more uneasy this time about the budgetary socioeconomic financial and political ramifications of being confronted with the largest deficit in our nations history we are simply not following the script very well which if we recall why our constituents sent us here 18 months ago calls for movement in the opposite direction we are supposed to be balancing the budget not busting it it becomes imperative therefore for us to find an alternative to the administrations fiscal year 1983 budget a chief obstacle which has thus far prevented us from coalescing around an acceptable substitute is the continuing debate over economic assumptions in february the office of management and budget indicated that the fiscal year 1983 deficit would be 107 2 billionincluding offbudget itemsthe congressional budget office estimates the onbudget deficit alone will be closer to 157 billion the variation in just the onbudget deficit exceeds 70 percent due to acceptance of differing assumptions as to gnp growth inflation interest rates unemployment and changes in law with fluctuations of as little as 1 percent accounting for billions of dollars in changes to the budget it becomes nearly impossible for us to correctly predict what the final figures will be because of this uncertainty it becomes even more important for the congress to take decisive action on the budget and reduce the projected deficitwhether 100 billion or 200 billionby an amount large enough and meaningful enough to make a critical difference large enough to relieve much of the constrictive pressure on the credit markets and meaningful enough so that the message to both taxpayers and the business community would be clear as to our intention to finally do something about outofcontrol federal spending i submit therefore that despite protestations to the contrary not only must the budget be balanced it can be or to be more exactbecause of continued volatility of economic assumptionsas closely balanced as possible under existing circumstances this can be accomplished by cutting 110 billion from the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit whatever that figure may ultimately be a cut of this magnitude would certainly be large enough to materially affect financial markets and meaningful enough to send a clear message that we are finally serious about putting the nations fiscal house in order my program for reducing the deficit by 110 billion can be divided into two underlying premises seven direct components and two indirect additives as follows premises first measures undertaken to reduce the fiscal year 1983 budget should encompass the final 6 months of fiscal year 1982 as well such measures as freezing current benefit levels scaledback increases selective cuts rescissions deferrals or eliminations ought to be implemented as soon as possible inasmuch as fiscal year 1982 spending is not only excessive to begin with but alsobecause of its exaggerated deficithas contributed significantly to the fluctuating and undermining economic indicators after all the more pessimistic analyses including the congressional budget offices result from the higher deficits interest rates and unemployment and lower productivity and revenues caused by the fiscal year 1982 budget i believe that by attacking the fiscal year 1982 deficit at least partially we will affect the economic indicators in such a way as to make the administrations original forecasts and assumptions more feasible and acceptable and even though it may be too late to reduce actual spending for this yearfiscal year 1982in many programs budget cuts based upon fiscal year 1982 levels of spending ought to be possible in most cases this is especially important for two reasons fiscal year 1983 spending is largely an extension of fiscal year 1982as well as previousspending and larger cuts are possible in the more egregiouslyinflated fiscal year 1982 budget than in its fiscal year 1983 successor witness the increase from fiscal year 1981 to fiscal year 1982 of 67 billionomb estimatesin totl outlays as opposed
