jobs their policies are developing bigger jobs bigger government here in washington d c so much so that the only city in this country that real estate prices have not gone down is washington d c

because we have excessive and frivolous lawsuits against our own energy production and it has significantly delayed and in many cases prevented our energy resources from reaching the american marketplace h r 1032 the relief act doesnt stop people from having their day in court but what it would do is it would allow the environmental wackos that are trying to stop energy production here in this country from having this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from the frivolous lawsuits by allowing the prevailing party to be able to seek legal fees and other expenses under the act this

it is the very first time that we have done so while making corresponding cuts in spending that exceed the ceiling increase to most of us this is just good common sense its the only responsible thing

aware of the mortal dangers he would face yet when he was offered a posting to a ceremonial position stateside he turned it down he believed his duty and destiny was to keep the fight away from our shores away from his family and his country and so he chose combat even when he had been offered safe and honorable service at home what did he sacrifice in order to give our country a little more

and victor would lift them up i didnt know him but i think i caught a glimpse of him in his little brother kyle at the funeral reception last year i found kyle sitting at a table with his friends when i went to offer my condolences one of his friends said you know we came to cheer him up and instead hes been cheering us up victor lives on in the lives of those he touched and he touched quite a few

he was 12 years old victor dew awoke under a marine corps banner over his bed that was emblazoned with the words semper fidelis in his life we can see the full measure of those words every day in this

this administration since taking office president obama has actively delayed blocked and stalled american energy productionand the american people are sick of these stalling tactics thats why the house of representatives is concentrating on three key initiatives that will reverse the obama administrations policies that are hurting families and small businesses destroying jobs and increasing our reliance on foreign oil last week the house passed the restarting american offshore leasing now act it will require the secretary of the interior to conduct oil and natural gas lease sales in the gulf of mexico and offshore virginia that have been delayed or canceled by this administration in fact if we dont have an oil lease this year it will be the first time in my lifetime that the american public has not had that yesterday the house voted on the putting the gulf of mexico back to work act since the drilling moratorium was officially lifted in october the administration has chosen to drag their feet and stalled the permitting process in the gulf twelve rigs have already left the gulf for other regions taking hundreds and even thousands of jobs with them this steady decline in oil and natural gas production is costing the united states 4 7 million every day in lost revenues this act speeds up the drilling permitting process and will put thousands of americans back to work today well vote on the reversing president obamas offshore moratorium act the administrations actions have placed the atlantic coast the pacific coast and areas of alaska off limits this act will implement a smart drilling plan requiring the administration to move forward on american energy production in areas containing the most oil and natural gas resources in north mississippi were working at leading the way toward helping our nation become energy secure all three of these bills combined can create up to 1 2 million jobs that will generate revenue that our nation needs and it will put us on the path to achieving energy security of more american oil more natural gas clean coal nuclear energy and new technologies such as wind and solar donna whiteside and the thousands of businesses and families around america need to know that the house of representatives is listening to them the house republican american energy initiatives will free the american people from the obama

create jobs but their policies are destroying jobsamerican jobs private pay jobs their policies are developing bigger jobs bigger government here in washington d c so much so that the only city in this country that real estate prices have not gone down is washington d c theyve gone up why because this administration nancy pelosi harry reid and their colleagues in the house and the senate in the

creating weve got another problem in fact i introduced h r 1032 the relief act because we have excessive and frivolous lawsuits against our own energy production and it has significantly delayed and in many cases prevented our energy resources from reaching the american marketplace h r 1032 the relief act doesnt stop people from having their day in court but what it would do is it would allow the environmental wackos that are trying to stop energy production here in this country from having this endless plethora of lawsuits that stop the permitting and stop the production what it would do is it would require that all lawsuits be filed within 60 days and that the courts would have to have a determination or solution to that case within 180 days and that if the district court ruling was appealed that it would go to the supreme court and the supreme court would have a ruling within another 180 days it would also allow some relief from the frivolous lawsuits by allowing the prevailing

raised the debt ceiling since 1962 seventyfive times it has been raised this is the 76th time yet it is the very first time that we have done so while making corresponding cuts in spending that exceed the ceiling increase to most of us this is just good common sense its the only responsible thing to do yet 75 times before no connection was made between the debt ceiling and efforts to tackle our debt with todays underlying legislation we are fundamentally changing the way business is done here in washington we are setting a new precedent for fiscal discipline and accountability this is a tremendous achievement that will have a profound and lasting impact on our budget and our economy in both the short medium and long term this is an especially critical point to focus on todays

coming out of that we grew jobs the difference the big difference was coming out of world war ii the last time our debt to gdp ratio was near where it is now the difference was and the thing that saved us was the immediate cuts right we cut government spending back but we grew jobs we literally made things here in america you know why we had an environment that fostered job creation we had an

foot in a real forest they think you just tie a big ribbon around it and dont let anybody in or out and thats how we protect our environment theyre wrong you see they think that our environment and
