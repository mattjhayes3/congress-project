and ineffective mass that stretches itsconstitutional authority to the limit how bad is it this year with the introduction of his budget bill clinton claimed his administrations policies had solved the budget crisis his director of omb leon panetta stated that republicans would have killed to be able to offer this budget and we have been exposed to democrat after democrat crowing about the strength of the economy and their success at cutting the deficit what were they all cheering about according to clintons budget the deficit will fall to 175 billion next year then it will rise to 182 billion in 1997 256 billion in 2001 and 365 billion in 2004 in washington this is considered success obviously something stronger is needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the balanced budget amendment first they fear a balanced budget amendment will tie the hands of congress and force it to cut some programs in order to fund others in other words they fear that congress will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second there are those groups who question the effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work or not the answer is the balanced budget amendment will establish the framework under which congress will have to make its spending decisions congress will still have to make the spending decisions but it will be done without the openended funding option now available this is the third time in the last 4 years the house will vote on a balanced budget amendment four years ago opponents of the

rightly so but they also want us to preserve the excellence and the choice they have come to expect and they dont want to see their health care costs go down only to see their taxes go up but as weve shown tonight in this debate all the canadian system can claim is that everyone has access to the system but you have to stop and ask yourself what is the quality of the system how long will i have to wait to getthe test or procedure i need how much more will i pay in taxes they promise that theyll be able to expand access to everyone and no one will have to pay more but remember what your mother told you if it sounds too good to be true it is they cite government estimates and reports produced by the cbo and gao but remember the government has never correctly estimated the cost of its programs thats why congress keeps going back to hardworking americans to ask them to pay more in taxes this case is no different their sole cost containment mechanism is simply to have the government say well have lower costs next year and then forbid hospitals from getting the latest and best equipment but is that how we want costs lowered fortunately there are other options out there if we want to control costs we should target the key cost drivers we should reform our malpractice system to eliminate the unnecessary procedures that are done simply to protect the provider if theyre dragged into court we should adopt a single insuranceform and electronic billing so that administrative costs are lowered we should tighten our fraud laws to eliminate this cost in our system we should reform our antitrust laws so that communities have the opportunity to coordinate the delivery of health care no longer will each hospital have to buy the latest and often most expensive diagnostic tool and if we want someone to control costs it should be the consumer in consultation with his her physician who decides if a treatment is appropriate or not we should allow the creation of medical savings accounts or medisave accounts that are integrated with a catastrophic plan let me explain how this would work on average employers nationwide pay 4 500 per year to buy health coverage for an employee family under our legislation employers would be encouraged to take 1 500 of that 4 500 and purchase a major medical insurance policy that would give employers everything they have now except the insurance policy would have a 3 000 deductible in other words the employee would pay the first 3 000 of health care costs the company would cover that possible 3 000 expense to employees by setting up a medical savings account in the employees name and depositing 3 000 in it each year whenever an employee needed medical service he would go get it wherever he chose and then would present a debit card and the bill would be paid from the 3 000 in his medical savings account anything he didnt spend at years end he would get to keep all of a sudden people have an incentive to make a choice between 200 at the emergency room or 50 at the doctors office because they are spending their own medical savings account money if a family had multiple illnesses the 3 000 would be spent from the account and then the major medical policy would kick in the employee is as well off as he is under the high premium low or no deductible plan he has today but if the employee be exercising prudence can save some of the 3 000 year after year that account can grow as a taxfree ira that money could then be used later in life to purchase longterm care or for other medical services the debate on health care reform has just begun whatever reforms we adopt we should make sure that it controls spiraling costs and makes health insurance affoidable most important we should make sure reform leaves

17 and 18yearold trainees suddenly ceased to be volunteers they were fitted with gas masks and suits and ordered into gas chambers for repeated exposure to lethal gases documentation confirms that the

because i think it is very much in order especially at this time when we have over on the senate side new suggestions for new taxes for more taxes let us review just a moment if i may with the gentleman where we are a lot of talk a lot of rhetoric that came out of the administration in the last few months has confused people where we are first of all we had in this body passed in march the budget bill the budget bill put together by the budget committee and hailed as a great success for the president is generally meaningless i found that the administration does not follow it and the committee on appropriations does not follow it and very few people in this house seem to follow the budget bill so for all practical purposes the great victory of the budget bill is pretty much forgotten between march and today then next came the presidents package of spending his first package of spending it was some s16 billion essentially this spending as i recall was to pay off major political debts and to put some 16 billion out into the economy i remember there was something like a s3 5 million item to puerto rico we all thought in my district that that might stimulate jobs but it was just a little too far for us to commute there were several other million dollars in spending that i saw in puerto rico and other parts but we could not see how spending that kind of money and charging it to a deficit would give us any great momentum here in this country when clearly spending federal government spending was not what was holding our economy back it could not be called a spend your way you know and pay off political debt package so it was 6alled a stimulus package very little stimulus a lot of spending the people in the senate saw through that and they cut that as you recall some 12 billion was cut out of that 16 billion package and only the 4 billion left for unemployment was there then came the third package that was put before us a lot of people think that the package that passed this house a few weeks ago and it really is a tax and spend package but obviously here again the administration was not going to tell the american people it was tax snd spend so it was called a budget reduction package even though it did very little toward reducing the deficit but in this budget reduction package and most people think this is where cuts are made in this body you had essentially as the gentleman has been pointing out numerous taxes placed upon the american people we had social security 85 percent taxation of that social security for the first time to go from the social security fund over to the general fund and start funding general fund matters and let me tell you although that will affect according to the cbo something over 13 5 million people in just a few years it will affect the whole social security fund if we break the seal of saying we can start taking funds in any manner from the social security fund paid for by the workers of this country and using those funds for general appropriations over in the general appropriation bills that is what this is doing for the first time it is establishing that precedent and it is a bad precedent as the gentleman from georgia quite accurately pointed out the gasoline tax is a middleincome tax it is a tax that hurts my region and many rural regions all across america more than it does anyone else the president pointed that out as the gentleman stated a moment ago many other governmental officials said that when they worked up the btu tax that they did not want a gasoline tax that would hurt parts of the country yet we are going to have a gasoline tax in this bill finally i would like to point out that the opportunity to cut is here now now you do not hear much being said about it in the press the administration certainly is not saying anything about this but we are in the process of putting together the nations budget it is going to be somewhere around 51 6 trillion when we finish that budget is put together in 13 appropriations bills there are 13 subcommittees of the committee on appropriations each one appropriates and reports out a package they have been coming to the floor starting last week and they will continue to come to the floor for the next 2 or 3 weeks sometime before the fourth of july this house will have adopted all 13 of those appropriations bills now i know the gentleman knows as i do and we would like to remind all members here today that this is the time this is the place to make cuts in the budget this is the time to save money this is the time to try to reel back this massive deficit this is the time to speak up if you really feel that you want to make cuts now we have seen very little from the administration in fact the administration has come into the subcommittees i represent and asked for increases in spending not cuts in most cases i would say that we have coming in a few weeks a bill from commerce justice and state in that and i am speaking toward one item it sounds like a small item when you talk about 1 6 trillion and it is only 400 million now 400 million represents a great percentage of the budgets of a lot of states but in terms of 1 6 trillion it is not that much but it is called the fund for the legal services corporation it has grown dramatically over the last few years when you ask what does it do a lot of people think it provides criminal defense for indigent people it does not we have a public defender fund that will have something close to 300 million in it that provides for public defense for indigent

a lot of us question there was a distinguished gentleman in our committee that was a former mayor that pointed out quite vividly something that i have spent time checking and see that it is more than just his city where the program in public housing that was designed to eject drug pushers for public housing was started by secretary kemp in the last administration it was very successful in trying to eradicate drug pushers from public housing it was successful in most cities until in many cases the legal services corporation came in and took the case of the drug pushers and in fact stopped the process because it could break city governments they did not have enough money to put up with the hundreds of millions of dollars we are providing the legal services corporation now when i heard this i was much impressed i said can it be so so i checked with other municipalities many of them said yes this is exactly right we have virtually stopped our ejection program in public housing because many of these people can rely on an unending amount of federal tax pay legal services for defense and we cannot with city tax paid dollars fight that sort of program now i am not here to say that there are not poor people in this country who need legal service there is no question that there are cases where the services that the legal services corporation now provides may be good but we have almost 1 million attorneys in this country we have an opportunity here for the state bars and local bars to provide pro bono for this type of help in fact this is what was done several years ago before legal services came on the scene to provide the kind of help through voluntary agencies this is really an opportunity for the state and local bars to step forward and provide this kind of service and relieve this country of a 400 million and growing expenditure and the bureaucracy that often provides which fights good programs in cities such as the drug eradication program"], [1.0,

abused as a result of this bill the legislation before us codifies the reversal of the moratorium on the use of deliberately aborted babies in federally funded research the legislation neglects to include important safeguards recommended by the 1988 human fetal tissue transplantation research panel thereby allowing for an extreme reversal of federal policy and flagrant disregard for innocent human life the legislation creates ethic advisory boards and entrusts these boards with the authority to determine the appropriateness of specific life threatening and life taking experiments involving unborn babies it is a remarkable power these boards will hold differentiating the acceptability of one horrendous human dissection from another if the past is prolog it is conceivable that experiments and transplantation from living unborn babies will be the next target of federally sanctioned research according to the energy and commerce report of h r 5661 the bill of 1990 in 1974 federalfunded researchers saw fit to conduct experiments on living unborn babies the report details the experiment which the gentleman from california and others point to with high esteem and which i think is unfortunate which involved the administration of the rubella vaccine to pregnant women in the following manner because of the potential risk to the fetus women requesting therapeutic abortion were employed as subjects these volunteers received the vaccine and underwent the abortion 11 to 30 days later examination of tissues from the dead aborted fetuses showed that in contrast to the results in monkeys the vaccine virus did cross the human placenta and infect the fetus in other words these living unborn children were used as guinea pigs deliberately exposed to the rubella vaccine deliberately exposed to this disease while they were still alive again being used as guinea pigs and then killed by the abortionist and then their bodies were dissected to see what happefied what happens if some of those women decided not to abort and these children were affected in a negative way by the disease what would have happened we would have had deliberately induced deformity in a child this brave new world of research regards unborn babies as guinea pig and treats them inhumanly let we remind members that this experiment occurred under the same scenario that 8 1 is establishing no safeguards are included in the bill to prevent this type of socalled research from occurring if you want to get a clear picture of what transplantation looks like and this i believe will become much more rampant as a result of this bill here is a verbatim description of fetal tissue extractions reported in the june 1989 issue of the archives of neurology two methods of collect fetal material were used with the first method a plastic cannula connected to a 60 ml syringe was inserted into the uterus under ultrasound guidance the opening of the cannula was directed to the fetal head suction was applied and the fetus was slowly aspirated and fragmented into the oannula i s i establishes a close relationship between abortionists and medical researchers this collaboration of medical researchers lends credence to the practice and further dehumanizes human life it cheapens the lives of unborn children it seems to me ironic that the policies put forth in s 1 place such a high premium on the value of fetal tissue and individual parts of unborn babies yet we will not acknowledge thd inherent value of that same life as a whole for himself or herself by voting in favor of

state of the union the districts government believes that statehood would signiflcadltly improve the districts ability to meet the needs of its citizens to plan and adopt budgets and to defend itself in the halls of congress let me begin by pointing out that i served on the house appropriations subcommittee on the district of columbia for many years because i care about this city its children its integrity its safety and because this city should represent the best our nation has to offer it is the home of our capital the home of our founders and the home of just under 600 000 people if the point of the statehood legislation is to provide for voting representation for the residents of dc and to provide autonomy and selfreliance then i do not see why an alternative suggestion that accomplishes these same goals should not also be considered my purpose today is to call attention to an alternative to statehood as provided in h r 1205 simply stated i support making the district a city in maryland instead of a statethis idea is called retrocession because we would be returning the land given by maryland to maryland the land that now comprises the district of columbia once belonged to maryland and it makes sense to return the district to the state of maryland minus a reduced federal enclave made up of the federal buildings just as the western portion of the district was returned to virginia in 1846 the federal enclave would be administered by congress as the unitedstates constitution requires current dc residents would become citizens of maryland with full voting representation and retrocession would preserve marylands intent that the land it gave be the seat of government ten ways the district benefits from retrocession first dc residents could run for and vote for at least one voting member in the house two senators and a governor second dc residents could run for and vote for dozens of state senators and delegates to represent washington in annapolis third dc could use the maryland state prisons and law enforcement officers could pursue interjurisdictional drug problems fourth the education system would have the same opportunities and taxing authority that marylands system enjoys fifth retrocession would expand the local ecotnomic base beyond its limited boundaries without the added bureaucracy of a state government sixth most importantly the residents of dc would have voting representation in a way more likely to be accepted by congress than statehood seventh dc residents could tap into transportation services as well as those relating to crime prevention and drug enforcement economic development health and the judicial system eighth dc would no longer be able to justify or pay for the excessive dc payroll by saying that extra people are needed to fulfill statelike functions ninth the districts political candidates would be able to run for statewide offices in maryland which would open up the political system to newcomers with fresh ideas and tenth local laws would no longer be subject to congressional review how do we know that retrocession would work every other democratically based nation throughout the world provides for voting representation in its national legislature for citizens residing in its capital area canada offers a prime example of how this proposal could and does work ottawa lies in ontario and sends representatives to the provincial parliament in toronto and to the federal parliament as part of the ontario delegation it will be said that those of us who are opposed to statehood do not have the best interest of the district citizens at heart well i introduced legislation to allow the district to tax income earned by nonresidents which represents about 60 percent of total income earned in the district finally let me say that the first reaction i get to my proposal from dc politicians is outrage because they say the people of the district would never support becoming a city in maryland however after i introduced retrocession legislation i received several hundred phone calls and letters from dc residents who support my proposal i would argue that many residents of dc would prefer retrocession the question of voter representation for the residents of the district of columbia is an involved serious one but we do a disservice to the people of dc if we limit the

insurance policy that would give employers everything they have now except the insurance policy would have a 3 000 deductible in other words the employee would pay the first 3 000 of health care costs the company would cover that possible 3 000 expense to employees by setting up a medical savings account in the employees name and depositing 3 000 in it each year whenever an employee needed medical service he would go get it wherever he chose and then would present a debit card and the bill would be paid from the 3 000 in his medical savings account anything he didnt spend at years end he would get to keep all of a sudden people have an incentive to make a choice between 200 at the emergency room or 50 at the doctors office because they are spending their own medical savings account money if a family had multiple illnesses the 3 000 would be spent from the account and then the major medical policy would kick in the employee is as well off as he is under the high premium low or no deductible plan he has today but if the employee be exercising prudence can save some of the 3 000 year after year that account can grow as a taxfree ira that money could then be used later in life to purchase longterm care or for other medical services the debate on health care reform has just begun whatever reforms we adopt we should make sure that it controls spiraling costs and makes health
