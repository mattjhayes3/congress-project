have to be and it should not have to be we have too many children who are not getting any kind of attention in texas we cannot allow this to continue it is ironic that we talk about how great we are

nobody wishes to be poor no one wishes to be uneducated no one wishes to be a long ways from various health care outlets but when that happens the entire state ought to have access to that care they

the amendment in the nature of a substitute i will not repeat the arguments i made during the general debate as to why the underlying legislation is very necessary i think the vast majority of the members of this house agree with that proposition the real question is whether it is appropriate to ensure that this legislation once enacted while providing an effective shield for the religious rights of all americans will not be used as a sword against the civil rights of other americans i believe the amendment in the nature of a substitute strikes that balance and does so without doing violence to the underlying purpose of the bill members who support this legislation need not be concerned that the substitute will nullify its protections in any way it is no secret there is substantial concern that establishing a standard that says a state and local law cannot be enforced in any case where someone raises a religious claim unless the state can show a compelling interest in enforcing its law in the specific case causes concerns about whether religious claims will prevail against state and local civil rights laws the committee on the judiciary has received testimony from some supporters of this bill who have testified very forthrightly that they have and will continue to bring free exercise litigation in an effort to undermine some civil rights protections while those religious beliefs may be sincere and entitled to a fair hearing i think it is necessary to strike an appropriate balance without broad carveouts and without politicizing the process if that is possible the amendment recognizes that religious rights are rights that belong to individuals and to religious assemblies and institutions general motors does not have sincerely held religious beliefs by its nature my amendment protects individual and religious institutions in order to protect civil rights laws against the person who would say my religion prohibits me from letting my corporation hire a divorced person or a disabled person or a mother who should be at home with her children or a gay or a lesbian person and it prohibits me from letting my hotel rent a room to such people never mind the state civil rights laws that prohibit this kind of discrimination in order to protect civil rights laws against that sort of religious claim the amendment places some limits on who may raise a claim under this bill against the application of a state or local law any person would have standing any person would have standing under this amendment to raise any claim with respect to any issue with the following narrow exceptions except a claim against the housing discrimination law could be raised only by a small landlord who was exempted by the terms of the fair housing act a claim against an employment discrimination law could be raised only by a small business with five or fewer employees in accord with the general practice of exempting very small businesses from employment discrimination laws or by a church or other religious institution or religious school exercising its right to decide whom to employ based on its religious beliefs with these exceptions businesses of any size could bring any free exercise claims this is important for the mom and pop store that has difficulties with sunday closing laws or with laws allowing malls requiring stores to remain open 7 days a week as well as for large firms that for example produce kosher meat or other products the amendment recognizes that in protecting any rights we are always balancing other peoples rights the courts do it we do it and there is no way around it i think this amendment accomplishe that end i can tell the members that a great deal of work and consultation both with members of the religious coalition which is supporting this bill and with other civil rights groups has gone into developing this language it provides a basis to enact a bill that will pass and that will protect people who are in need of protection i know there are those who will object that this amendment is a carveout a set of exceptions to a general religious protection principle that will set a precedent for many more exceptions and could lead to gutting of the bill to rendering our first freedom a hollow shell i disagree in the first instance this bill already has a carveout that breaks the absolute the principle of indivisibility that we must never have carveouts this bill limits the right of prison inmates to raise otherwise valid claims under the bill by specifically referencing the prison litigation reform act so we already have a carveout in the bill this is simply a second carveout the question is not should we have a carveout but is it important worthwhile and valid i submit that to protect civil rights laws from possible claims under this bill it is a valid protection secondly it is not a carveout in the sense that for instance the prison carveout is where it simply says this shall not apply by reference or this shall not apply to this or that law it is a limitation a narrow limitation on standing which would be very difficult to extend further and which should not be extended any further i believe that without good faith compromise by people with vastly different beliefs it would be difficult to get this bill through the senate through the house and through the president that was our experience with rfra and nothing has changed this amendment provides an opportunity to find the consensus we need to protect the rights of all americans if we could not draft this amendment if we had a stark choice in which we said we can either protect the free exercise of religious rights of people from the damage the supreme court has done to it at the expense of the civil rights of other americans or we can protect the civil rights of americans but not their religious rights that would be a terrible choice indeed this amendment offers us a way to do both protect the religious liberties we need to protect as the gentleman from florida and others have so eloquently expressed but do so without violating or posing a threat to civil rights of americans we ought to do it in the proper way without posing a threat to the civil rights of americans i therefore urge my colleagues to adopt this substitute amendment and reluctantly if the substitute is not adopted i will urge my colleagues to vote against the bill so that we can have further in the process better odds of getting this amendment or something like this into the bill i reserve the balance of my

hawkins former colleagues and complete support of the unitedstates senate the washington post once called gus hawkins one of the most famous unknown men of our day however many of us knew him as a quiet fighter for racial justice social equality and education for minorities women and children i can recall when i came to this floor to be sworn in gus hawkins was sitting right here on this floor with me and he wanted me to so much get on the education committee because for years he and i had worked together in the los angeles unified school district on education and on helping youngsters in the watts area and in other deprived areas of getting a quality education while i could not go on this education committee i really do appreciate the support that he has given me and indeed the support he has given youngsters throughout this nation in trying to bring a quality education to those who otherwise would not have had that gus committed his life to serving others and his 56 years of public service spanned a period that included the great depression world war ii mccarthyism both the korean and vietnam wars the civil rights movement and the war on poverty he witnessed an assassination of a president and the impeachment of another he was born in shreveport louisiana in 1907 when he was 11 he and his family moved to los angeles to escape the racial discrimination that was prevalent in the south at that time his legislative career began in californias state assembly where he served for 28 years and was often the legislatures only black member his record in sacramento included the passage of the states first law against discrimination in housing and employment he also carried successful state legislation concerning minimum wage and wages for women child care centers workers compensation for domestic employees and the removal of racial discrimination on state documents this is the type of man he was after his remarkable tenure in the state assembly of california gus was elected and sworn as a member of this body in the 88th congress in 1962 he served as chairman of the joint committee on printing in the 97th congress the joint committee in the 97th congress as well as the committee on house administration in that same congress and he served in the 98th congress as well on that committee before serving as chairman of the committee on education and labor in the 101st congress by and large gus hawkins was known by his colleagues as a hard working trustworthy lowkey legislator who concentrated on issues of importance to his district which included the watts area he preferred to do his work behind the scenes and let others capture the headlines he is the author of more than 17 federal laws including the full employment and balanced growth act title vii of the civil rights act establishing the equal employment opportunity commission the job training partnership act the school improvement act which rewrote virtually all major elementary and secondary education programs and the civil rights restoration act in 1978 he coauthored and passed the humphreyhawkins full employment act which pledged federal government efforts to reduce unemployment by four percent by 1983 if the private sector failed to do so the humphreyhawkins can be seen as guss great effort legislative accomplishments because it established a real blueprint for moving this country ahead in job training and employment the foundation to every other policy and an area that gus hawkins firmly believed that we had to have job training and quality education for quality employment throughout his remarkable career in public service gus has championed the rights of children the poor the elderly the working people and minorities but the one thing that is so noble about this man he never forgot who he was and where he came from nor did he forget the people whom he served it is only fitting that we rise to pay tribute to him by redesignating

surplus of 232 billion this is a 53 billion increase from the april projection and over the next decade the cbo expects the surplus to grow between 4 5 trillion and 5 7 trillion significantly more than what was expected just 3 months ago albert einstein is quoted as having once said the only justifiable purpose of political institutions is to ensure the unhindered development of the individual as a political institution we must do just that to ensure the pursuit of science and unraveling the mysteries of mankind by way of science and knowledge we are ensuring the unhindered development of the individual the national institutes of health is a world renowned institution located in montgomery county maryland it is considered the leading force in mankinds continued war against all forms of cancer hiv aids blindness autoimmune diseases mental illness and so many lifethreatening and debilitating diseases i doubt if there is one person in this congress whose life or family is not affected by a disease that depends on the research being funded by nih it is not by chance that the united states is the undisputed world leader in hightech medical science and drug development it is in large part because the federal government has made a commitment to fund basic biomedical research for over 50 years and create a strong partnership with the private sector to bring new lifesaving treatments to patients throughout the world the federal commitment to biomedical behavioral and populationbased research is responsible for the continued development of an everexpanding base that has contributed to medical advances that have profoundly improved the length and the quality of life for all americans these are remarkable times never before in the history of mankind have we experienced such an explosion of discoveries information gained from nih research is revolutionizing the practice of medicine and the future direction of scientific inquiry recently the international human genome project partners and celera genomics corporation jointly announced that they have completed a working draft assembly of the human genome this is a truly significant milestone for science and medicine for the first time in our history researchers have available with just a few clicks on their computer the nearly 3 1 billion letters that make up the human instruction book all of the sequence data produced by the publicly supported human genome project is deposited daily in genbank a freely available sequence database maintained by the nihs national center for biotechnology information public consortium centers produce far more sequence data than expected in a matter of about 15 months 22 billion bases or letters of raw sequence data was produced providing sevenfold coverage of the human genome as a result the working draft is substantially closer to the ultimate finished form than the consortium expected at this stage this is an nih success story reaching this milestone is just the beginning the project now turns more of its energy and resources to the development of tools to understand the instructions encoded in the billions of bases of dna sequence alterations in our genes are responsible for an estimated 5 000 clearly hereditary diseases such as huntingtons disease cystic fibrosis and sicklecell anemia they are also believed to influence the development of thousands of others more common diseases such as schizophrenia alzheimers disease cancers heart disease diabetes and arthritis as a result decoding this information is expected to lead to powerful new ways to prevent diagnose treat and cure disease this will occupy the time and energy of biomedical scientists for decades to come when will there be a better time to invest in biomedical research than now i do not know of one

cancer heart disease and stroke with so many of these diseases that are debilitating or lifethreatening we are so close so close to the finish line in finding a cure and being able to provide for a

deadline this year however it is also true that keeping our fiscal house in order does take a little longer than the freewheeling bigspending days of the past because we must ensure that all funding is spent efficiently and where it is needed the most the conference report before us this afternoon not only holds the line on the presidents additional spending requests but also responsibly funds areas important to every american citizen and protects the american people from waste fraud and abuse across the entire federal government earlier this year the republican congress made a commitment to end the 30year raid on social security and according to the congressional budget office we have now completed that task the president began the budget negotiations by taking a large step toward our position on the social security issue and joined us in locking away every penny of social security we worked with him in a bipartisan fashion to protect retirement security we were determined to protect american seniors and this congress and its leadership denied any piece of legislation on the house floor that spent one penny of it to achieve our goal of protecting american seniors and responsibly funding important programs we are including in this bill a plan to direct every federal agency to reduce spending by less than onehalf of one percent 38 percent of 1 percent by routing out waste fraud and abuse surely the government can save less than about half a penny out of every dollar this republican congress is simply asking those who run federal agencies to make fiscally responsible budgeting decisions with the money taxed out of our paychecks we all know the agency directors and executives know where the waste is and i am relatively certain they will be able to weed out at least that much in savings with this sensible plan in addition to meeting the fiscally responsible objectives this conference report also ensures that our principles of quality and flexibility in the funding for teachers have been met in the laborhhs section of the bill this congress ensures that funding may no longer be used to hire unqualified teachers provides that schools will have more flexibility in using their funding for improving the qualityof uncertified teachers and increases the amount of funding that may used for professional training for teachers the administration pushed for a onesizefitsall mandate in which washington controlled the 100 000 new teachers program not every district needs new teachers some need bettertrained teachers other districts need books hightech equipment and updated math and reading programs i think it is foolish for the washington bureaucracy to tell every school district in america that washington knows best how to spend tax dollars to educate our children the debate in washington is not only about money it is also about how that money should be spent this bill moves us closer to the right balance of education funding by providing additional funds for americas students through programs like pell grants and special education while lowering the bureaucratic burden imposed by washington through programs like goals 2000 the

indeed political corruption is a problem but todays reformers hardly offer a solution the real problem is that government has too much influence over our economy and lives creating a tremendous incentive to protect ones own interests by investing in politicians the problem is not a lack of federal laws or rules regulating campaign spending therefore more laws wont help we hardly suffer from too much freedom any effort to solve the campaign finance problem with more laws will only make things worse by further undermining the principles of liberty and private property ownership the reformers are sincere in their effort to curtail special interest influence on govemment but this cannot be done while ignoring the control government has assumed over our lives and economy current reforms address only the symptoms while the root cause of the problem is ignored since reform efforts involve regulating political speech through control of political money personal liberty is compromised tough enforcement of spending rules will merely drive the influence underground since the stakes are too high and much is to be gained by exerting influence over government legal or not the more open and legal campaign expenditures are with disclosure the easier it is for voters to know whos buying influence from whom theres tremendous incentive for every special interest group to influence government every individual bank or corporation that does business with government invests plenty in influencing government lobbyists spend over a hundred million dollars per month trying to influence congress taxpayers dollars are endlessly spent by bureaucrats in their effort to convince congress to protect their own empires government has tremendous influence over the economy and financial markets through fnterest rate controls contracts regulations f6ans and grants cortorations and others are forced toparticipate in the process out of reed as well s selfdefeie since thats the way the system works equalizing competition and balancing power such as between labor and business is a common practice as long as this system remains in place the incentive to buy influence will continue many reformers recognize this and either like the system or believe that its futile to bring about changes and argue that curtailing influence is the only option left even if it involves compromising the liberty of political speech through regulating political money its naive to believe stricter rules will make a difference if enough honorable men and women served in congress and resisted the temptation to be influenced by any special interest group of course this whole discussion would be unnecessary because members do yield to the pressure the reformers believe that more rules regulating political speech will solve the problem the reformers argue that its only the fault of those trying to influence government and not the fault qf the members who yield to the pressure or the system that generates the abuse this allows members of congress to avoid assuming responsibility for their own acts and instead places the blame on those who exert pressure on congress through the political process which is a basic right bestowed on all americans the reformers argument is stop us before we succumb to the special interest groups politicians unable to accept this responsibility clamor for a system that diminishes the need for politicians to persuade individuals and groups to donate money to their campaign instead of persuasion they endorse coercing taxpayers to finance campaigns this only changes the special interest groups that control government policy instead of voluntary groups making their own decisions with their own money politicians and bureaucrats dictate how political campaigns will be financed not only will politicians and bureaucrats gain influence over elections other nondeservers will benefit clearly incumbents will greatly benefit by more controls over campaign spendinga benefit to which the reformers will never admit the media becomes a big winner their influence grows as private money is regulated it becomes more difficult to refute media propaganda both print and electronic when directed against a candidate if funds are limited campaigns are more likely to reflect the conventional wisdom and candidates will strive to avoid media attacks by accommodating their views the wealthy gain a significant edge since its clear candidates can spend unlimited personal funds in elections this is a big boost for the independently wealthy candidates over the average challenger who needs to raise and spend large funds to compete celebrities will gain even a greater benefit than they already enjoy celebrity status is money in the bank and by limiting the resources to counterbalance this advantage works against the noncelebrity who might be an issueoriented challenger this current reform effort ignores the legitimate and moral political action committees that exist only for good reasons and do not ask for any special benefit from government the immoral political action committees that work only to ripoff the taxpayers by getting benefits from government may deserve our condemnation but not the heavy hand of government anxious to control this group along with all the others the reformers see no difference between the two and are willing to violate all personal liberty since more regulating doesnt address the basic problem of influential government now out of control neither groups deserves more coercive government rules all the rules in the world cant prevent members from yielding to political pressure of the groups that donate to their campaigns regulation cannot instill character additionally the legislative debate over campaign finance reform has seemingly focused upon the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech as interpreted and applied by the courts the constitutional issues however are not limited to the first amendment to the contrary pursuant to their oaths of office members of congress have an independent duty to determine the constitutionality of legislation before it and to decide before ever reaching the first amendment whether they have been vested by the constitution with any authority at all to regulate federal election campaigns congress has no authority except that which is granted in the constitution thus the threshold question concoming h r 417 is whether the constitution has conferred upon congress any authority to regular federal election campaigns the authority to regulate such campaigns is not found among any enumerated power conferred upon congress more regulation of political speech through control of private money without addressing the subject of influential government only drives the money underground further giving a select group an advantage over the honest candidate who only wants smaller

first let me thank the chairman of the subcommittee on africa of the committee on international relations for yielding me the time i want to remind those individuals who have listened to this debate my colleagues that we would not let this bill proceed without embracing the backbone of america as i indicated 99 7 percent of the new jobs and jobs created in america in this very good economy have been created by small businesses i think it is important to note that there is not one state in the united states that does not have a coloration to indicate that they are not doing business in africa i think it is also important when we begin to analyze this bill that we see africa in multicolors it would almost be like taking a portrait that our very esteemed africanamerican artist john biggers paints he paints with a lot of colors going in and looking at the painting and saying it looks like there is all blue we realize that there is poverty in africa that there is need for education health care running water and electricity when we speak to the heads of government they are prepared to engage internatiohally to secure those particular needs of their people why can we not as we recognize how much we do with africa provide the forum and the vehicle for not only the large corporations but our small businesses i hope that the large corporations i hope that opic the department of commerce the small business administration are listening just for information let me note that opic has a small business advocacy team a small business hotline a web page howto materials only for small

to remain a child the donation by mr jones will assure that we will be able to hold onto history and be less ignorant of it while being wiser thomas jefferson was not only the drafter of the declaration of independence and unitedstates president he was also an enlightened thinker whose ideas helped us build this country and guide her through dark times his ideas and thoughts were shaped and influenced by books it is appropriate that the gift from mr and mrs jones will help restore jeffersons rare books as he helped found the library of congress as this country still wrestles with issues of equality and freedom well into the 21st century it is incumbent upon us to refer to the highminded ideals of our founding fathers the 1 million donation to the library of congress will help

this year marks the 55th anniversary of the german ardennes offensive of december 1944 more commonly known as the battle of the bulge in the weeks leading up to the christmas of 1944 it appeared to the western allies that victory over the german army was near at hand many thought that one final push was all that was needed to force a total collapse of german resistance on the western front what the allied commanders were not aware of was the fact that the german dictator was planning one final desperate offensive through the ardennes forest in the hopes of splitting the allied lines the german attack came as a total surprise and achieved initial success poor weather prevented allied air superiority from being brought to bear and the german panzers took full advantage of the respite yet in the end their offensive failed the offensive failed because american soldiers shook off their initial shock and fought with a stubborn tenacity to prevent a german breakthrough the allied lines gave way hence the bulge description but refused to break after several days the weather cleared and the overwhelming allied advantage in tactical air power was finally brought to bear in a concentrated counterattack the resolution honors those courageous veterans who fought in the battle of the bulge resulting in a tenacious defense under horrible conditions against an enemy with superior armored forces their success in halting the german ardennes offensive preserved the allied lines and helped to maintain the offensive pressure on germany the efforts of our veterans in the battle of the bulge like those of all americans who fought against tyranny in world war ii deserve our recognition and respect accordingly i urge my colleagues to join in supporting this measure which

deputies everywhere in doing so they are obviously going to incur the wrath of a lot of folks there are people who want to get them because they have done that people who would harm them or their families whether they are on active duty or have retired this measure allows a police officer on active duty fully qualified as long as he has no disciplinary action pending and meets the standards of qualification of his agency to carry a concealed weapon into any other state wherever he travels to protect himself or his family it also allows the retired police officer as long as that police officer is qualified has served more than at least 5 years or more as an active police officer and during the most recent 12month period of time has gone through compliance with the firearms qualifications standard of the active officers of his agency of the government it allows the retired officer under those circumstances in good standing to also carry concealed weapons across state lines to protect themselves and their family this is extremely important to the police i can guarantee you every police organization i have talked to as chairman of this subcommittee for several years has advocated this every corrections group every sheriffs group the reason for it is very obvious because of the need to protect themselves and their families after they have retired as well as during active duty so i think we owe it to our nations law enforcement community to pass this provision it is long overdue we have struggled to get it out here on the floor the gentleman from california is

abuses including targeted killings of civilians the commander of the brigade at the time was yet another soa graduate as the new york times wrote an institution so clearly out of tune with american

pin signifying that this is the 106th congress a pair of black hornrimmed glasses representing the memory of the late great arizona senator barry goldwater goldwater brought a simple plainspoken candor to public life and i think it was typified by his straightforward declaration that as an american people should have the right to join a union but they should likewise have the right not to join a union if they so desire and mindful of some perilous trends in public policy i rise on this occasion this afternoon california is the nextdoor neighbor of arizona and the los angeles unified school district is contemplating a move that portends great cost to the citizens of los angeles and portends a trend that should be fought by all means at the federal level i speak of project labor agreements this is what is being proposed in los angeles this comes to school construction the contractor recognizes the council and its affiliated unions as the exclusive bargaining representatives for the employees engaged in project work covered by this agreement in the la daily news on the editorial page it is noted that even a school board member who often sides with the teachers union cant turn a blind eye to this outrage what is outrageous well quite simply this fact mr speaker the estimates are that this plan could increase construction costs by 10 to 15 percent in the district now lest you think this is only something that los angelenos should be concerned about i would commend to your attention something this house once saw in april of 1998 the vice president of the united states he who last week claimed that he was the father of the internet he who infamously claimed 2 years ago that there was no controlling legalauthority given the outrage of alleged campaign donations to the clintongore team from foreign governments including the peoples republic of china well this selfsame vice president announced that the clintongore team would aggressively pursue linking federal projects to union construction firms now ladies and gentlemen i believe that everyone should have the right to apply to do work and if a union shop is the bidder that is accepted based on its quality of work that is well and good but here is the problem with uniononly agreements as the vice president promised to boss sweeney and others not only is the blatant payoff but in fact it will end up costing the american taxpayer across the width and breadth of our annual budget an additional 5 billion a year now mindful of the florid rhetoric and the feelgood attitude that the president brings when he steps to this podium annually to offer his state of the union message and mindful that sadly his rhetoric does not always square to reality i would invite the president and the vice president and others who claim that project work or uniononly agreements would somehow be beneficial to step up and defend spending an additional 5 billion of taxpayers money because you see there is a better way indeed to use the presidents term there is a third way but that would involve truth and merit rewards and again i say lest there are those who misunderstand if it is a union shop that steps forward with the best ability to do the work well then god bless them and they should be awarded a contract on their merits but to restrict or to claim that this government or indeed any other governmental entity will deal only with union shops is to circumvent freedom of choice freedom of association and fiscal responsibility for to paraphrase goldwaterand perhaps change his phraseology i believe that union firms have a right to bid on a contract but i also believe that open shop firms should have that same right and if an open shop can do the work better then they should be selected"]]}
