this was one of the most difficult years our subcommittee has faced in making appropriations for many of our nations education employment and health and human services programs despite the budget constraints we faced under the direction of our chairman the distinguished member from kentucky we crafted a bill which recognizes the prevailing domestic needs which mustbe addressed and which allocates funds according to these priorities he is to be commended for his leadership in bringing this measure to the floor i would like to also recognize the gentleman from illinois mr john porter the ranking minority member of our subcommittee for the significant contributions he has made to this years bill and the many contributions he has made to the subcommittee over the years special recognition should be made to the outstanding job that the new members of the subcommittee contributed to this process with much enthusiasm i believe that due to the present composition of the members now on the subcommittee a historical perspective has been set with regard to minority and womens issues that will change and shape our labor force health perspective and educational institutions as noted previously the committee drafted h r 2518 in the midst of rigid parameters established by the fiscal year 1994 budget resolution as passed by the house despite the difficulties we faced this bill provides a balanced approach to supporting many of the domestic programs serving students the unemployed the poor the sick and the elderly overall the bill before us today provides a total of 259 8 billion in mandatory and discretionary programs a total of 66 9 billion was allocated in budget authority and 68 2 billion in outlays for the departments of labor health and human services and education the total allocation for the various departments include 175 billion for hhs 28 6 billion for education 10 9 billion for labor and 1 billion for 18 related agencies the bill is 5 7 billion under the presidents budget request for discretionary spending programs and an increase of 4 8 billion over the amount available for fiscal year 1993 under the bill before us today there were many programs which received significant increases in funding for instance the committee bill includes increases for several major programs such as head start child immunization the ryan white care aids programs chapter i education reform and the pell grant program i am proud to have been able to assist in securing increased funding for these programs which improve the quality of life for my constituents as well as citizens across the nation there are several programmatic provisions i would like to mention specifically these are initiatives which i was able to garner support for in the bill under h r 2518 in the area of education title iii graduate institutions obtained an increase of 5 5 million bringing the total funding up to 17 312 000 language was also provided which urges the department of education to give high priority to funding an initiative to expand model programs dedicated to advancing minority ph d and faculty development of particular note are the special programs for the disadvantaged for which i was able to secure a 20 million increase and substantially raised the presidents budget request to a total of 418 5 million howard university received 192 7 million for its academic programs endowment grants research and other programs in addition by amendment funding in the amount of 750 000 will allow for a new study which will address the projected human resourcesincluding people of color and womenand the educational needs of the civilian aviation industry of the future additional language was included which directs the department of education to lend its resources to the development of a program which will help to preserve historical documents located at historically black colleges and universities and land grant institutions funding for the development of the historically black colleges and universities capital financing program in the amount of 375 million over 2 years will help strengthen americas infrastructure and assist in funding vital improvements on hbcus campuses success was also gained at funding the faculty development fellowship program at 4 million which encourages minorities in pursuing doctoral degrees and to become college and university faculty the institute for international public policy a newly created entity was allocated 1 million to respond to competitive proposals and increase the number of minority students entering the foreign and international service in the area of health the disadvantaged minority health improvement act programs were funded at the fiscal year 1993 level since these programs have not yet been authorized i look forward to these programs receiving a much needed increase in funding during conference in an effort to encourage minority participation in biomedical research and in the health care professions in general and to improve the health status of minority americans for those programs supported by the centers for disease control the committee provided increased funding in many areas including aids tuberculosis breast and cervical cancer and prostate cancer the committee approved a s5 million increase in funds for lead poisoning prevention activities and a 5 million increase in funding for the prevention and treatment of diabetes report language reflects the need for special initiatives to prepare recruit and develop members of underrepresented minority groups for careers in public health prevention programs the committee also expressed its concern to the cdc to address minority health concerns with regard to research on asthma on africanamerican children the national institutes of health were given special consideration in funding this year by the subcommittee due to the lack of funding for many vital health initiatives and research projects projected in the presidents budget request special funding was provided to focus on research and health problems that disproportionately impact minorities in the office on research on minority programs which received 356 million report language was included to address the need for additional research on the sickle cell disease which disproportionately affects the africanamerican population report language was used to address longterm planning research on the behavioral development of all ethnic minority children to establish an initiative in the area of minority childhood development concurrently language was used to establish a research initiative on the development of middle childhood years ages 5 to 11 which promises to provide a greater understanding of adolescent and young adult problems including gangs unwanted pregnancies drug and alcohol abuse aids and high school dropout rates lastly recommendations to the administration on aging to implement the provision of the 1993 older americans act would encourage grants to hbcus hispanic centers of excellence in allied gerontology and serve the needs of minority students pursuing careers in aging despite the enhancement of many programs and n light of present budget constraints the committee was forced to either levelfund or cut some programs in order to keep the bill within the ceilings established by the 1994 budget resolution programs targeted to receive reductions in fiscal year 1994 include many educational programs such as cooperative education student literacy corps and library research again i would like to commend chairman natcher for displaying remarkable skill in balancing the many competing interests contained in this bill we had extremelydifficult decisions to make in drafting this bill and

for yielding me this time the test of any trade agreements success must be that it produces economic growth and jobs for american workers when the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations broke off last winter the former administration the congress and virtually all unitedstates business came to the unanimous conclusioh that negotiations had failed to produce agreement that could pass this basic test furthermore by establishing generally weaker international standards for food safety and other issues concerns have been raised that the current text of the agreement makes it possible for other countries to challenge unitedstates health safety environmental and labor standards for the past 3 years the subcommittee on commerce consumer protection and competitiveness which i chair has held hearings looking at the ability of the united states to maintain and enforce strong environmental and food safety standards under trade agreements being negotiated last year the subcommittee took a resolution to the floor which stated that congress would not implement a trade agreement that compromises our countrys healtjh safety environmental and labor laws that resolution was passed unanimously by the full house of representatives our negotiators must make sure that any final agreement in no way qualifies the ability of the united states to establish and enforce standards it deems appropriate to protect the public interest by providing the president with authority to enter into trade agreements to conclude the uruguay round and by extending fast track approval procedures h r 1876 gives the united states a new opportunity to reach a successful agreement in the uruguay round of talks under the general agreements on tariffs and trade all american workers and businessthat is producers of manufactured products services and agricultural goodsmust have access to foreign markets to survive in todays world economy total world trade which reached 3 4 trillion in 1991 and grew by more than 60 percent since 1986 is clearly the worlds primary generator of economic growth since 1947 seven rounds of gatt negotiations have brought about huge reductions in tariffs on industrial products and have made a major contribution to the expansion of world trade but estimates are that about onethird of total world trade occurs totally outside the gatt framework of trade rules the uruguay round was begun in 1986 largely in an effort to develop rules that would promote trade in areas that currently are not dealt with on a comprehensive basis by gatt such as services and agricultural goods while this is certainly a desirable goal it is important to remember that an agreement that hurts unitedstates producers of manufactured goods is not an acceptable price to pay for success in services and agriculture for example the unitedstates must avoid major concessions that threaten whole unitedstates industries like textiles and apparel manufactured products accounted for 82 percent of our total merchandise exports in 1992 while agricultural goods accounted for only 10 percent if the united states were to get everything it wants in agriculture and our services trade surplus were to increase 10 per cent there would only be about a 6 billion improvement in the overall unitedstates trade balance unfortunately many of our gatt partners have tried to use the uruguay round to make changes that hurt not help unitedstates manufacturing for example it is generally recognized that gatt dispute settlement procedures need to be clarified and strengthened our trading partners have tried to use the uruguay round primarily to impose new restrictions to prevent the united states from using its unilateral authority under section 301 to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices limitations on our ability to use 301 authority is too high a price to pay for improvements in gatt dispute settlement similarly unitedstates efforts to reduce world subsidies and to prevent dumping have been distorted by countries that only want to legitimize subsidies they now extend to their industries and to make it more difficult for the unitedstates to use its only defense against unfair subsidies our countervailing duty law the burden of proof must be on foreign concerns to prove that subsidies are not trade distorting and we should not agree to any change that would force unitedstates firms to meet higher standards of proof in their trade complaints under our countervailing duty laws in addition estimates are that violations of unitedstates intellectual property rights copyrights trademarks and patents has cost unitedstates manufacturers about 14 billion in trade despite this fact the united states and the european community have not agreed on what should be included in an agreement covering intellectual property it is clear that whatever is agreed to on intellectual property will not provide for effective worldwide enforcement as a result it will be very important that the final agreement coming out of the uruguay round not prevent the united states from using authority like that under section 337 of the tariff act which restricts the sale of imports that infringe on unitedstates intellectual property rights it will also be important to retain our ability to use special 301 authority that allows the unitedstates trade representative to retaliate against countries that violate unitedstates intellectual property rights these are a few of the areas that still need to be addressed in the final stages of the uruguay round negotiations our negotiators must keep in mind that an agreement that hurts unitedstates manufacturing is not acceptable by giving the president authority contained in h r 1876 our negotiators have another opportunity to complete the uruguay round in a way that benefits american workers and business including americas manufacturing industries 01250"], [0.1436023712158203,

colleague from kansas our fearless leader on the commit tee on agriculture tonights debate for me is really the whole reason why i ran for congress the whole reason i got into this crazy business in the first place is because i recognized what the deficit and the national debt was doing to our kids and maybe selfishly doing to my kids in fact when my son mark was born there was a bill in his crib because of the deficit and debt in thiscountry of 15 000 you might think well jny son is what paying more than his fair share no every person in this country has that kind of bill sitting at their table right now to pay as a result of our problems so what do we do what do we do we hear about cutting we hear about fair share well fair share has definitely been provided by farmers in fact over the past decade as my colleague for kansas indicated farmers have contributed 57 billion to deficit reduction 57 billion are we complaining no maybe a little bit only because we feel that maybe some other sectors have not contributed as much but we will take that and we will even up the ante farmers have told me we will contribute more in deficit reduction through more spending cuts so the committee on agriculture this year was asked to make a few cuts we did we cut 12 9 billion out of farm progranis for farmers in the committee on agriculture we went along with it only because we knew we had to provide our fair share but only until we found out what that savings was going for you know what it was going for the same thing farmers across the country complain about all the time the fact that we use farm program reductions for food stamp increases increases 7 3 billion was increased in this agriculture budget because 6f the effect of get this the btu tax you might ask what is going on here the clinton administration believes that because of the effects of the btu tax that they are going to have to increase food stamps 7 9 billion just to make up the difference the committee on agriculture cannot stand for that republicans stand firm on the fact that those cuts should not go if we are going to cut in agriculture programs it needs to go to deficit reduction and not toward food stamp programs when there has been no reform of the program no revitalization no streamlining no efficiencies that is promised down the line just like everything else has been promised in this country but nothing was done today the btu tax is supposed to bring in 70 billion over the next 5 years but in order to offset that we have increased welfare programs 40 billion because we expect because of the btu tax more and more people to be dependent on welfare forced into that dependency we heard just a moment ago the majority leader indicate that arent we special we are increasing the earned income tax credit why somebody needs to ask him that because the btu tax is driving people into poverty the farmer must take the risk the farmer must grow the food the farmer must transport the food then he has got to finance the food then he has got to market the food then he has to sell the food and now we are telling farmers stand in line in order to earn food stamps so you can buy back your food and that is ridiculous in this kind of economy what are we telling the young farmers out there we are telling them dont come back to the farm dont come back to the farm we dont need you we dont need you just make farmers get bigger get bigger spend more money that is what we are encouraging them to do none of those young farmers that iowa has lost or any other district in this country are going to come running back to the farm in order to grow food under this kind of a plan that is ridiculous that is not economic growth and revitalization clinton talked about patriots in his state of the union address he talked about all americans being patriots farmers are patriots they are not patsies and we cannot stand for a btu tax that is offset by welfare programs to drive farmers into welfare so that they can in fact be eligible for those same programs in a recent tax foundation study that just came out today iowa alone because of the effect of the btu tax according to this independent foundation is going to lose 4 779 jobs that is economic growth folks in fact my district alone if this btu tax passes is going to lose 890 jobs in just my district is that economic growth ask yourself who of you out there is willing to give up your job for this btu tax there are a lot of congressmen i think who are probably going to lose their job over this let me tell you this about the state of the union address the state of the union address for me was exciting because i felt as a newcomer to congress that we had a president that was willing to stand up to the plate and deal with the budget deficit you know what happened when he went out to sell this plan to people not the republicans but the people they said cut spending first what did he do he abandoned his sales pitch now what happens we have democrats by the droves running to the floor of the house to save the presidents plan when he himself is not selling when he himself is not out advertising when he himself is letting democrats fall on the sword people ask me gridlock in congress jim how do you get around gridlock in congress folks gridlock is over gridlock is over on this side we cannot stand in the way of their plan how many do they have they have more than 218 dont they if they dont maybe the gridlock is on their side of the aisle and maybe they have to face up to that fact not on the republican side of course we are not going to vote for it are you crazy we are not going to drive people out of work but if you want to you provide the votes you pass the presidents plan he is not calling republicans he has not called me he has not asked me to support the plan he has not asked me how it affects farmers in iowa they say be specific we have got kasich we even have two amendments that we are willing to introduce this week if they will let us will they let us have an open rule people out there watching they say what is an open rule that doesnt make any sense that is procedural an open rule means we get to debate this we get to offer our amendments and we get to offer our specifics we will see if they let us put your money where your mouth is so to speak i think what we have to do is face up to the reality of what this plan is really going to mean i think it is probably put best in the words of president clintons barber president clintons barber probably would say clinton is hair today and gone tomorrow what is most disturbing about the past 4 months is that the way of doing business in the house of representatives has not changed my constituents tell me they are willing to sacrifice to reduce the federal budget deficit they have said repeatedly they are willing to step up to the plate and take their fair share of the hits to fight the red ink spending in washington but thars not what has happened first rural america took its share of hits when agricultural programs were cut 2 9 billion but the hits didnt end there they were also informed that in addition to 2 9 billion in cuts for agriculture they would get hit with a btu tax that will cost farmers between 1 000 and 4 000 per year and they will get hit again with a barge tax that is expected to increase the cost of each bushel of corn between 5 and 10 cents but the hits dont just end there either the money resulting from the cuts in farm programs and increased taxes will not go to the 4 trillion debt hanging over our heads instead congress has decided that any savings resulting from farm program cuts and tax increases will go to fund new federal programs after the house of representatives votes on the budget reconciliation package this week and the dust settles it is rural america that will carry the burden of increased taxes rural america no doubt

no republicans were in support of the budget resolution that passed this house earlier this year however the democrats have committed themselves to certain levels of budgetary discipline this number for fiscal year 1995 is precisely the number that was included in that budget presentation what are we told in the letter that came out from the chairman of the committee on science space and

mining regulation when the cumbersome federal review and appeals process is ineffective states such as utah through state regulatory agencies and boards have often enforced permit and reclamation

activities although federal regulation has not required financial assurance for reclamation of small five acres or less mining and exploration operations some states have enacted state statutory

construed as authorizing the secretary to delegate to the state his duty to approve land use plans on federal lands to designate certain federal lands as unsuitable for mining pursuant to section 204 of this act or to regulate other activities taking place on federal lands the secretary shall not enter into a cooperative agreement with any state under this section until after notice in the federal

brac process was designed to bypass the politics that prevented congress from closing a single domestic base during the 70s and the late 80s we could learn a lesson from the brac process since parochial interests have blocked base closure in the past and still block spending cuts today i personally believe that a brac type procedure should be established to reduce spending and eliminate the deficit however there is no political gridlock when it comes to closing foreign bases the pentagon has closed bases abroad with little or no rumblings in congress since 1990 brac has approved the closure or realignment of approximately 60 major facilities in the united states during that same time frame we have closed approximately 700 installations abroad this is according to information

visit every major foreign base on that list these visits also include input from community leaders as to why their bases should not be closed the fourth reason i am opposed to this amendment as that if we incorporate foreign base closures into the domestic process that would mean as i mentioned meetings with community leaders as the process operates now communities in the united states can make a case for having their bases removed from the closure listand some are successful communities abroad cannot do this by voting for this amendment congress could be providing a forum where foreign

one of the most brutal assaults on innocent civilians in this hemisphere a boatload of 72 cuban refugees was sunk on july 13 when cuban government ships rammed their vessel and fired highpressure water cannons at them shortly after it happened i remember discussing this with the gentleman from new jersey the gentleman from florida and the gentlewoman from florida who could not believe there was such lack of reporting of this horrific incident in the american press and indeed the world press one would really wonder as to why there would be an attempt to try to hush this up there was a report in the miami herald which said 7 miles from shore the boat was met by cuban firefighting vessels and reports indicated that people were sent flying overboard and slamming against walls and railings as powerful hoses shot their water against the tugboat in the end more than 30 people died before the survivors were rescued 1 month mr castro kills dozens of refugees escaping his authoritarian government and the next month he sends thousands of boat people on a dangerous voyage to the shores of the united states these incidents should dispel any notion that castro has any sense of decency or any ounce of compassion for his people to those who would say that we ought to normalize relations with this brutal stalinist regime i would say that not until the political pluralism comes to cuba should we even think about it it is really amazing to me that the governments of eastern europe the communist governments of eastern europe have long ago fallen by the wayside there are very very few stalinist repressionist regimes in the world but castro is still there the aging dictator is still there in havana it seems to me he has to go and get out of the way and let democracy return to cuba i am therefore proud to add my voice in support of h con res 279 which condemns cuba for the killings of july 13 and i would like to once again thank my friend and colleague

massachusetts i understand the spirit of the gentlemans amendment we have supported the gentleman i think on the national endowment for democracy and some of the other spending cuts because we did not see a direct correlation on american lives and how it would affect this country but let me tell the gentleman why i oppose his amendment more through a personal view and a personal inference and using the intelligence community first of all president clinton supports the permanent select committee on intelligence and no cuts in it for a very good reason and where the president is wrong we will sure lambaste him on this side but where he is good we need to praise president clinton i support his position in this but there are no points for second place when we are dealing with the lives of our young american fighting men and women we are not competing for six gold medals let me tell members about some specific examples in north vietnam there was a place called hourglass over the red river valley the intelligence that we had is that the active sa2 sam sites were down we went in over an overcast and we lost four aircraft in one afternoon because the intelligence was wrong let me give another specific example there was a place called operation proud deep in which we had 3 days to strike the supplies over north vietnam our intel told us that most of those sam sites had not been supplied madam chairman we lost 37 aircraft in 3 days many of my very close friends because of faulty intelligence there was another strike called protective reaction strikes in which we were to strike the enemy in north vietnam there also because of a lack of knowledge of the surfacetoair missile sites myself was fired at about 37 sa2 surfacetoair missiles fired in pairs the intel said that the migs were operating against our b52s which was correct but with the lack of knowledge of the sam sites we went in and we lost american lives because of faulty intel on that the bekaa valley in the middle east we had the israelis who lost zero aircraft in the bekaa valley where the opposition lost over 400 aircraft because of good intelligence in 1973 while flying over mount hermone the intelligence that we had in the middle east saved many many lives and would today the president is asking our american pilots men and women to fly in bosnia we have the technology to tell what real targets are since world war i we have gone into targets and they have had false targets and if we could go in and strike the real targets that means that we do not have to go back a second and a third time which means survivability and less time of exposure over hostile environment for our pilots in top gun i was an instructor where we taught pincer tactics as a direct result of our satellites and monitoring enemy tactics and formations that they would fly against american pilots and our allies we fly today those tactics at navy fighter weapons school at the air force aggressor squadrons and others and what that is is a direct result and if we get into a conflict in bosnia serbia libya or wherever it happens to be we will have the edge on whatever those potential enemies are our priorities should be with the young men and women that we ask to serve there is a favorite saying those who fight for life madam chairman have a special flavor for life that the protected will never know on 10 may 1972 i was shot down with an sa2 missile over north vietnam one month ago i met the soviet scientist who is now one of my voters and gives me campaign money that developed the sa2 missile that shot me down those scientists are all over the world i have no doubt that libya and many of our enemies have some of those same scientists with 217 billion in cuts in our defense budget is it any wonder that we need more intelligence this member has a personal vendetta or maybe not a vendetta but a personal gripe against the cia i would love to cut them but not when it is going to cost the lives of men and women in our armed services it is like the movie critters where in the soviet union you dissolve one and that one becomes 100 there is an additional need for the cia and our intelligence community and the information tools that we get to determine what the factors are in the air order of battle and land battles that we could face in the future madam chairman this is an

the floor for demonstration this should never happen if supporters were really interested in change they would go the route of a constitutional amendment someone mentioned the fact that wyoming was
