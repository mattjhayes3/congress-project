one of the worlds most forceful opponents of imperialism and colonialism for over 25 years the peoples republic of china has tried systematically and brutally to crush the tibetan people in particular their nationalism and religion that policy has failed but since 1983 the peoples republic of china has launched and implemented a plan to flood tibet with chinese settlers in order to reduce the tibetan to an insignificant minority in their own country that is clearly the purpose of chinas final solution to destroy the tibetans as a people as a nation while preserving the more unusual aspects of tibetan culture as a tourist attraction drawing foreign exchange this policy can be stopped when over 90 of you signed a letter to the president of china 2 years ago the chinese where made to abandon their policy of destroying the religion and culture of the people of tibet by brutal force chinas leaders today are highly sensitive about international concern about tibet the chinese are responsive to international pressure because of their desire to create a good image abroad an image of a country governed by the rule of law and respect for human rights chinas desire for high technology and its need for tourismwhich provides the foreign exchange indispensable to her modernization campaignare perhaps the most important causes for chinas responsiveness with our help the tibetan people can be saved before the effect of chinas genocidal policies will have become irreversible why should we be interested in what happens on the roof of the world you should be interested in what happens for at least four important reasons first we should express the moral outrage that we all feel in the face of willful infliction of suffering and the deliberate destruction of an entire people in short a valuable part of our very humanity is at stake today china is implementing a massive transfer of chinese into tibet to drown the tibetan people in a sea of chinese a respected international lawyer recently shared his observations about his trip earlier this year to tibet with me he said that i have never felt so depressed in my life is an almost grotesque understatement i had never before personally witnessed felt the systematic destruction of a people heard the silent cries of an entire generation that spent the greatest part of its ife in prison labor camps political reeducation centers i had never felt the oppressiveness of a military occupation the fear of ones own words spoken in whispers it was simply heart wrenching he went on explaining an encounter with one of the few tibetans serving in the government in tibet a middleaged man who after his release from prison has been given a high position in tibet by the chinese pushed a little note into my pocket while we drank tea in loaded silence in a small living room in the backstreets of lhasa i could hear the silence despite a laughter in the adjoining room the note said i am so sorry i cannot talk openly now for there are progressive comrades in this house we thank you for your help in our cause do not be deceived by the talk of liberalization and religious freedom it is not real there is no freedom please tell his holiness the dalai lama we live in a large burning hole of fire please help our dalai lama to rescue us second we should be interested in the tibetan issue also for the legal reasons because the tibetan struggle is what america stands for the struggle of a people to regain the freedom and independence that is rightfully theirs tibet is an independent state under foreign occupationillegal occupation to be precisejust as is the case in afghanistan communist china has justified its occupation on two grounds only that tibet has always been an integral part of china that tibetans were economically socially and technologically backward but tibet was never a part of china and it was fully independent when 80 000 chinese troops launched the invasion in 1949 the military attack was blatant aggression and it was strongly denounced as such by the free worldincluding the united states the issue has been successfully confused by repetitions of chinese propaganda but a serious study of tibets status makes the point selfevident tibets backwardness of course is irrelevant it is true that tibet was materially backward but how could this ever justify invasion occupation and genocide alarmingly tibet is the largest territory to have been robbed of its sovereignty since world war i1 it is a sad irony that tibet was occupied and turned into a chinese colony in the age of decolonization when so many other countries and people had regained their independence third the tibetan issue is a human rights issue the tibetan peoples fundamental rights have been trampled on for decades now 1 2 million tibetans lost their lives and at least as many lingered n prisons or labor camps as a result of the occupation solzhenitzyn called the chinese regime in tibet the most brutal communist regime in the world and the international commission of jurists concluded after an investigation that china was guilty of genocide today tibetans have no political rights at all in their countrys affairs not even economic agricultural or educational affairs behind todays facade of religious freedom the very tibet identity is being wounded more deeply than the previous overt persecution could do the united nations general assembly passed 3 resolutions strongly supported by the united states urging the peoples republic of china to put an end to the violations of fundamental human rights and freedoms in tibet and calling for the exercise of the tibetan peoples right to selfdetermination this has been the unitedstates position in the past it should be our position today fourth but you do not even have to be interested in the tibetan cause or support it to be interested in what happens in tibet today there are important geopolitical reasons why you should be interested what do we know about what happens on the vast tibetan plateau do we realize the importance of this to the chinese how many people are aware for example that one of the six charges used to depose of hu yaobang in december of last year was his effort to initiate policies to alleviate the strife suffered by the tibetans in their own country how many papers pointed out that chinas one countrytwo systems idea for hong kong and taiwan is not novel but a repetition of chinas unified front 1951 agreement for the peaceful liberation of tibet imposed on the tibetan government there is a great misconception of the relevance of tibet in chinas policies including her foreign policy that alone is reason to be interested in what happens in tibet let me give you another example how much do we read in the paper about sinoindian relations and when we do does tibet feature prominently in those articles yet sinotibetan relations are of necessity bound to the whole issue of tibet so are the imminent seasonal border conflicts again troops are facing each other on the indotibetan border last summer many men died on both sides in a conflict that was hardly reported this summer you can expect even more serious fighting in tibet chinese are telling tibetans to be prepared for a conflict watching what happens in tibet is important to understand what happens in china we forget that tibet is a vast country onefourth the surface area of the peoples republic of china it is the size of india or saudi arabia it is equal in size to onethird the united states or the size of western europe minus scandinavia tibet is located in asias strategic heart and at one time separated the continents great powers this is precisely why asias empires went to great pains to keep each other out of tibet in order to preserve what was considered to be a crucial buffer statea switzerland of asia as it wereessential to peace and stability in asia it is tibets strategic location that was chinas principal reason for invading the country the invasion has made china a neighbor of india afghanistan pakistan nepal and other south asian states it would otherwise be thousands of miles away from what can we do to help i believe that the basis not just for helping the tibetan people but for helping the united states in shaping its foreign policy with respect to asia should be to recognize the situation for what it is genocidal colonialism we can help tibetans by exposing what china is really doing in tibet it has launched an allout offensive to eliminate the tibetans as a people and to secure a dominant position in the area the eventual presence of 10 million or 20 million chinese on the indian subcontinents border will change the demographic and political map of the region and is certain to heighten tension in the area adding one more focus of conflict in the world the tibetan people have suffered too much we helped the tibetans in the past and i believe that now is the time to renew our commitment to these noble people we turned our backs on tibet once and our nation and the tibetans have paid dearly the human rights abuses in tibet and the chinese population transfer must stop china is very sensitive to this issue and the united states can influence a change in the many tragedies that plague tibet accordingly i urge you my honorable colleagues to adopt this amendment to h r 1777"], [0.40264004468917847, 0.5973599553108215, 1, "i thank the gentleman for bis kind and gracious words during the time he spoke and for yielding me this time i wish to say

given the preliminary first the fhas home mortgage insuring pro research on the effectiveness of vouchers grams will become permanent no more fits congress should be extremely cautious about and

families assisted pay more than 30 percentof their income for rent a substantial percentage pay an unbearable 40 to 50 percent of their income and because of the lack of a rent reasonableness test in the voucher program the amount of subsidy actually paid by the federal government under the voucher program ishigher than the amount under the section 8 certificate program for the same amount of money over the same period of time we could house more families paying 30 percent of their income for rent under the section 8 certificate program than under the voucher program over 1 years ago the housing and community development subcommittee began the first congressional investigation of the potential loss of over 1 million units presently available and affordable to low and moderate income tenants as sections 236 and 221 d 3 federally insured and subsidized rental housing projects reach their 20 year anniversary and owners consider repaying the mortgages and terminating rent and occupancy requirements faced with the spectre of this loss which is even more devastating because of the failure over the past 7 years to maintain a healthy assisted housing production program this conference report contains an interim solution the owners of housing insured under the national housing act can neither prepay their mortages or in any way change the status or the terms of the regulatory agreement without the secretary of hud approving a plan of action which must be designed to preserve as much low and moderate income housing as possible this conference report is also a tribute to the survival of the rural housing programs of the farmers home administration congress has rejected the administrations attempt to eliminate this key source of homeowner loans for lower income families in rural areas and has created a modest loan guarantee program for families whose income does not exceed 115 percent of rural median incomes whose access to financing is extremely limited particularly in the case of firsttime home buyers the conference report also addresses the critical problem of the loss of affordable section 515 rental housing units for low income families through a program of incentives and refinancing owners of these projects are encouraged to keep these projects in the rural low income inventory for another 20 years or to turn them over to local nonprofit or public agencies without penalty the conference report extends the cbdg program for 2 more years and sharpens the focus of that program the amount of funds thatmust principally benefit low and moderate income families is increased from 50 to60 percent while this change affects the total expenditure in a state or entitlement community up to a 3year period it has not changed the low and moderateincome threshold that individual projects must meet the conference report also strengthens citizen participation requirements and assures that low and moder ateincome families that are displaced from their homes as a result of cdbg or udag funded activities will be compensated fairly finally the conference report establishes a program of nehemiah homeownership grants designed to assist nonprofit organizations to help families whose incomes generally are no higher than the area median to purchase homes that are concentrated in lower income neighborhoods this neighborhood revitalization effort is modeled after a very successful program initiated in brooklyn ny and was the subject of hearings held by the housing subcommittee in 1984 given the reasonableness of the authorization levels the inclusion of a number of reforms urged by our republican colleagues to the public housing program the rural homeownership loan guarantee program the section 202 handicapped program the enterprise zone program and the permanent authority provided for the fha insuring programs i urge my colleagues support for the passage of this conference report the text of the statement of managers contains an error on page 201 which i intend to clarify as the conference report provides under section 241 the 120day period for which an offer to sell to a nonprofit organization and public agency is required can only occur if funding is available for purposes of carrying out a transfer under section 502 c 5 a as amended i want to clarify that a provision contained in section 503 b of title v subtitle a community and neighborhood development and preservation pertaining to the classification of urban counties page 116 of house report 100426 is incorrect the correct language should be i has a combined population in excess of 175 000 has more than 50 percent of the housing units of the area unsewered and has an aquifer that was designated before march 1 1987 a sole source aquifer by the environmental protection agency rather than what was inadvertently printed on page 116 i will state that the committee will make this change in the next legislative vehicle going

committee on education and labor the amendments to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 made by subtitle a represent a bipartism approach to solving the serious problems facing our pension system in the areas of plan termination and funding in addition a substantial increase in the annual permium paid by singleemployer plans to the pension benefit guaranty corporation is authorized the amendments made by subtitle b are designed to further national retirement income policy by providing for pension portability and greater likelihood that money saved for retirement will be used for that purpose subtitles a and b are comprehensive packages of legislative change in most instances the changes affect matters within the sole jurisdiction of the committee on education and labor in certain other instances the changes affect matters within the shared jurisdictions of the committee on education and labor and the committee on ways and means in a few instances the changes affect tax matter within the sole jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means in its amendments contained in title x and xi of the bill the committee on ways and means has adopted similar legislative changes most of which affect matters within the sole jurisdication of that committee some affecting matters which are within the sole jurisdication of the committee on education and labor and some within the shared jurisdication of our committees prior to the actions of either committee the committees informally agreed that the serious problems facing the pension system needed comprehensive and integrated solutions because of the complexity of the issues involved and the need to carefully coordinate the labor and tax provisions of erisa the committees agreed that notwithstanding the jurisdictional prerogatives of our two committees each would develop its own package of legislative changes both packages have been included in the bill before us and will move forward to conference our primary goals in adoptingthis strategy were two to enable the conferees to have the benefit of broader approaches to these problems than would otherwise be the case if the normal jurisdictional procedures were followed and to avoid further complicating an already difficult budget process although the legislative proposals adopted by the committee on education and labor and the committee on ways and means are different we share the common goal of improving the benefit security of all workers and the financial condition of the pbgc i am confident that we can work out our differences amicably and quickly in conference and that the cooperative spirit with which we have approached these issues thus far will continue to prevail a brief summary of the major features of title iii follows"], [0.41179758310317993, 0.5882024168968201, 1, "i rise today to express my strong support for h r 3058 the labor health and human services and education appropriations bill for fiscal year 1988 my statement is entitled a committee responds this year this title is appropriate and fitting the subcommittee on labor health and human services and education held hearings for 4 months this year we heard from a broad spectrum of witnesses including those from the administration and numerous interest groups unlike other years many interest groups joined forces and pushed for their priorities this strategy was not only effective but sensible it has become clear to the members of the subcommittee and i presume to congress and the american people that there are programs that are in desperate need of a substantial increase in federal funding a few years ago there was a lot of publicity concerning the findings included in a nation at risk the administration publicly stated that it shared the concerns of our nations educators over the state of education however in its 1988 budget the administration didnt address those concerns the congress both the house and senate did put its money in the right place the conference agreement on the budget for fiscal year 1988 recognizes the domestic needs of this country without ignoring our national defense the budget conference agreement provided the appropriations committee with the necessary flexibility to address several problems and provide additional federal funding to key programs several of which i will address in my remarks this year the debate over education funding has centered around providing assistance to atrisk children these are the children who lag behind their classmates on standardized tests and who have not realized the benefits of our educational system many of these children are minorities some are handicapped some come from broken homes and they come from both urban and rural communities these children are however part of our future for our society to be all that it can be they must become productive and successful members of it we will have nice offices with no one to staff them well have a huge military with no one to operate the weapons and well have empty college dormitories because only a small fraction of our population will be ready or able to take part in higher education the labor health and human services subcommittee understands the problem facing at risk children in this nation and what needs to be done to insure these children the opportunity to get on the right track h r 3058 provides funds for highly successful and cost effective federal programs for our nations childrenprograms such as head start chapter 1 compensatory education maternal and child health block grant job corps and many others in this bill we have provided a 650 million increase for the chapter 1 program an effective program which can do a lot to address the problems of at risk children in relative terms this is a small step in recouping the damage that has been wrought since 1980 the proposed 1988 funding level for chapter 1 as adjusted for inflation is still approximately 13 5 percent less than it was in fiscal year 1980 presently only 40 to 45 percent of the 8 9 million eligible students are served by this program the increase provided for in this bill will allow the chapter 1 to increase its participation by 15 percent or 715 000 students i am also proud to note that the committee provided a 125 4 million increase for the head start program programs such as head start which are referred to as early intervention programs have been proven time and time again that they are costeffective programs early childhood education is a critical investment head start works hand in hand with the chapter 1 program insufficient funds have limited head start participation to only 16 percent of the eligible children every eligible child should have the benefit of a head start experience we have made a big step in the right direction another subject that id like to mention is the subject of aids this is another area where the committee and the congress heard the facts and responded the committee heard testimony from all sources that the federal aids research and education effort should be expanded greatly several institute directrors discussed the need to expand clinical trials on aids increased funds will also go to expand the effort to develop a vaccine for aids and expansion of efforts to develop drugs for treatment of aids and to test those drugs it became clear from testimony we received that we had to try for a new balance between our search for cures or vaccines with efforts to prevent and control the spread of aids and until such time as we find a cure funds must be provided to expand education and prevention efforts particularly those affecting the minority and iv drug using communities this bill provides 945 million for aids research and education 315 6 million of this increase can be associated with various information and education activities throughout the public health service including 95 8 million for testing and counseling the overall increase if 466 2 million over 1987 the presidents revised budget request requested 766 million just 5 years ago we provided 5 5 million for research the committee report points out in clear and specific terms the danger we face with this disease the committee has also directed that administrative steps be taken to increase the amount of scientific expertise available to the national institutes of health the alcohol drug abuse and mental health administration and the centers for disease control id like to remind the members of the house that this subcommittee conducted hearings for 4 months and had a markup which lasted 111 2 hours over 2 days we worked hard to fashion a bill that meets the domestic needs of this country like all of the members of the subcommittee i

we passed the bill in 1986 we did grant an exemption to three different companies two later did not qualify one did it was not our intent to exclude other companies or to show favoritism or to grant anybody a loophole when we examined it by personal inspection last year w thought the fair thing would be to extend it to two other companies there are a total of approximately five now that would be eligible for this temporary exemption they ought to be granted it the amount of ethanol compared with the productive capacity in this country is so small that we ought not to hesitate a minute to

of those reductions but i do not think that this is the way to solve that problem and even if this amendment were to be adopted most of the cuts the gentleman referred to to the domestic programs would take place anyway what would the gentlemans amendment mean for our ability to provide vitally important assistance to a whole slew of strategically important countries around the world the amendment before the members offered by the gentleman from ohio would have the effect of cutting by 20 percent the level of economic security assistance provided for in this bill but in reality the actual reductions it would require among those countries to which it would be applied would be substantially greater the reason for that is that the committee bill earmarks the esf assistance contained in the legislation for israel egypt and the philippines consequently the cuts called for in this amendment would not apply to any of those countries they would have to be applied to the rest of the countries which receive esf assistance whose funds are not earmarked when this cut of roughly 800 million is applied to the countries that are not protected it would result in a cut of close to twothirds in the overall level of esf assistance to those other countries what countries are we talking about we are talking about for example turkey which is the key to the viability of the southern flank of nato a nation which has the largest land border of any country in the atlantic alliance with the soviet union we are talking about substantial cuts in the level of our assistance to spain

here and tapdance now that is not what the founding fathers and founding mothers thought about they said we are three independent bodies and we are to come here and exercise our judgment now no 1 we are being told that this is not political however the president of the united states was advised by his secretary of defense his national security adviser the joint chiefs and the ranking republican member in the senate to please sign the bill on the other side he was advised by george bush not to no 2 the president says in his veto message one of the reasons he is so offended by this bill is the arms control provisions which we have done before but he is so offended by that because he thinks it takes power away from him and we should be speaking with one voice to the soviet union the reason i think that is totally undercut is at the time the president is vetoing this message his own secretary of defense is in the soviet union he is undercutting his own secretary of defense at a time when he is over there negotiating the poor man must feel a little silly being over there having said sign it left town and boom this is what happens now we are supposed to over here in the congress go one

the most massive pentagon scandal we have ever seen there are many of us who have been working very hard under chairman aspin having all sorts of hearings about this scandal we found all sorts of things that maybe we need to do to this bill that we did not know about when we first had it making the inspector general more independent we probably need whistleblower protection for the different contract employees who have no protection at all maybe we would have found out about this scandal much earlier had that happened all those things are there we would be totally remiss to throw away those months of hearings and what we have been focusing on since we passed that bill we do not quit when this bill is passed our chairman is a real taskmaster he has been driving us trying to find out what has been going on very important i think it is also important to point out that we have had all sorts of things happening in the persian gulf now people on this side had to go to convince the defense department on the pay issue that the persian gulf was indeed a dangerous area and people should get danger pay so this side has been very worried about the morale of our soldiers and i find it very offensive when the other side says we are playing games with that we are not we did get danger pay for people in the persian gulf area as they should have it with our work i think all of those

impeachment and in which specific violations of our laws as well as constitutional provisions clearly indicate that the congress has an overriding responsibility and had best confront this problem sooner rather than later there is no question about the fact that the president is headed in an undeviating way into direct military intervention with our troops in central america what we have had thus far has been fragmentary participation in the month of may in less than a month and a week he will introduce over 50 000 soldiers just from our department of the army into honduras for supposedly training exercises which training exercises were inaugurated at the same time and coincidentally with his naming of a socalled bipartisan commission on central america while he announced the formation of the commission he simultaneously announced the greatest concentration of military strength in the history of this region of the world with a constant presence of the sea on both sides of the isthmus there on the pacific on the caribbean and over the air and on the land involving at no time less than 30 000 of our military a total of better than 17 have died in this endeavor there was very little notice it was really never reported but nevertheless they did what is inexorable is the presidents undeviating intentiontime is running out on himto intervene if i would hazard any kind of guess i would say by the month of june we will see the headlines and then of course the rest is history but at this point the very fact that the congress has abdicated its traditional role as set forth in the constitution in article i and it is a good reason why those who wrote the constitution and who exactly 200 years ago were engaged in that process at this time in the month of march that they devised that article i would be the policymaking body of the country the congress of the united states and hesitated long before they could reach an agreement as to the creation and establishment of such an office as we call the presidency in fact the words usually used were chief magistrate it was about this time of the year that john adams then minister to london from our fledgling nation concerned very much by the fact that this great historical and auspicious occasion on the attempt on the part of delegates from the various states and colonies to forge an instrument as a result of the first 10 years of rather failed nationhood government with the first and second continental congresses who fought the revolutionary war and then the articles of confederation i think we should note that during the first 10 years of our nationhood there was not any such thing as the office of a president or an executive chief because there was good reason for that they feared what the lessons of history clearly and demonstrably have shown all along john adams so fearful as he was a very very careful scholar deep researcher into the history of the experiences of mankind with government and particularly that very precious thing that we call selfgovernment which was a radical revolutionary concept the world was governed by kings or potentates who said that their sovereignty that is their source of power was from god well you could not go any higher than that or you had czars or you had oligarchies the select chosen few the idea that the people would be the source of power all source of power all sovereignty emanating from the people was just something that was not considered at all short of being highly revolutionary and radical thus the birth of our american revolutionary effort john adams then wrote to the various delegates particularly those who were here like james madison and wilson and mason pointing out that the only thing history showed was that where you had a separation of powers you had success in the foundations and in the formulations of peoples governments or democracies that where you had any kind of concentration of sovereignty in any one of these three basic organs in mankinds struggle to erect governments that you would not have freedom that you would eventually have tyranny and oppression so he gave us examples the experience of rome at the time that the republic was fading and men such as cicero were arguing hard and explaining why they had to have this separation of powers and fighting against what eventually became concentrated in the caesars of rome so today we live at a time when that dilemma confronts us as never before in our history during the period known as the nixon administration period and the very very cataclysmic things that followed for the first time in the history of our republic an unelected president two unelected vice presidents i am sure that those who wrote the constitution must have turned over over at least 50 times in their graves because this is exactly what it was they feared the most that was the result of the 25th amendment which i voted against and spoke against on this house floor i was one of just about 28 who voted no but the only one who gave his reasons in the record never in my worst fears or nightmares in saying what i said at the time that it was reminiscent the legislation was reminiscent of the old senate intrigue and conspiracy in ancient rome and in more modern times that third republic in france that winston churchill so well described as a maze and a puzzle encased in an enigma and all with intrigue and counterintrigue and power struggles within the ruling classes and of course the downfall of that republic to the german invasion and the overwhelming of the french countryside and french citizens and the occupation and the loss of its freedom to that invasion the facts are that we live in a similar period of time in that eternal vigilance as the price of liberty has no greater immediate and clear significance to us than today it is imperceptible as history shows when free people lose their freedom it is also true that the worst of slaves are corrupted free men we may without even a whimper much less of any threat of external invasion have indeed not only sown the seeds of the destruction of our tremendous government which some of us still retain the faith that demonstrates the ability of the people to govern themselves that in the long run the people know what is best for them that no matter what shortrun apparent victories of the oligarchan few that in the long haul it is the people who know best what is best for them of course democracy is disorderly democracy is not neat democracy is not very careful about the reverential spirit to the mighty and that bothers some particularly those who hunger for power will yield all to satisfy that power but again the history of mankind is as in the case of those great amassers of wealth it is never satiated for some good reason even in our scriptures they say he who loveth silver shall never be satisfied and that is true this is the reason why governments have been created as a means of defending the greatest interest of the greatest number the weak and the vulnerable from the mighty and the ambitious and the bold in the words of james madison how so are we losing that for the very same reason that the current administration and president seem to be mired in an unending tale and one yet to be told of scandalous conduct and illegal conduct we have been condemned before the world tribunal of justice several years ago for gross violations of international law for state terrorismwhich is what it amounts toin the very case of nicaragua which is at the bottom of all of the troubles that a very mixedup president is in today though probably assured very confidently that with the proper circumstances and with the proper conjunction of events by junebecause time is on him he does not have much after this yearhe must have an acceptable and at least for the moment an acceptance on the part of the american people for what will be a very costly venture to the treasure and to the blood of our men in this illbegotten course toward direct military intervention in a meaningful way with 50 000 of our military within shooting distance of what the president considers an enemy and who stands accused and convicted before world law of using illegal and unjust means to do what to overthrow a government that he sends an ambassador with credentials to recognize as the legal and duly elected government of that people and that nation so we cannot have it both ways we the american people through our representatives must either speak out or forever abdicate at a critical junction when it is absolutely necessary that these coordinate coequal independent separate branches of the government rise to the occasion for the

laws the report was compiled by arthur young inc one of the nations largest and most reliable accounting firms in comparing the tax policies of the united states with those of the netherlands japan and germany the disadvantage was quite apparent this competitive disadvantage in world markets is present today due to enacted federal tax policy over the past 20 years including the 1986 tax reform act the primary reason this has occurred is due to the fact that many other countries have adopted tax policies that to varying degrees encourage firms to do business overseas essentially the united states has adopted exactly the opposite policy it is no wonder we are experiencing record trade deficits with a tax policy that is complex vague and discouraging to multinational companies the simple fact is that congress has failed miserably when it comes to encouraging business to engage in the international market instead congress prefers the easier route of protectionism we must aggressively seek to change the tax structure so that it is fair and equitable to do business overseas which will then in turn reduce our trade deficits though his competitive disadvantage has been accumulating over several years of federal tax policy arthur young inc has pointed out three very obvious disadvantages of the unitedstates multinational companies first when exemptions or deferrals foreign tax credits and tax treaties are taken into account the unitedstates multinationals most often are at the highest end of the tax rate scale on foreign operations compared to other countries even though the 1986 tax reform act lowered the nominal corporate tax rate many unitedstates companies will face increased tax liability on foreign source income second the united states has no treaty in which it agrees to spare unitedstates tax on income that could have been but was not taxed by a lesser developed country many other countries have such a tax sparing treaty the main effect of this absent treaty is that it hinders the unitedstates ability to access the low cost labor and raw materials of third world countries in a way that would enable these companies to compete equally in world trade third the third reason that puts the unitedstates multinational companies at a competitive disadvantage is the extent to which the present federal tax treaties modify the two above reasons this study has made me aware of a very serious problem with our international trade tax system in the coming weeks i plan to solicit the views of top multinational corporations in america on how to address this situation only then can we begin to answer the comfebruar~y 25 1988 cor plex questions facing our international trade problems"], [0.5771075487136841, 0.5771075487136841, 0, "i want to talk today on the american crisis in selfgovernment there are actually two crises one involves the presidency and the other involves the unitedstates house of representatives the crisis in the house can be represented by a single number 98 5 98 5 is the percent of incumbents who were reelected in 1986 that is a real crisis because the founding fathers intended for elections to be fair to be honest and to involve the process of truly challenging whether or not the incumbent should be rehired when only 1 5 percent of the incumbents are defeated we or anyone with common sense know automatically that in fact we have a crisis in the system because it is not renewing itself the founding fathers debated in the constitutional convention whether we should have elections every 6 months or every 2 years it was a very long debate running almost a month in which they argued for 6month elections because they really believed that while they should elect the senate and the white house for a long period of time the one branch of congress should be permanently scared yet over a long period of time in a trend which began in the 1890s and which accelerated dramatically after 1974 we have seen the building up of professional politicians abuse until today the incumbent is so invulnerable that it is a major crisis in the system it is literally true that 1988 will be the first year in which the people of mexico will have had a greater likelihood of defeating incumbents than the people of the united states that is an historic moment a moment in which literally in elections for the unitedstates house of representatives you are less likely to affect the balance of power with your vote than you would in elections in mexico and indeed if gorbachevs glasnost succeeds you will be less likely to affect the balance of power in the unitedstates house than you would in the soviet central parliament that they are inventing that sounds like hyperbole that sounds like rhetoric but it is literally and statistically true that in 1986 98 5 percent of the incumbents were reelected that is a fundamental subversion of the founding fathers constitutional intent of having fair elections in which the challenger had a fair opportunity to defeat the incumbent and in which the voter had a fair choice the crisis in the house has led to a much much more leftwing policy than the american people believe in the fact is that the average american is part of a centerright majority and that again and again from 1968 to the present the average american has voted against leftwing candidates for president hubert humphrey got 43 percent of the vote george mcgovern got 38 percent jimmy carter beat all the liberals in 1976 when he was perceived as a southern baptist populist and in 1980 jimmy carter beat edward kennedy and then was defeated then in 1984 walter mondale proudly stood up in san francisco and said i really am a liberal and the country said yes you are and he got 41 percent of the vote so at the presidential level we have had absolute evidence for a generation that leftwing policies do not get very much support that has led however to the second crisis in our system and that is the fact that selfgovernment requires honesty and openness and requires some minimum level of candor to work that is the voter has to have the ability by election day to have some reasonable understanding of what the politician who is running for office stands for if the politician can get away with a very high level of disinformation or just plain aishonesty then the voters are not really sure what they are voting for as i reported in two previous special orders we now have a systems crisis in which one of the two major parties the democratic party having concluded after 20 years of presidential election results that it is simply n t possible to run an honest liberal and win has given up on the word honesty so what we now have is a party systematically running a deceptive campaign this was best illustrated recently in a threepage article by fred barnes in the new republic but it emerges again in the current miniflap over governor dukakis health records let me say for the record that i think that it is governor dukakis personal choice whether or not he releases his health records i think he has every right as an individual citizen to not release his health records and i think there is no automatic requirement that you release your records just in order to run for the presidency i do think there is a legitimate concern on the part of the american people that they have a pretty good knowledge that the person they put next to the nuclear button the person who in the oval office could start a nuclear war be a relatively healthy and calm and rational person and i think there are profound reasons for that that starting with the rise of the nuclear age beginning with truman and eisenhower there has been a growing tendency to expect presidents to be remarkably candid many people my age will remember lyndon johnson showing off his scars others a little older will remember eisenhowers heart attacks there has been a remarkable pattern of openness about presidential health because the presidency is the one institution that could start a nuclear war but i do not object to governor dukakis having a right to privacy he is an american citizen and even though he is running for the presidency he has every right to remain private i think there is an easy simple compromise that he could follow and that would be to allow two or three nationally respected doctors to review his health records maintaining the privacy but nonetheless having neutral parties not his mutual doctor and friend for 17 years tell us how healthy he is but the point i want to make goes a bit deeper it goes to the issue of deception not the issue of health governor dukakis has been running around the country saying that he is going to be the ethics president that in his administration ethics is going to be in the oval office he made the promise that there will be no secrets from the american people in the dukakis administration now i do think he has an obligation if he is going to be honest to withdraw that promise he has every right to keep his health records private to keep them secret as long as he admits there are times he is going to be secret i am frankly willing to have a man run for president who says yes there are some secrets you wont learn yes if we do certain things in international affairs and we have to keep them secret to protect our allies you wont learn them i am willing to have a man who says yes there are times when the lives of american agents may be at stake and you wont learn them that is perfectly fine what i find impossible in this age of television is to have a candidate like governor dukakis who says i promise you there will be no secrets and then 3 days later he says oh by the way there are a few secrets you are not allowed to look at please dont pay attention to those 1l16448 now which is it and i think mike dukakis has to come clean with the rest of us he has to either say yes im running an ethics campaign im going to have ethics in the oval office and here are my health records or he has to say no there are times im going to keep a few secrets this is one of them and by the way i take back all that stuff i said earlier now i raise this because this is only the latest in a long series of deceptive efforts if my colleagues will notice in the democratic platform in atlanta they worked overtime to avoid the word liberal because they figured out that liberal is not a good word they worked overtime to avoid talking about tax increases because tax increases which is what liberal democrats do to turn people off and they do not get elected also they have worked very very hard to hide the extent of the budget crisis in massachusetts all the time this spring that governor dukakis was parading around the country telling everyone what a great job he was doing in massachusetts in fact the government in massachusetts was disintegrating and the budget was getting worse and worse they now have a crisis which is being papered over only by trying to do radical things like raid the pension funds of the teachers and the government employees raise taxes in a variety of areas borrow a lot of money in effect governor dukakis is trying to hide the deficit in massachusetts until he goas through to the election and again i just want to suggest that it is very difficult in the process of selfgovernment to have an honest campaign in which a candidate like governor dukakis persists in saying things that are simply not candid and simply not forthcoming now let me tie the two together the crisis in the congress and the crisis in the presidential campaign process the unitedstates house because it is no longer representative or accountable because the american people cannot fire the members because as i said earlier 98 5 percent of us get reelected the unitedstates house is now the bastion of leftwing thought in america members of congress who know they do not have to be afraid of the voter because the voters after all are not going to be able to fire them then look for the next source of pleasure and pain and in the house and in the majority party that is the democratic caucus the democratic caucus is somewhere around walter mondale and liberalism with a strong faction to the left of mcgovern a weak faction that is around the sam nunnchuck robb kind of southern moderatism and the base of the party is somewhere between mondale and mcgovern it is on foreign policy an increasingly leftwing majority a majority that on any given day is more likely to understand the nicaraguan communist government than to understand the proamerican nicaraguan freedom fighters a majority that on any given day is more likely to accept the soviet version of arms control than the american governments version a majority that tolerate having the speaker of the house meet in secret on veterans day with a nicaraguan communist dictator the fact is that the american people face a crisis in the process of governing themselves because members of the house cannot be fired for all practical purposes we have members of this house who have been sanctioned by the ethics committee we have some who have been sanctioned for some pretty bizarre things they get reelected we have a few members of the house who get convicted of various things they get reelected we have a process here where we have members who clearly would not under any circumstance be representative of a majority of american voters not only do they get reelected which is perfectly reasonable this house should represent all sorts of groups but they are gradually elevated in power in positions which the vast majority of americans would not understand and the fact is we now have a congress which has in the current congress more ethics cases and more ethics problems than any congress in modern history we have a congress which is out of control which the voters have lost the ability to directly influence and on which members use the tax money given to them to do pretty much what they want it is interesting for example most voters do not realize that one party the democrats have controlled the house for 34 years most voters do not realize that during that time that the democrats have controlled the house we have built up a modern invincible incumbent who has 1 200 000 a cycle in taxpaid opportunities direct mail staff computers offices travel a million two hundred thousand dollars before the challenger gets to raise a dime most voters do not realize that the power of the subcommittee chairmen and committee chairmen is now so great that in most cases it is not political action committees corrupting congressmen it is congressmen like medieval aristocrats demanding tribute in effect demanding the political action committees into contributing we have one member a chairman of a subcommittee who has gotten 350 executives of that particular industry that goes to that subcommittee to give a thousand dollars apiece to that chairman just a straight relationship that says you have power over my business what can i do to make you happy so you wont punish me the result is that the average voters ability to fire their incumbent is less in america today than it was a few weeks ago in the mexican election and i think that is an historic watershed i think that political science and government classes and civics classes are about a generation behind the reality of american politics i think most newspaper television and radio reporters have not looked carefully at the implications of having a congress which is not only out of control that is as it grows harder to defeat incumbents incumbents get more arrogant incumbents get more inclined to do what they want to and incumbents get more willing to impose their views not the views of their district but in addition because the house has been controlled for 34 years by one party the democrats because the house has been controlled for 34 years by a party which has been moving to the left which has moved from sam rayburn if you will to jesse jackson which is now a much more leftwing party than it was 34 years ago because the left wing of that party has an agenda a world view and a willingness to use its muscle to get what it wants you end up as i read earlier with the follov ing message thih is from the president of the unitec states talking about a bill which passed the house which lie vetoed on defense he charged in his veto message of yesterday that the bill would needlessly concede military advantage to the soviets that is that the soviets would get advantages out of the bill that the americans would not get he charged in his veto message it would reward the soviets for their words and not their deeds my colleagues might say to themselves now wait a second on a defense bill written by the committee on armed services passed by the house why would we be conceding military advantage to the soviets why would we be rewarding the soviets well the president went on to say the bill would return us to the practice of rushing to give away our negotiating leverage without receiving a single thing in return from the soviets now the fact is when one looks at that this house is dominated by a leftwing majority of the democratic caucus which believes when possible in unilaterally disarming and unilaterally giving up to the soviets in appeasing the communist dictatorship in the hopes that then it will behave nicely a belief which frank gregorski reported in an essay entitled whatever happened to the democrats in foreign policy in which he reported year by year starting in 1970 with cambodia and vietnam and laos and angola with nicaragua how year by year it is possible for leftwing democrats to always find one more excuse one more explanation one more reason to vote for a weaker america and to accept an aggressive communist world there is a second factor as the congress has gotten further and further away from being policed by the american people by having to worry about reelection by being concerned that they might be fired the special interests inside the congress have grown more and more powerful the president comments on that in his veto message when he says in short the bill trades vitally needed defense muscle for the parochial interests of those in the congress in other words the mandated waste of the congressmen who impose things on the defense department which the defense department does not want and let me say very often ironically it is precisely the leftwing member who is antidefense who then insures that his or her district gets the things they want out of the defense budget because it is impossible in a free society even one in which the biases are so massively in favor of the incumbent with all the advantages i described for an incumbent to go home and say openly i dont care what you believe you cant fire me i have power im going to do what i want to do incumbents learn over time not to be totally candid incumbents learn over time not to necessarily say to the voter exactly what they are doing they learn to use artful words they learn if you will to use deceptive language that is important because it relates directly to what is happening now in the presidential election the fact is when governor dukakis goes to the new jersey beaches and says he would clean them up he does not tell anyone that he is leaving behind in massachusetts 11 beaches that have been closed this year because of the raw sewage that is spilling in when governor dukakis suggests that he is concerned about ocean dumping he does not tell people that it is his friends in the democratic machine in new york city who refuse to stop the ocean dumping he does not comment when he is pledging openness on the fact that he is in fact currently fighting a court order or fighting a court case which would require him to release 200 documents in the new braintree prison scandal when michael dukakis talks about the success that he has had in creating jobsand imagine if you will the tremendous gall of a man who attacks reagan attacks the reagan economy attacks the reagan tax cuts and then says that he brought about the massachusetts miracle as though he was president of massachusetts and it was an independent country the fact is that massachusetts did pretty well in a country which was creating 16 million jobs new hamphsire did better rhode island did better connecticut did better maine did better in fact the truth is that massachusetts has the slowest growth rate of new jobs and new income of any new england state in the last 8 years the truth is that the massachusetts miracle was riding an escalator built by ronald reagan and dukakis was claiming he was carrying the state up on his own back and then not only not crediting ronald reagan but attacking reagan for the very economy which had allowed massachusetts to grow the fact is that according to ralph nader the mental health programs of massachusetts are far below the national average the fact is that the prisons of massachusetts are so bad that a newspaper in massachusetts won a pulitzer prize describing the scandal in michael dukakis prisons the fact is that while michael dukakis claims to be against crime he is a strong defendbr of a program that is reported in an article entitled getting away with murder in the readers digest in july a program which furloughs murderers on the weekends and which in some cases has had murderers out on the street who have then raped tortured and in some cases killed other people again and again when one looks at these things it is discovered that governor dukakis specializes if you will in deceptively packaging the version he wishes us to see so i come back full circle to suggest to my colleagues that there is a direct relationship between the conversation we had on the floor today about whether or not convicted felons should serve in congress about the bronx machine about a may 5 dinner of the bronx machine which brought together all three elements of a democratic party which has less and less concern about honesty at the base of the bronx machine which has been covered in tom wolfs fine novel bonfire of the vanities at that particular dinner thei were indicted city officials sitting at the head table in addition there was a convicted unitedstates congressman who already had a report urging his expulsion sitting at the head table and there was the governor of massachusetts governor dukakis proudly prepared to say he was in favor of ethics even while he sat at a machine dinner with a convicted congressman and indicted city officials let me say finally because i think this fits into that pattern that far from being ashamed of having people there who were convicted felons far from being ashamed about having people there who were indicted city officials that in fact that convicted felon was introduced as one of americas greatest congessmen and did michael dukakis object did he say oh im going to be the ethics president no far from it because he was among his friends now i think that is important because every citizen who cares about the poor every citizen who worries about the south bronx or jersey city every citizen who worries about the homeless in chicago or the difficulties in boston has to recognize that for 40 years the invisible prison in american life has been the big city machines that are corrupt for 40 years we have failed to pay attention to what happens in situations where the big city machines are in fact ripping off both the poor and the taxpaycr for 40 years we who work hard and are honest have been told we have to raise our taxes so the liberal democrats can give more goodies away to their big corrupt city machines i had a ch ace to meet yesterday with gov tom kean of new jersey a courageous crusader a man who went into the jersey city schools because he was concerned about education and discovered to his shock that the machine in jersey city was dumping all of its hack politicians into the administration building of the school system that people who were supposedly being paid to take care of the schoolchildren were in fact taking care of themselves that the administration that was supposed to be taking care of the schools was in fact taking care of its cronies governor kean moved to take over the jersey city schools on the grounds that having a corrupt machine which trapped those children in classrooms where they were not learning was a form of child abuse that the cocaine addict the prostitute and the aids victim of the future was being aided by the corrupt machine of the present he discovered to his shock two reactions the democratic party opposed him bitterly fought for its allies right to rip off the public and rip off those children but the parents did not jump up and say why are you taking over our schools he discovered to his shock from all over new jersey in inner city school after inner city school parents began signing petitions petitions that said come and save our children too now let us go back and look at the problems of new york the problems of the homeless the problems of the schools the problems of aids victims the fact is when you look at boston when you look at chicago when you look at philadelphia when you look at the district of columbia when you look at jersey city and there are others that could be lined up on this list that again and again we have a problem of the corrupt big city democratic party which has no concern about the taxpayer and no concern about the poor which systematically tolerates a level of bureaucratic corruption which makes it almost impossible to truly help those who need help and no one is willing to speak out against it no one is going to stand up and say it has to be changed furthermore you could not get an investigation in the unitedstates house of representatives of a single corrupt big city you could not get the democrats to agree to hold a series of public hearings looking into a single corrupt machine you could not get a single open effort to lay out a standard of honesty because the truth is that the a ugust 4 1988 1t16450 coalition that keeps the democratic party alive is a coalition that relies heavily on not being candid on not being straightforward to use plain old fashioned words on not being honest therefore it was suggested today that we ought to allow a twiceconvicted felon an extra 30 or 40 days we ought to allow a man who pled guilty yesterday it will be suggested to have at least a month or a mouth and a half that is a second member who has pled guilty this week one was convicted this week the other pled guilty he only stole 130 000 from people not a big amount i find it interesting and fascinating that both at the presidential level and at the congresslonal level the basic question of self government the basic question of the requirement of honesty comes back to haunt those who most aggressively attack on that issue comes back to haunt those who have told us for a year lets not protect ollie north lets not protect john poindexter lets not protect the israelis lets not protect americas allies we have to know all the secrets all the members who voted so eagerly for public hearings for television for making sure that week after week we looked at americas secrets in the next few weeks they will get a chance to do the same thing in terms of the congress should we in fact have ethics committee hearings involving the speaker out in the open with television under the irancontra rules should we in fact have action on two felons one convicted one selfconfessed should we in fact look at the big city machines that are corrupt should we in fact insist very simply either that governor dukakis release his health records or that he withdraw his pledges to have the oval office as an ethics office that there will be no secrets in the dukakis administration in 1988 for the first time in history as i said earlier the people of mexico will have had a greater chance of defeating an incumbent than the people of the united states voting in unitedstates house races that should frighten every citizen who looks at the reality that in 1986 98 5 percent of the incumbents were reelected that requires i think a crusade for honest selfgovernment that is willing to turn over every rock to open up every door to look into every room and that is going to require a lot of citizens to decide on this 200th anniversary of the 1st election under the constitution that it is worth their time and their effort to go out and say to their members of congress to their politicians to their presidential candidate if you cant be honest dont expect my vote if you cant be candid dont expect my vote and i you are going to arrogantly try to deceive me expect me to aggressively try to defeat you only if the citizens are willing to work to contribute to fight for their rights can we expect to have the kind of honest selfgovernment that the founding fathers thought we deserve"], [0.5768287777900696, 0.5768287777900696, 0, "i thank the gentlewoman for yielding and i rise in support of the free trade agreement i strongly support this free trade agreement with canada in my view this agreement is one of the greatest accomplishments of this administration it will greatly increase our global competitiveness and undoubtedly will pave the way for similar agreements with other countries it is easy to got caught up in the industryspecific effects of the agreements and to pin our support or opposition on that basis however if each of us could look at the agreement with a national focus we would support it unanimously the department of commerce conservatively estimates that more than 14 000 now jobs will be created in the american machinery textile clothing paper and furniture manufacturing industries

other americanmade goods including computer parts and books the workers in those industries and the consumers of those goods were harmed then canada instituted a huge tariff on corn imports which hurt american farmers and increased the use of taxpayer dollars for grain storage price supports and deficiency payments the circle never ends the tail of retaliation always comes back to sting us i

california assisted by the gentleman from florida for their efforts in crafting the proposal which we have before us today this measure of course recognizes the contributions of costa rican president arias in presenting his peace plan this initiative has very important democratization demilitarization and nonaggression features during two special orders this member previously has pointed out the details of the arias plan this resolution does applaud and encourage for the central american countries the work that has been done and generally but enthusiastically endorses it it does not mean of course that opportunities do not exist for further change and clarification this member believes for example that implementation questions deadline questions and verification questions ought to be and undoubtedly would be raised in further negotiations and solutions offered to these concerns during the upcoming meeting on the arias proposal but at this point the heads of state of costa rica guatemala el salvador and honduras have already endorsed the preamble to the arias plan and that is a very important step forward this is a peace plan proposed by a central american leader for central america and i think that fact is an extraordinary advantage that it has this gentleman would have preferred frankly to have examined some of the details of the united states policy and approved a sense of the congress resolution on americas foreign policy for central america with respect to nicaragua and central america through a legislative vehicle before the house but this is not the legislation on which to do it i reached that conclusion this morning in the foreign affairs committee when i decided against offering a controversial substitute for the resolutions we are not considering this member sent a dear colleague to members offices on house concurrent resolution 166 which would take up some of those concerns i hope the members will examine and cosponsor it i would say that the first two resolved clauses in that measure are the same as those found in the crockettowens proposal house concurrent resolution 146 before us today i will explain theother two in detail

democracy in central america 2 the congress strongly supports the purpose of this initiative and urges all central america headsofstate to participate actively in a summit meeting to discuss the initiative and to cooperate in this effort to reach a negotiated settlement of the conflict in central america 3 the congress should make such assistance to the nicaraguan resistance forces contingent upon progress within these forces in the development of broadbased civilian leadership committed to democratic norms principles processes and institu tions and to a demonstrated respect for human rights and 4 the congress should not appropriate additional fuids to aid the nicaraguan resistance forces unless a the president finds and reports to the congress and the congress by a majority vote

neighbors including admitted support for the guerrilla forces in el salvador and the excessive nicaraguan buildup of its military forces to the attention of the organization of american states and sought imposition of collective security measures against nicaragua il either 1 the assistance to the nicaraguan resistance forces by the united states government is formally supported by the organization of american states or the nations adjacent to nicaragua or ii even if such support is not expressed the threat posed to the security of the united states by forces in nicaragua is deemed

part of our ability to defend ourselves will be the c17 airlifter i should note that this position was borne out in a recent study by the general accounting office which interestingly enough was requested by opponents of the c17 the gao analysis called the air forces decision to move to a new cargo airlifter to be justified and correct that view has been endorsed by the armed services committee at both the subcommittee and committee level the short of it is the c17 will meet our airlift demands into the 21st century and it will do so in an efficient and cost effective manner the c17 will have many capabilities now lacking in the old c5s it will be both an inter and intratheater plane and will require far less personnel to operate according to the air force the cost of flying

a year to bring about the peace agreement which was signed by the five central american countries on august 7 and he has been working tirelessly since then to ensure that the agreement is implemented

personally claim that i knew mr daniels very well or worked with him closely i arrived here just as he was announcing his intention to retire from this body after serving nine distinguished terms but those who preceded me as ranking minority member in education and labor did know him well and did work closely with him and it is what they said almost 11 years ago on the occasion of the tribute extended to mr daniels upon his retirement that has impelled me to join you today yes they cited mr daniels extraordinary list of legislative accomplishments in the fields of employment and training safety in the work environment and benefits for the working man but then my predecessors quickly added that there was a great deal more to dominick daniels than his work record listen to what they said for it is what we would all aspire to hear said about ourselves there is a question of credibility in peoples minds concerning congress but there never has been a question of credibility in the

united states and the soviet union i know that many members like the trident programand rightly sothe submarine leg of the triad is seen as the most stabilizing of our strategic force why because it is nearly invulnerable to attack and because it is viewed as a retaliatory forceable to eliminate soviet cities and key military installations in response to a soviet attack with the d5 both of these very good reasons for supporting the trident go right out the window the d5 missile adds two destabilizing factors to the equation increased payload and deadly accuracy this combination turns tridents

you cant vote no on everything or youre somehow soft on defense well you are not voting no on everything youre voting to continue the stable deterrence provided by the c4 missile i ask my colleagues

strike the requisite number of words and i rise in support of the amendment as a member of the banking committee i support the gentlewoman from new jerseys important amendment to create an exemption for financial institutions such as banks savings and loan and the security industry i rise in support of this measure because the financial institutions protected by the amendment are a distinct part of our economy deposits at banks savings and loan and credit unions are insured by the federal government losses at these institutions are therefore costly to the federal government that is why the government imposes security requirements on savings institutions the se curity requirements are strict and exacting to comply with federal regulations a great many savings institutions use the polygraph as one important element in their overall security program similarly the securities industry is heavily regulated by the federal government for instance securities firms are prohibited from hiring anyone who has a felony conviction therefore securities firms find that the polygraph is a useful tool in complying with federal law in light of the federal regulatory requirements on financial institutions it is particularly noteworthy that the heads of the principal regulatory agencies the fdic and the sec have written to the members of the house expressing their support for the roukema amendment to exempt financial institutions from h r 1212 in the final analysis for the government to require security programs at financial institutions and then take away those institutions ability

easy to beat up on lawyers i enjoy it myself there is great temptation this morning to join in this party as speaker sara rayburn once said a town too small to support one lawyer can always support two we tried when priceanderson was written years ago we tried to take the lawyers out of it it is not a system with long delay not a system where you see all the difficulties you have in the negligence field the law was written so that you could get in and have this insurance pool that is operated fairly well by the major insurance companies you get yourself in this pool and you do not have to have lawyers payment will be made promptly and adequately when three mile island happened the lawyers and the agents who were involved with this who had experience with it were paying money out in pennsylvania to farmers and local residents within a matter of days the problem has had some difficulties some weaknesses but i want to report that the biggest issuein the energy committee and in our committeethe biggest issde was this business of attorneys fees and we heard in our committee from mr sikorskis allies and he very eloquently presented the case when he got to the energy committee and they made some further modifications in the direction needed so you now have in the bill a modified balanced treatment of claims the court is given discretion under prior criteria you can read this in the report pages 121 to 123 i think it is you can read in therethe weapons that they have available in addition to that we raised the limit to 7 billion which insures that there is less likelihood of money not being available to pay the claimsof deserving citizens whohave been damaged in one of these nuclear accidents i am not the authorized spokesman for the administration on these matters but i call to the attention of my colleagues a message which has just come to the speakers desk from the department of energy i will put the entire letter in the record this message is signed by john s herrington the secretary of energy he says i am writing to urge the house to reject any amendments to h r 1414 the priceanderson amendments act of 1987 which may be offered during floor consideration we are particularly concerned about amendments that would reach beyond the basic compensatory purpose of priceanderson and would threaten to undermine the carefully fashioned consensus bill worked out between the three cognizant house committees and the administration the legislation that has been sent to the house floor is the result of three years of extensive hearings discussions and negotiations priceanderson is essential to the continued availability of nuclear power as an energy supply option and as an instrument to facilitate the departments research and national security activities the administration supports reauthorization of priceanderson and supports the bill currently before the full house however we strongly oppose all efforts to add to the bill any provision to impose new liabilities on department of energy doe contractors such as subrogation or penalties to establish unlimited liability in the unlikely event of an accident or to waive the defenses available under the federal tort claims act if such provisions are contained in the bill placed before the president i will recommend to the president that he disapprove the legislation although we share the objective of ensuring that doe contractors conform their conduct to the highest standard of safety and care we are convinced that the inclusion of any subrogation or penalties provision would strongly discourage contractors from commencing or continuing their relationships with the department such noncompensatory provisions would be totally inconsistent with the objectives of priceanderson and would impose severe burdens on the departments research and national security activities we also object to any amendments that would eliminate the socalled limitation on liability by no longer requiring affirmative congressional action to compensate the public when it appears that claims may exceed the statutory cap enactment of the house consensus bill without further amendment would provide the public more than a tenfold increase in the amount of financial protection afforded under current law if the cap were ever exceeded the absence of congressional involvement in the distribution of funds could lead to endless claims on the unitedstates treasury rendering the system of compensation both inefficient and unpredictable in addition to these two provisions the administration strongly opposes any provision which would for liability purposes treat the department as if it were one of its own contractors changing the rules of government liability struck long ago in the federal tort claims act would represent a major departure from existing law upsetting wellestablished principles that have governed this area of law for years in addition to these inimical provisions we are also opposed to any amendment which would restrict payment of defense costs from the compensation fund until all otherclaims are paid defense costs in the unlikely event of an accident are extremely difficult to predict making co verage of such costs under private insurance contracts virtually impossible to obtain coverage of these costs under priceanderson would prevent the inability to obtain such insurance from discouraging the continued operation of nuclear facilities and future investment in such facilities i encourage the house to renew the priceanderson act without counterproductive provisions designed to legislatively address issues that are unrelated to the compensatory objectives of the act what has troubled me during the process of this bill is that there has been a continuing attempt to make a complicated system out of priceanderson which was designed to be a simple system priceanderson you could write on the back of an envelope what it does it says we need nuclear plants it is our national policy to build them we want to assure people living around those plants who live in fear that if an accident happens damages are going to be paid there was a tradeoff here the tradeoff is no fault you do not have to prove fault you get your money for the damage the other part of the bargain apart from no fault is limitation on damages nobody no insurance company is going to pay an unlimited amount under a nofault system so ours is a nofault provision with the sensible limitation on damages we protect the plaintiff the damaged people the two committees of jurisdiction have considered and debated at great length versions of the sikorski amendment and i urge my colleagues to defeat it as the two committees did"]]}
