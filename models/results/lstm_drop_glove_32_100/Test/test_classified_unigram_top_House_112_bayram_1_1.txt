percent but within the historical context is still a national disgrace and an outrage to have unemployment at 8 6 percent for so very long but were happy to have it because it has been as high as 10

were made in the past decade which led to our current financial crisis now the financial crisis inquiry commission fcic was given the task to investigate the causes of the meltdown of our financial institutions though the commission was unsuccessful in reaching a certain consensus of the exact cause they did however conclude that the financial crisis was avoidable and was the result of the following factors an explosion in risky subprime lending an unsustainable rise in housing prices widespread reports of egregious and predatory lending practices dramatic increases in household mortgage debt and exponential growth in financial firms trading activities unregulated derivatives and shortterm repo lending markets just among a few of the red flags surely with all those factors chairman bernanke should have been more concerned in fact the title of my speech this morning is even with warning signs bernanke failed to sound the alarm in fact he was warned by members of the federal reserve board often the release of transcripts from the federal open market committee fomc meetings in 2006 shed light on the critical failures of the federal reserve and mr bernanke to act when the warning signs were clear and present the first meeting however was spent praising bernankes predecessor outgoing federal chairman alan greenspan but the fcic later concluded that 30 years of deregulation and reliance on selfregulation by financial institutions that was championed by mr greenspan were the factors in devastating the stability of our nations market stripping away safeguards that simply could have avoided this catastrophe now in a later meeting on may 10 2006 of the fomc then fed governor susan bies was one of the earliest to raise concern over the nations mortgage sector which offered exotic loans that increased household debt over time instead of decreasing it now specifically her concerns stem from the absence of home equity growth and the consumers ability to absorb the uncertainties of the housing market listen to mr bernankes response when she made her declaration so far we are seeing at worst an orderly decline in the housing market but there is still i think a lot to be seen as to whether the housing market will decline slowly or more quickly yet again another colleague then fed vice chairwoman janet yellen warns of the possibility of an unwelcome housing slump but in the meeting of august 8 2006 chairman bernanke remains hopeful in his prediction for a soft landing for our economy need i say the 2008 great recession was not a soft landing in the september meeting the feds still remained oblivious to the detrimental effects in the housing market that will affect the rest of the economy in the last meeting of the fomc fed governor bies again in december 2006 stated once again her concern of the housing market stating that mortgages securitized in the past few years warrants additional risk than the investors have been focusing on despite the concerns that reported increased difficulty getting mortgages in their region as well as a noticeable cool down in housing activity mr bernanke fails to see the warning signs and again predicts a soft landing on december 12 2006 once again this was his second statement of a soft landing in the same year it was the failure of mr bernanke to not pursue possible vulnerabilities and assuring us to the contrary that attributed to the economic crisis that we faced on february 15 2007 he stated overall economic prospects for households remains good the labor market is expected to stay healthy and real incomes should continue to rise the business sector remains in excellent financial condition again on march 28 2007 he stated the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime markets seems likely to be contained even on may 17 2007 despite concerns raised by fed governor bies again he said we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system how wrong he was but all of the dire warning signs were there at bernankes confirmation hearing in the senate banking committee he conceded to the notion that the central bank should have done more thats an understatement the fed had the authority and necessary power to prevent further abuses happening in the

a crisis i dont know if youre aware of this but there has been a study made a texas border security study a strategic military assessment and heres an executive summary of the 150 pages it is much more detailed but just to read this very quickly during the past 2 years the state of texas has become increasingly threatened by the spread of mexican cartel organized crime the threat reflects the change in the strategic intent of the cartels to move their operation into the united states in effect the cartels seek to create a sanitary zone inside the texas border one county deep that will provide sanctuary from mexican law enforcement at the same time allow the mexican cartels to transform the texas border counties into narcotics transshipment points for continued transport and distribution into the continental united states to achieve their objective the cartels are relying increasingly on organized gangs to provide expendable and unaccountable manpower to do their dirty work these gangs are recruited on the streets of texas cities and inside texas prisons by toptier gangs who work in conjunction with these cartels so in addition to this threat from iran i mean if you have a plan to seize a part of the united states of america by force i would call that invasion and i would argue that if that is a true statement texas has already put together a task force under the leadership of the texas rangers they are setting up stations along the border with a goal of setting up an intense communication system to be prepared for what may be coming from across the river but they are just a small body of very effective law enforcement people this could be a major major intrusion on the united states add that to their partners iran trying to make a deal with these criminals the zetas its frightening we learned a long time ago in law enforcement that when you create an environment of lawlessness it breeds more lawlessness quite honestly that theory is what cleaned up new york city under rudy giuliani using that theory they said were going to go into neighborhoods and were going to take the street lawlessness out of the neighborhoods so that the big lawlessness will move somewhere else because if theyre in a lawless environment it just enhances lawlessness and it worked and they cleaned up the streets of new york and its a much safer place for people to go these days than it was 20 years ago and its all because of the concept lawlessness breeds lawlessness because we were allowing laws to be violated on our border from brownsville all of the way to san diego we basically created by our own efforts by not enforcing immigration laws and the sovereignty of our country we created a lawlessness area before the cartels got there so when

a program to require licensed gun dealers in the four most dangerous border states to report when an individual buys multiple assault rifles within 5 business daysjust as all dealers have reported multiple handgun sales for over 20 years the current rule is narrowly tailored to generate useful intelligence on illegal gun trafficking by mexican drug cartels according to atf data 70 percent of firearms recovered and traced in drug cartel crimes in mexico originated from the united states we know that semiautomatic assault rifles sold by unitedstates dealers near the border fuel mexican cartel violenceviolence that has killed more than 47 000 people in mexico including thousands of police and military personnel this rule is working in just the past 9 months atf opened more than 120 criminal investigations based on multiple assault rifle sales reports and this action is constitutional the rule is indisputably constitutional the authority to operate such a program has been upheld by federal courts so theres no question about the legal authority but this bill that we will vote on today at the behest of the nra and other gun groups would block funding for this vital law enforcement program unfortunately this is only the latest in a long list of irresponsible actions this congress has taken on gun policy such as the fact that due to congressional action loaded firearms are now permitted in national parks the d c voting rights bill that enjoyed joint bipartisan support was scuttled by requiring restrictions on the d c city council regarding the type of gun safety laws that they could enact if they wanted their right to vote restrictions blocking state and local law enforcement access to important crime gun trace data were made permanent just last year the house passed legislation to override the concealed carry requirements of individual states establishing a lowest common denominator federal standard despite all of these actions to weaken gun laws judging by the outlandish statements from the nra you would think that the second amendment was under constant bombardment wayne lapierre vice president of the nra said last year that the claim that the obama administration has done virtually nothing to restrict the rights of gun owners is a big fat stinking lie he went further to claim that the presidents lack of action is all part of a massive obama conspiracy to deceive voters and hide his true intentions to destroy the second amendment in our country again another lapierre quote actions are supposed to speak louder than words but apparently for some people crazy conspiracy fantasies speak loudest of all instead of weakening gun laws further we should be passing commonsense measures that are supported by the vast majority of americans in fact according to a poll conducted by republican pollster frank luntz 82 percent of nra members and 86 percent of nonnra gun owners support prohibiting suspected terrorists from purchasing guns 69 percent of nra members and 85 percent of nonnra gun owners support background checks for all gun sales at gun shows and yet the nra opposes these commonsense restrictions and gets this congress to do so as well there are bills introduced in congress right now to address these two issues the denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act and the fix gun checks act neither one has received so much as a subcommittee hearing in this republican congress instead we are debating a bill that includes a provision that would remove a modest yet valuable tool for federal

technologysolar wind hydrothe things that everybody in this country wants to support but there hasnt been the money to maintain and upgrade that technology and do the innovations that are necessary in the future the revenue goes towards repairing roads bridges locks and dams developing that renewable energy structure developing clean coal technology and improving nuclear technology twenty percent of the domestic energy supply with electricity comes from the nuclear technologies and it helps develop alternative fuel vehicles i hear all the time the internal combustion engine is a centuryoldplus technology with all of these wonderful things that we have done in this country cant we find a way to make a car run on something other than gasoline it seems like something we should have done a long time ago we havent done it yet were making progress this bill helps us get there whatever that technology may be whether it be electric natural gas some advocate hydrogen but it does the r d thats
