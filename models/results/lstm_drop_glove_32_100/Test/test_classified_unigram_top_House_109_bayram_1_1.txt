tried to get the facts on the matter and it has not been easy to get those facts in the course of our investigation with the helpof the government accountability office we have learned of some pretty terrible things first we found that halliburton was importing oil into iraq at extremely high prices we were particularly concerned about the companys decision to import gasoline from kuwait at a price far above market levels eventually defense auditors agreed and found that there were 263 million in unsupported and questioned costs in these contracts yet last month the corps of engineers ignored their auditors and reimbursed halliburton for 254 millionall but 9 million of the questioned costs this follows a pattern with halliburton the defense auditors had previously questioned 200 million in costs for meal services provided by the company which again was overruled by the army which gave the company 145 million this amendment to deny new contracts to companies that have a history of billing the government for questionable costs is hardly novel in january 2004 the defense contract audit agency itself recommended that the corps not enter into new contracts with

corruption is overwhelming congress and repulsing the public it is time the house rules reflected the ethical standards and common sense of the american people i came to this house 30 years ago and our historic incoming class brought with it one of the strongest tides of reform ever seen rules were changed chairmen were replaced procedures were modernized so that the voice of the people was heard and respected in this house of the people ten years ago the republicans took control of the house promising a new era of reform to read the national newspapers it is evident to everyoneexcept themselvesthat the republicans have betrayed their promise of reform they have tolerated misconduct and enshrined special interests as never before today we give them and all members an opportunity to restore public trust by voting for two commonsense amendments to the house rules first no sitting member should negotiate for a new job with any organization that has had business before his or her committee for a year thats not hard to understood no one should be shaping public policy with an eye on a future private sector salary second no bill should be brought to the house floor unless members have had 3 days to read it first thats not hard to understand we should not be passing bills that are hundreds of pages in lengthsometimes over 1 000 pageswithout ever having seen what is in the bill ronald reagan thought it was a bad idea surely todays house republicans can agree lets be honest aboot it 99 percent of the american people outside the beltway will agree with both of these principlesno negotiating for new jobs with special interests members should know what they are voting on before it becomes law we shouldnt even have to have a debate but we do less than a month ago the nation was stunnedto learn that the committee chairman who had fashioned a blatantly prodrug industry antisenior anticonsumer prescription drug law was retiring and taking a job with the pharmaceutical industry in fact our former colleague assumes his job with piirma today just as we are taking our oaths of office mr tauzin will reportedly be earning a salary nearly 13 times what he earned when he wrote that proindustry billone of the best paid lobbyists in washington he earned it that prescription drug law will enrich him but it takes billions of dollars out of the pockets of americas senior citizens by prohibiting them from purchasing cheaper drugs from canada and by prohibiting the federal government from negotiating with the pharmaceutical industryhis new employerfor lower drug prices thats worth billions to the drug industry while the deal was not announced until last month the discussions began a year ago as was widely reported at the time in fact a top aide to the republican leadership was quoted last january 24 on cnn com as saying that republican congressman tauzins negotiation with pharma doesnt look very good it doesnt look very good today either as millions of seniors face higher drug prices thanks to the tauzin bill and bill tauzin takes office to improve the tattered image of the drug industry we all know this stinks and so do our constituents lets put an end to it today by barring negotiations for private jobs by members of congress thats what our constituents would want us to do and at the same time lets put an end to the outrageous practice of voting on complex and lengthy bills before congress has had time to read thembills like that prescription drug bill bill tauzin wrote while he was listening to pharmas whispers in his ears isnt it bad enough that republicans majority writes the bills in secret without input from the democrats who represent 48 percent of the country without scrutiny by the press without review by the public must we also vote on secret legislation without reading it without knowing the tax breaks and earmarked spending for special interests that have been stuck in without any review i urge all members to put party aside and vote the way your constituents would want you to vote an end to private job negotiations while serving in public office and full disclosure of the contents of legislation before we vote i also vigorously oppose the proposed rule change that would allow an ethics investigation to end after 45 days of the ethics committee of five democrats and five republicans remained deadlocked today the republicans are once again putting partisan politicians ahead of ethics by moving forward with their plan to shield their embattled majority leadertom delayfrom any further investigation the goal of this change is to block the ethics committee from considering pending and future matters that could prove to be damaging to their party under the present rules if the chair and the ranking minority member of the ethics committee cannot agree whether to investigate a complaint the committee begins an initial investigation into the matter but under the republicans proposed rule change the republican chairman of the ethics committeewho is handpicked by the speakercould simply refuse to examine a complaint after 45 days the complaint would be dropped without even an initial investigation into the matter this new rule would allow republicans to block pending ethics matters and prevent future investigations from moving forward and the reason is very simple there are at least two matters currently pending against republican leaders including majority leader tom delay contrary to this mornings press reports the republicans havent backed away from their attempts to shield delay from further investigation theyve simply become a littld more deceptive in how theyre doing it last year when the ethics committee ad monished delay three times it deferred action on another serious chargehis role in funneling illegal soft money into texas races through his state pacuntil after the investigation against him had been completed the

medicaid beneficiaries should at least have access to all medically necessary medications medicare covers breast reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy or accidental injury medicare understands the importance of postsurgical psychological adjustment as women rehabilitate after a damaging cancer treatment or devastating injury are men not entitled to such wholeness after prostate cancer treatment ed drugs help men who have lost sexual function as a result of medical conditions like prostate cancer diabetes multiple sclerosis parkinsons or spinal cord injuries men need these medications not to enhance their lifestyle but to return them to normal just like women need reconstructive surgery to return as close as possible to normal in fact wholeness is so important that according to a university of chicago study 68 percent of men were willing to forego treatments that were more effective in eradicating prostate cancer in order to maintain sexual function why would we force men to choose between the most effective medical treatment and wholeness i could not agree more that we should ban ed drugs for sex offenders but a flat ban on ed drugs for all seniors lowincome americans people with disabilities who have edrelated diseases or conditions is just plain discriminatory and wrong so while i respect the concerns of those who support a total ban on ed drugs i hate to see congress go down this path of political correctness we must offer our seniors our poor and our people with disabilities medically correct health care plans the real answer to controlling the cost of medicare and medicaid is not micromanaging the programs but driving forward the adoption of technology that will enable us to manage chronic illnesses proactively reducing both the cost and suffering of hospitalizati6ns and emergency department visits for our seniors and those disabled amongst us that much said and with the hope that we will allow doctors to determine treatment protocols i

bill contains more than 60 provisions that will improve the lives and wellbeing of servicemembers veterans and other department of veterans affairs va beneficiaries i would like to address a few of the provisions contained in the compromise agreement section 101 of the house amendment would permit veterans and other claimants seeking benefits from va to have the choice of hiring and paying an attorney to represent them before the agency once a notice of disagreement has been filed current law prohibits an attorney from receiving a fee for representing a claimant until the board of veterans appeals renders its first decision on the claim unfortunately the claims process has become very complex and can be very overwhelming to some claimants this provision would give veterans the option of hiring an attorney earlier in the process if they believe they need assistance with their claim unlike some who have opposed this policy change i believe veterans are competent to make their own decision as to whether they want to hire an attorney to assist them with their claim this section is similar to a bill i introduced earlier this year hr 5549 the veterans choice of representation act of 2006 section 401 of the house amendment would authorize the secretary to furnish a memorial headstone or marker for an eligible dependent child whose remains are unavailable or if feasible add a memorial inscription to an existing headstone or marker provided by va currently va may provide a memorial headstone or marker for a veteran spouse or surviving spouse when remains are unavailable however if a spouse and child die at the same time and in the same manner and their remains are unavailable a veteran cannot receive a memorial headstone honoring the child the provision would correct this inconsistency and is identical to a provision what was passed by the house in july 2006 section 402 of the house amendment would extend until december 31 2007 the secretarys authority to furnish a government marker to those families who request one for the marked grave of aveteran buried at a private cemetery and who died on or after september 11 2001 under current law the secretarys authority expires on december 31 2006 this provision was also passed by the house in july of this year section 403 of the house amendment would authorize the secretary to make grants to tribal organizations to assist them in establishing expanding or improving veterans cemeteries on trust lands under current law tribal organizations are not eligible for state cemetery grants this provision was passed by the house in july 2006 section 404 of the house amendment would direct the secretary of the army to remove the remains of russell wayne wagner from arlington national cemetery and establish procedures that the secretary must follow in carrying out this directive mr wagner was a convicted murderer who died in prison but slipped through a crack in the law and was inurned at

why in the introduction to the bill it says that its purpose is to hold the current regime in iran accountable for its threatening behavior and to support a transition of its government and i would just ask one question could it be possible that others around the world and those in iran see us as participating in threatening behavior we should make an attempt to see things from other peoples view as well i want to give you three quick reasons why i think we should not be going at it this way first this is a confrontational manner of dealing with a problem a country thatis powerful and selfconfident should never need to resort to confrontation if one is confident one should be willing to use diplomacy whether dealing with our friends or our enemies i think the lack of confidence motivates resolutions of this type the second reason that i will give you for opposing this is that this is clearly seeking regime change in iran we are taking it upon ourselves that we do not like the current regime i dont like almadinyad but do we have the responsibility and the authority to orchestrate regime change we approach this by doing two things sanctions to penalize at the same time giving aid to those groups that we expect to undermine the government do you know if somebody came into this country and paid groups to undermine our government that is illegal yet here we are casually paying money millions of dollars unlimited sums of money to undermine that government this is illegal the third point this bill rejects the notion of the nonproliferation treaty the iranians have never been proven to be in violation of the nonproliferation treaty and this explicitly says that they cannot enrich uranium even for private and commercial purposes for these three reasons we

consume hybrid pension plans represent an important component of worker retirement security in fact more than 9 million workers today rely on these benefits for a safe retirement unfortunately some continue to paint a misleading picture about these pension plans despite these claims hybrid plans actually provide more generous benefits for the majority of workers than do traditional plans ej 1745 these conclusions emerge from a growing body of independent research by economists and acaderhics at some of the nations most respected institutions including the federal reserve board the urban institute the brookings institution and the wharton school of business not only are hybrid plans especially advantageous for women and lowerpaid workers but they also comprise the only part of the defined benefit system that is growing hybrid plans now provide the pbgc with approximately 25 percent of its premium income and because the total number of defined benefit plans has declined significantly over the last 20 years it is now more important than ever to encourage employers to stay in the defined benefit system and offer these benefits the threat of liability is creating ongoing legal uncertainty and undermining the retirement security of american workers however a few conversions from traditional plans to hybrid plans have raised policy questions about whether such conversions are age discriminatory but notably the vast majority of conversions have been handled properly within the rule of law and to benefit the workers in a typical hybrid plan a participants account is credited each year with pay and interest credits hybrid opponents have argued that benefits for younger workers are ultimately higher than benefits provided to older workers because younger workers accrue interest and earn benefits over a longer period of time this is tantamount to arguing that the concept of compounding interest is age discriminatory which would make the most basic savings account illegal in short the argument holds no water recent court decisions made clear that no age discrimination occurs with theseplans if the pay and interest credits attributed to older employee accounts are equal to or greater than those of younger workers and the majority of courts have ruled that hybrid and other hybrid plans are not age discriminatory moreover under the employee retirement income security act and the internal revenue code benefits earned under a traditional plan cannot be reduced when they are converted to a hybrid plan that is right in spite of assertions to the contrary vested benefits earned by workers are never reduced in a hybrid conversion the pension protection act which was approved by a bipartisan majority in the house last december helps resolve the legal uncertainty surrounding hybrid plans and ensures they remain a viable part of the defined benefit system the measure establishes a simple age discrimination standard for all defined benefit plans that clarifies current law with respect to age discrimination requirements on a prospective basis and it prohibits the reduction of any vested benefits workers have earned during a conversion to a hybrid plan our ultimate goal is to ensure hybrid plans remain a viable option for employers who want to remain in the defined benefit system and workers who prefer the portable and secure benefit this option provides the pension protection act provides a balanced approach that protects the benefits workers have earned and provides the legal certainty needed to encourage employers to continue offering these benefits this democrat motion to instruct would place harsh mandates on those who voluntarily offer these pension benefits which is particularly harmful at a time when so many are leaving the defined benefit system altogether i urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion to instruct and reject this attempt to obscure progress on pension reform i reserve the balance of mytime"],

exceptions for another responsible adult family member to accompany the minor and 3 the language is so broad that it would allow a cab or bus driver to be prosecuted you are probably wondering why i voted for the bill even with these concems well as a parent i feel strongly that parents should be involved in major decisions concerning the health and wellbeing of their children the most

another state this is where the web gets really tangled you see in some cases the minor would have to comply with the laws of two states and in all cases the doctor wouldhave to get consent from the parent in person and a mandatory 24hour waiting period would be instituted probably the most striking scenario would be a minor who traveled between states with no parental consent law in this case the doctor would have to obtain consent in person from the parent the mandatory 24hour waiting period would be instituted and in this specific case there would be no judicial bypass option this creates quite a burden on doctors who would be required to have a nearencyclopedic knowledge of the parental involvement laws in each of the 50 states their specific requirements and their judicial

american superhero that few people have ever heard of dr borlaugs campaign to save the lives of the worlds neediest people through agricultural science deserves special recognition how many lives has he saved dr borlaugs innovative leadership in plant breeding and agricultural production is credited with saving the lives of nearly 1 billion people from starvation that is right one billion souls in 1994 he was given the task of researching highyield and diseaseresistant cereal grains through trial and error dr borlaugs successful efforts led to the development of varieties of wheat that completely altered production agriculture as it was known then in places like pakistan and india and mexico the dwarf wheat variety he developed allowed farmers to produce far more grain per acre than apiyone could have predicted this newfound bounty gave the worlds poorest people access to food ensuring that children who would have been victims of malnutrition could thrive his landmark discoveries in agriculture led to what is called today the green revolution dr borlaug is a legendary figure within the agricultural community and his name is held in high regard around the world however this cresco iowa native is a very modest man who once said that his accomplishments were a temporary success in mans war against hunger and deprivation almost 40 years since receiving the nobel peace prize he continues at age 92 to work for improvement of mankind for this reason i introduced h r 4924 which is a bill to award dr norman borlaug the congressional gold medal for his lifetime of service to th6 world dr borlaugs leadership has inspired so many of our best and brightest students to pursue careers in agricultural sciences his work and the work of future innovators will live on in the lives

research and education and as the uncle of a little boy with autism i am wellacquainted with the issues faced by families of children with this disorder i have been struck by the rapid in crease in the number of children diagnosed with autism in the last decade both nationally and in my home state of rhode island and while we do not yet know for certain what causes autism we do know that early intervention does make a difference in treatment we must commit ourselves to providing parents pediatricians early childhood educators and all those who have contact with very young children the resources and training to identify children who need help early enough to begin effective interventions the combating autism act is a tremendous step toward an effective national policy of autism research screening intervention and education like all children those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders are individuals with unique talents and abilities across the nation special education teachers psychologists and others are working hard to bring these gifts and talents to light and help these children realize their potential i urge all of my colleagues to support these professionals in their noble work and these families in their time of need by voting in favor of the combating autism act it is the right thing to do its an exciting piece of legislation and i look forward to its passage"], [0.023069947957992554, 0.47693005204200745, 0, "i move to strike the last word i thank the chair and i appreciate the discussion and the debate that we have had on this amendment i join with the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member of the subcommittee in opposing this amendment it would jeopardize one of the most critical abilities to detect and prevent terrorist attacks on the united states in addition it would interfere with an ongoing course of oversight that has been conducted on a bipartisan basis by the leadership in the authorizing committee since the inception of this program it is the day after 9 11 and the president has asked nsa other partsof the intelligence community the military what is the threat how do we most effectively respond and what is the threat to the nation and he has asked the intel community and the military to come back with various options as how best to protect the united states in that time of uncertainty and the execative branch and the various agencies come back with a series of proposals as to exactly what they believe can be done and should be done to keep america safe the president doesnt act unilaterally the president acts in a collaborative basis it is not an overreaching of an executive to my colleague from arizona if a president of the other party went through the same processes that this president went through and exercised these authorities would i support that president my answer would be different than my colleague from arizona the answer would be yes because the process was very straightforward four times within the first 8 months after 9 11 it was a collaborative process between leaders of this house and the unitedstates senate who sat down with the executive branch and reviewed this program in detail do you know what they said this is a program that is necessary in a time of unceytainty we support this program and it needs to move forward we have had some discussions and disagreements as to the extent of the number of people that should have been briefed on the authorizing committee we have worked through that process and now every single person who has the desire to be briefed on this program is briefed on the program and have had the opportunity or will be given the opportunity when they get new questions to have every single one of their questions answered we have a way ahead on our authorizing committee the ranking member has introduced legislation that she thinks may address some of the issues but we know that fisa and electronic surveillance is a very very difficult issue because technology has changed significantly since fisa was originally developed and so we are going to move forward and i am thrilled that within the intelligence committee we are going to continue a bipartisan way ahead it doesnt mean we are going to agree but it does mean that we have laid out a process as to what the needs are of the intelligence community to keep america safe what the legal framework is and evaluate the changes in technology and the environment so that we can do the necessary oversight and protect and balance civil liberties with the needs of americas security"]]}
