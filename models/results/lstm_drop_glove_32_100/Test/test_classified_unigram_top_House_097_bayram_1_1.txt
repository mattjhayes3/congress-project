regarding the conference report on h r 7072 the agriculture appropriations for fiscal year 1983 on two itemsthe limited resource loan program and fmha deferral policy this is the first time that the limited resource loan program has been specifically mentioned in an appropriations bill in the past this program which is an earmark of funds within the fmha operating and ownership loan programs for low income limited resource family farmers has been authorized in the fmha loan reauthorization legislation this year the house passed an fmha loan reauthorization bill which contained a 25percent earmark of fmha operating and ownership loan money for the limited resource loan program the senate agriculture committee in its reauthorization bill set aside 15 percent of operating and ownership money for this same program however the fmha reauthorization bill has not and appears it will not get to the senate floor this session of congress because of that and because of the clear sentiment in both houses in support of the limited resource loan program an amendment was attached to the fiscal year 1983 agriculture appropriations bill on the senate floorthe amendment earmarked 20 percent of the operating and ownership loan money for low income limited resource farmers the purpose of the amendment was to insure in the temporary absence of an authorization that the administration continue to operate this program senate report language on the agriculture appropriations bill reads the committee remains concerned about the continued difficulty young persons are experiencing in getting started in farming the committee notes that current authority provides that not less than 20 percent of the funds provided for farm real estate and ownership loans shall be used for limited resource borrowers this authority should not be interpreted as a cap but as a minimum level for limited resource loans fmha should place increased emphasis on assisting new entrants to farming to that end the committee will expect fmha to fully utilize the limited resource loan program to assist young persons getting started in farming the committee will expect to be kept informed on actions taken to comply with this directive the committee has added language which will continue the authority for limited resource loans in fiscal year 1983 as in the case of real estate loans the committee will expect fmha to fully utilize the limited resource loan program lo assist young persons getting started in farming the language in the conference report before us today however makes the use of the 20 percent of funds in the fmha real estate and operating programs for low income limited resource farmers discretionary the reason for this is that the conferees felt that an earmark of funds for this program would constitute authorizing language in an appropriations billwhile i understand and appreciate this jurisdictional problem i hope that the administration will in a recognition of congressional intent continue the limited resource loan program i am confident furthermore that early in the 98th congress we will pass fmha loan program reauthorization legislation which will contain a specific earmark of funds for this pro gram on the matter of fmha deferral policy the conferees adopted language which refers to the current law regarding the secretarys deferral authority and goes on to say the conferees will expect the secretary to make maximum use of his discretion under all authorities available to him to avoid loan collection actions that would force out of business these family farmers the senate adopted language in the agriculture appropriations bill which was identical to language in a bill introduced by myself and congressman dorgan our bill subsequently passed the house as part of h r 5831 while i welcome the language in this conference report urging the secretary to more fully utilize his deferral authority i intend to work next session to get signed into law the launguage contained in h r 5831language which says that under certain conditions family size farmers are entitled to deferrals the language says that furthermore fmha must notify borrowers of the existence of deferrals and other servicing remedies and of the limited resource loan program it is evident that fmha does not as a matter of course inform loan applicants and borrowers of the existence of these programs farmers must know what their options are under the law and regulations and must be able to make application for those options i am disappointed that the senate leadership did not see fit to bring the fmha reauthorization bill to the senate floor this year as that would have been a more appropriate vehicle to deal with the issue of deferrals and other credit issues i

century in each case he weathered the test in meeting these challenges he left as his legacy programs that define our presentday social and economic system and a style of leadership that is the test against which we measure the performance of our presidents today as we face a time of economic trial today it is helpful to look back to see how f d r met the grave economic challenge of his time and to see what lessons we can draw for ourselves today the programs enacted during the roosevelt administration are now so much a part of the fabric of our society that we tend to take the benefits of these programs for granted we assume they have always been there one way to appreciate the roosevelt legacy is to remember what it was like before f d r s new deal before f d r no federal program provided the elderly with any degree of security in their retirement years after f d r there was social security before f d r no ones savings deposits were secure after f d r the federal government insured savings accounts before f d r adequate regulation of the securities market did not exist after f d r the stock market was regulated to protect investors and the larger economy before f d r workers could be fired for union activity after f d r the workers right to organize into free trade unions was secured as joe alsop reminds us in his recent book on f d r the roosevelt legacy may be summed up by saying he included the excluded until roosevelt many of the economic and political benefits of this land were denied to those who were not rich not white and not of an anglosaxon protestant background f d r began the process still incomplete of including the previously excluded groups of americans into our society economy and politics roosevelts greatness lies not only in the programs he left us but also in the way he exercised leadership for many of us today the way that f d r exercised leadership still provides the model against which we evaluate contemporary presidents what were some of the keys to f d r s effective leadership one key to his leadership was that he was a master communicator f d r was effective in all settingslarge audiences as well as small groups he was particularly effective in the use of radio which was the most important means of communication in his time f d r also had a gift of explaining some very complex ideas and proposals in a way that was understandable to everyone another important element in his leadership was his emphasis on experimentation f d r was not a prisoner of any ideology he wanted results in order to achieve results he was open to ideas from just about any source if something did not work he would reject it and try something else f d r was also very effective in conveying a sense of optimism about the future but it is not enough just to convey optimism such optimism has to be credible i i many presidents who try to convey optimism are unconvincing roosevelts optimism however was believable people believed that things would actually get better they felt this way because they saw he actually had a program that was workable and was fair to everyone wlat useful lessons for today can we draw from the roosevelt years first we must not stray from the inclusionary principle laid down by f d r it is the right path it is the fairest it has brought unequaled benefits to the people of our nation but in following the path of f d r we must also remember his emphasis on experimentation and results we should continue his work but do it as he would have done itwith an openndss to new ideas and an emphasis on what works just like roosevelt we should not be blindly attached to policies of the past that have become outmoded our test should be what works conditions change problems are solved we should be willing to reassess policies in the light of changing conditions and if we decide that a policy is no longer appropriate it is not an admission that the policy was always wrong it is only an admission that it is not appropriate or useful under todays conditions to continue the work begun by f d r of including the previously excluded and to do so in the manner of f d r with an openness to new ideas and a

will be permitted in the united states 113fs may be established by unitedstates depository institutions by edge and agreement corporations and by unitedstates branches and agencies of foreign banks the board issued proposed rules last december and adopted the final rule june 18 1981 with an effective date of in brief an ibf may accept deposits from and extend credit to foreign residents or other ibfs all such funds will be exempt from reserve requirements and from interest rate limlitations of regulation q the purpose of ibfs at unitedstates banking offices is to enhance the international competitive position of banking institutions in the united states consistent with this basic purpose it now becomes necessary to review thle february 18 1981 interpretation of fdic to thle effect that ibf deposits are subject to fdic insurance assessments under the federal deposit insurance act the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision regulation and insurance of thle house banking committee heard testimnony that if unitedstates ibfs are required to pay the fdic premium amounting to onetwelfth of 1 percent of their deposits then they will be comnpetitive y disadvantaged this premium is considered especially important because as the testimony indicated many ibfs may operate on very narrow margins title i of h r 4879 would eliminate the insurance requirement for what in essence are deposits of extremely sophisticated international investors seeking the highest possible yields with the december 3 effective date nearing congress has an opportunity to prevent burdensome regulation and at the same time insure competitive equality between unitedstates and foreign banks by actinig in a manner fully consistent with the letter and spirit of theo federal reserve boards action in permitting the establishment of ibifs title i of the bill also includes an amendment adopted at full committee markup extending fdic deposit insurance coverage to branches of insured banks operating in the trust territory of the pacific islands currently fdics authority to insure deposits includes areas in the pacific such as guam and american samoa but under current law fdic cannot offer insurance in the trust territory fslics authority to insure thrift deposits does include the trust territory therefore title i of the bill would expand fdics authority to cover the trust

mortgage purchases both by the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association present charter requirements limit the dollar value of loans which are more than 1 year old when sold to 20 percent of the total value of conventional mortgages in fhlmcs or fnmas portfolios this limitation will soon raise serious problems in connection with new programs under which fhlmc and fitma will use their currently unused capacity to purchase or place older mortgages and it is expected as a result provide improved liquidity to mortgage lending institutions this is november 17 1 981 the highly successful swap program of the federal home loan mortgage corporation this program in the short period it has been in effect has been popular indeed inasmuch as it permits the swapping of older lowyielding mortgage loans for mortgage corporation participation certificates pcs these illiquid mortgages responsible in large part for difficulties being encountered by the thrift industry are converted into highly liquid securities ultimately additional funds are freed up for new mortgage funding i have been advised by fhlmc that with its most recent auction fhlmc has virtually reached its 20 percent ceiling for all practical purposes and that absent this legislation now the program must be shut down until such time as purchases of new mortgages in the corporations other programs made it possible to hold another swap auction it is now clear that the value of new loans will be depressed for 1982 and as a consequence it seems unlikely that the swap program can be offered at anywhere near a level commensurate with the need and demand unless congress approves this legislation another provision of title ii would give the same seller service status to fdic and

relatively short span of 4 years wayne has played a very active and effective legislative role in congress it has been my good fortune to have worked closely with wayne on the public works and transportation committee he has been a particularly valuable member of our aviation and water resources subcommittees having served as a fighter pilot in world war ii wayne has had a special interest in aviation his experience and expertise in this area have enabled him to make an important contribution to the cause of a safe and efficient airport and airway system wayne brought to the public works and transportation committee and to the post office and civil service committee on which he has also served a firsthand knowledge of public works transportation and other needs facing the cities and towns of america that background also served him well as a member of the suburban caucus and the travel and tourism caucus with his extensive knowledge of local transportation needs it therefore was only natural that wayne should play a key congressional role in important transportation projects such as the century freeway project which provides for the construction of a roadway through the very heart of los angeles county eventually to connect the east and west sides wayne grishams world war ii experience which included being shot down over germany and becoming a prisoner of war undoubtedly helped shape his great appreciation for and commitment to a strong national defense and he has worked tirelessly and effectively to that end throughout his service in the house wayne has also built a strong record in support of fiscal responsibility in government a balanced budget lower taxes less government intervention and a reduction in both government spending and excessive regulation he has pursued his concern for reducing government regulation as a very active member of the regulatory reform task force those of us who have had the opportunity to serve with wayne

particularly so in assessing the proper roles of the federal government he has led the fight to limit the growth and size of government to end unfair government competition with the private sector and to protect the rights of states against encroachment from the federal government he has also applied his expertise as a member of the energy research and production subcommittee to the vital search for workable solutions to our nations energy problems all americans can be thankful for the successful efforts of barry goldwater jr in guiding his landmark 1974 right to privacy act into public law

secretary of energy james edwards in order to put the results of that press conference into proper perspective i would like to remind everyone of the following first the citizens of this nation have seen the price of energy almost triple in less than 2 2 years second the united states faces a hydrocarbon fluid energy crisis for the next 20 to 30 years third while consumption of oil is expected to drop by 1990 the domestic production of oil is expected to drop at a faster rate increasing or at least maintaining our current rate of imported oil fourth the united states is enormously endowed with abundant hydrocarbon fluid resources since it is estimated that we have as much conventional oil left as we have already produced fifth at least 85 percent of this nations remaining oil is owned by the federal government sixth up to 60 percent of our remaining oil is estimated to be located in the ocs seventh the ocs oil and gas pro gram has returned to the general treasury in excess of 10 billion in the past 2 years and eighth last year the united states paid foreign countries around 80 billion for imported oil these are alarming and curious facts our energy problems center around domestic consumption of oil our low level of domestic production and therefore our inordirate dependence on foreign nations for such a high percentage of our oil needs this negatively impacts upon the value of the dollar abroad inflation and national security the question arises however if we are so abundant in energy resources why are we so dependent on foreign nations for such a high percentage of our needs the fact is that domestic production is stagnant and is expected to drop over the next 10 years unless there is a change in the existing policies of the federal government it has been the land use and leasing policies of past administrations that have been at the root of many of this nations energy problems this has been pointed out in numerous studies including three studies recently released by the gao it is this area that has been impacted by todays press conference secretary of the interior james watt proposed historic revisions in the policies and procedures for leasing ocs oil and gas resources the new 5 year ocs leasing schedule which incorporates the changes represents a crucial step in our efforts to help ourselves out of our energy problem some of the proposed changes announced today include but are not limited to the following first offering of the high potential ar eas in alaskan waters and the atlantic ocean at earlier dates than the old doi leasing schedule second focusing the leasing efforts on areas of highest potential third conducting areawide eiss and resources evaluations fourth areawide lease offerings and fifth 42 lease sales over the next 5 years instead of 36 this country lags behind the other nations with active ocs programs in spite of the fact that we were the leader in ocs drilling and are currently the leader in ocs safety and technology the united states currently only gets 9 3 percent of its domestic oil and about 21 percent of its domestic gas production from its ocs over 21 percent of total world oil production comes from the ocs in other words in spite of enormous hydrocarbon potential a safety record that is the envy of the world and the supplies and capital to do the job the united states is not only lagging behind the rest of the world in ocs production but is falling further behind if the policies that have been announced today are adopted these trends can be reversed as was pointed out in an

the university of chicago breeder reactors were the golden vision a dream that many of us held with almost religious conviction we had found a way of providing man with energy essentially forever those days were the beginning of what science 1982 recently called one of the longest most expensive and most controversial energy development projects the united states has ever undertaken in other words the dream that breeder reactors would provide for much of our energy needs by breeding more energy than they consumed is at a standstill the clinch river breeder reactor 11 years after this program was initiated not one bulldozer has cut ground at the 1 400acre site in oak ridge tenn yet in 1982 this year the tennessee valley authority was scheduled to begin providing electricity to its local consumers by means of the crbr through the years clinch river has encountered many roadblocks numerous environmental lawsuits have challenged the health safety and strategic risks involved with plutonium the fuel form which powers breeder reactors in 1977 president carter suspended the nuclear regulatory commissions licensing of the clinch river plant last november a senate amendment to the energy and water appropriations measure which would have terminated funding for the project lost by a mere two votes on may 17 for the second time in 2 weeks the nrc rejected a bid for waivers of normal licensing requirements to speed up construction and a recent general accounting office report sates that the department of energys plan to build and install the clinch river breeder reactors steam generators before testing a prototype is hasardous and financially risky and should be dropped originally breeder reactors were thought to be a sound idea because it i 3561 had been predicted that by the year 2000 our supplies of uranium which fuel conventional nuclear reactors would be scarce several months ago however the research advisory board of the department of energy recommended postponing the crbr indefinitely since it is now know that the united states has ample uranium deposits for the next 40 years in addition the technology associated with conventional nuclear powerplants has advanced so that they can be run more fuel efficiently even the french who have been operating their phonix demonstration plant at creysmalville for 8 years acknowledge that when there is no uranium shortage breeder reactors are uneconomical which leads me to the conclusion that the only part of the breeder reactor dream which has not died is its pricenow estimated at 3 5 billion already we have spent more than 1 billion on a project that we estimated in 1972 would cost 669 million yet we are faced with a request for 252 5 million to fund clinch river in a year when the deficit is projected to be 99 billion this morning a press conference was held to announce the formation of the taxpayers coalition against clinch river comprised of 15 organizations which support the elimination of funding for the crbr in the federal budget in the past i have supported numerous amendments to various bills which sought to discontinue funding this project and i also have written to the president accordingly i continue to feel that any project which goes on for as long as clinch river without private industry at least sharing the costs with the federal treasury then that project has become obsolete economically unfeasible or environmentally unsound i do not advocate terminating research projects designed to find alternative energy sources and i am not against nuclear power perhaps we could pick up the project at a later date funding it jointly with private industry but this year in this budget i maintain that it is unwise and uneconomical to fund an extravagance such as

wallenberg to be an honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who

additions in funding or new starts again this year contrary to what has been suggested during the discussion and debate on the rule there are no new starts in this bill there is nothing in this bill for water development that is not authorized except one locality that is being washed away at an unbelievable rate by erosion from the lake and the community is losing not only its roads and beach but also losing houses today now we could sit here today and we as a committee could say we are sorry we have no authorization to do something about this but in compassion for those who are losing their property and for the environment that is being destroyed not only by storms but everyday just by natural wave reaction and actions of the waves the committee saw fit to add a small sum here to start resolving and doing something about this erosion that is brought about by natural causes the committee has made some minor changes from the presidents recommendations in most instances we are below

concern with the office of management and budget with the president with the other body and we are working together trying to do just that but we do have some differences about priorities what programs shall be funded and how much now we can argue about the out years those are the years 1983 1984 and 1985 the office of management has taken the figures that we have this year and fully funded what we have appropriated in existing projects this year if we carried them out to those years it is true that if we took no restraint by this body we bust the budget but that is not any different than we had 3 or 4 years ago when some of these were started if we fully funded those we would exceed the budget today the committee and congress has done something about it we have said no on many occasions we have exercised restraint and we will continue to do that but it is not within the power nor the authority of this congress seated today to exercise the future will of congress that we will not spend or that we shall spend we all know we cannot obligate future congresses so it is unfair to say that the outlays the out years will exceed the budget i am sure that future congresses

found that small businesses face impediments in federal r d procurement not found in the private sector the report agreed to by every senior cabinet department official directs that changes be made but they have not occurred we must now do by statute wlfat could have been done years ago why must this program be mandatory because 6 years of inaction make it clear that the bureaucracy will not 9hange unless required to do so it is too easy for them to just wait it out we know from the nih example that they will not change unless forced to do it we want to open the door providing a way to bring innovative ideas into use in testimony given by a small anticancer drug manufacturer who had five derivitives that proved positive in initial tests we heard that this forprofit business did not qualify at nih so they formed a nonprofit subsidiary and got funding on two out of three proposals is this the way we must do business just the other day a small business that testified before our committee announced that it has perfected the commercial production of interferon from genespliced yeast its seed money came not from nih it could not qualify here is how our program will work each agency decides what its own research priorities are then in phase i of the sbir program the agency decides on which research topics among these priorities small business can submit proposals these proposals are evaluated on the basis of scientific and technical merit and feasibility they are eligible for up to 50 000 for feasibility research in phase ii awards up to 500 000 are available but merit and feasibility are the keys our competition is based on merit and feasibility will there be competition yes our twoline tests show that there were eight qualifying projects for each one funded at nsf and 10 to 1 at dod that is competition this idea works since the korean war when dod realized how important small business was to the defense effort we have had a small business setaside our most recent test 1982 shows that when the air force setaside 181 contracts for hightech spare parts it saved 38 5 percent per contract average savings on some contracts ran as high as 99 5 percent

promises broken commitments or lastminute patchwork solutions we are asking for a mandatory program that in its first year setsaside for small busir ess competition 20 percent of the ariount of r d

levitas commenced the inquiry that is the subject and the point that we are discussing here tonight this goes back some time i think we should mention the chronology of events so that we understand why we are here tonight the gentleman from georgia came to my district he accompanied myself some law enforcement officials some informants in a helicopter and we went around the new york region we heard about the problems that were occurring the deadly problem of dumping of toxic wastes that we must deal with we should not be here tonight it really disturbs me as a new member of this body that we have failed to be able to reach an agreement so that we did not have to take up this resolution tonight but why did we fail why did we fail was the fault with chairman levitas no indeed not for 3 months he has attempted to get the information for 3 months we waited and indeed in the beginning the information was made accessible there came a time when the investigative staff of his subcommittee visited region ii in new york city and they were told no more files will be made accessible to you when asked why the answer was we have got orders from washington not to release any more files now we have a confrontation i disagree respectfully with my colleague from new york a good friend of mine that ample time was allowed if it was not for the fact that a citation was issued that a subpena was issued backed up with a contempt charge we would not have made the progress that we have made it is only within the last 48 hours that there 4has been any serious negotiation that is what it takes the issues are complex but what it boils down to is this we are told in committee hearings that 10 regions in this country have to sit down their staffs have to sift through their files and unilaterally make a determination as to what are sensitive documents we as members of congress imagine do not have the right to see those documents yet all of the staff employees and they could be gs5 or whatever have the right to look through those socalled sensitive documents i can tell you that i had a personal experience in my state where the new york state department of environmental conservation oversaw the cleanup of a chemical dump and permitted hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil that they said was waste oil and was listed in the manifest as waste oil but which was heavily ladened with pcbs i will tell you where we got that information we got it from their own files we did not know where to find that information we picked out files at random but not at first because they denied us access so i learned a lesson the hard way i learned that indeed the agencies that we entrust to protect our loved ones and we have evidence of children playing in toxic chemicals and the gao has testified that there are as many as 50 000 dump sites in the country i do not think there is a more serious problem that we are going to be confronted with in this congress and i am disturbed that we spend titie trying to get the possession of documents when perhaps we should be spending more time at the root problem stopping the dumping of toxic wastes in this country only when we do that can we effectively cope with the cleanup problem but i must say that chairman levitas has really extended himself and i myself have asked ms gorsuch to cooperate to offer recommendations so that we could

about economic recovery in this country from a substantive standpoint however i must confess grave misgivings over the presidents victory i did not support the presidents tax package because i did not believe it to be in the best interests of the people of the third district according to most economists it will prove inflationary and it will result in massive budget deficits and continued high interest rates over the next 3 years the congressional budget office has estimated that the federal government will run a budget deficit of 80 billion by 1984 if the presidents 3year tax cut were enacted federal deficits are one of the chief causes of high interest rates which have devastated the housing and timber industries in my district thousands of men and women in my district have been thrown qut of work in some of the counties that i represent unemployment is a staggering 16 percent all told the unemployment rate in my district is 11 percent compared to a national jobless rate of about 7 3 percent for the same period the presidents budget cuts and yesterdays tax plan will be a savage onetwo punch to the people of my district funding for social service programs including unemployment compensation and job training will be slashed just as high inflation and continued record interest ratesfueled by this tax cutthrow still more people out of work we must balance the budget the federal deficit is approaching 1 trillion it cost 75 billion just to finance that debt last year mr reagans tax cut proposal refuses to address these realities the vast majority of the people in the third district agree with me on his point even though many of them siay support the president anyway it is a testimony to his public relations skill in a recent poll i sent to all constitu ents in the third district 64 percent said they would not support a tax cut that results in higher federal deficits nationwide polls have found that 70 percent of all americans would rather pass up a tax cut in 1982 in order to balance the budget in good conscience i could not support a policy which would pay for a tax cut by federal borrowing the second central issue in the tax debate was who would benefit the reagan plan skewed the tax cut to the 5 percent of the population earning more than 50 000 a year the median income in the third district is only 9 736 with a mere 18 percent of the families earning more than 15 000 a tax cut that favors the wealthy simply is not in the best interests of my constituents another disturbing factor in the reagan proposal is that it ignores the interests of small business the backbone of the american economy and of the third district the president has skewed his proposal to favor the largest corporations i supported a third alternative tax cut bill which would have provided meaningful tax cuts for middleincome americans and productivity incentives for amcerican businesses but would have resulted in a 2 billion budget surplus next year and a 20 billion surplus by 1983 it did so by eliminating the billions of dollars of special interest loopholes for the oil companies and commodity tradc rs found in the reagan proposal a tax cut

may be waived under certain circumstances i rise in support of the mccurdy amendment on selected acquisition reports with the understanding that mr mccurdy will accept my amendment concerning the waiver provision for sars the mccurdy amendment as amended by my amendment will have the effect of increasing congressional awareness of weapons costs while insuring that the department of defense is not forced to prepare the 100 or more sars that would be required by the increase in the sar dollar thresholds together the emery and mccurdy amendments will provide the congress with a more incisive look at the cost growth in major weapons programs a discussion of the problem that brought my colleague and i to these amendments would be in order in the fiscal year 1982 defense authorization bill senator nunn added a requirement for very strict cost reporting on weapons systems which are suffering from unacceptable cost increases and schedule slippages the mccurdy amendment incorporates the provisions of the nunn amendment and prbvides for exception reporting when there is a cost overrun of more than 15 percent the amendment also provides for 1 yearly sar of a comprehensive nature to be complemented by quarterly sars when problems develop in weapons systems finally the amendment eliminates the discretion of the secretary of defense in determining which programs will undergo the sar process the original emery amendment shared several provisions with the mccurdy amendment including the increase of the reporting thresholds to 200 million in r d and 1 billion in procurement funding

cost anything it occurs to me that in the discussion that we have been having on process we have managed to forget some very recent history last year we adopted a piece of legislation that the majority leader the other day held in his hand and shook into our faces with justification and reminded us all how that piece of legislation running over 800 pages was adopted by this house without having been seen or read by practically anybody including the sponsors that was able to be done because of the socalled reconciliation provision of the budget act it is not only members of this body

what it was that we were doing in the dead of night time magazine on april 26 of lhis year described our action a year ago in this way unfortunately the result was a bill that whatever its economic merit or lack of same ranks as one of the sloppiest pieces of legislation ever approved by congress it was a shambles of bits and pieces containing unnumbered pages and handwritten notes yet congress was awed by a president who claimed a mandate for change and had a gift for persuading the public it tamely adopted a budget that made a mockery of recent reforms and insulted the legislative process now what the budget committee did last year as it did the year before under the carter administrationand that is why i say this is really bipartisanis to come to this house with a recommendation that as part of the first budget resolution we provide for the adoption of a socalled reconciliation bill which would mandate the adoption of legislation forcing the cuts which were incorporated in the first budget resolution now what is wrong with that what is wrong with it is that as the budget act was first adopted in 1974 under the management of our distinguished rules committee chairman the gentleman who is now presiding as chairman of the committee of the whole house it was intended that the first budget resolution would be simply a target would set goals for us there was to be nothing final or fixed about it that was supposed to come later when we knew what the economic conditions were of the year to see whether the assumptions of the spring still held in the fall last year for example by the time we got around to the second budget resolution we were 40 billion more in deficit than we had anticipated we would be in the springtime and yet we were stuck we had already adopted the reconciliation bill the distortion that has taken place with a 40 billion mandated cut last year and i believe about 8 billion the year before has led some to suggest that if that process continues we will not have the constitutional separation of powers that was intended by the founders of this nation nor would we have this congress composed of equal members doing their jobs as equal

comprehensive discussion and votes on the budget as i listened to the comments on the subject of salaries it raised basically this one issue and that is should we try to plan all of the financial affairs of this country through the budget procr s in other words what i wondered was how did all of this budget system get started for instance let us review this subject of comparable pay we talked about comparability of pay back home we discussd it at great length 2 weeks ago and i was interested to learn back in texas that people working in civilian jobs wanted comparability in pay like the washington area they told me the highest pay in america is in farifax county va and montgomery county md and they kept saying why can we not get pay in our area up to their washington level now comparability is a real problem but we cannot solve it here in congress with 435 viewpoints i went back and looked up the background on how congress got started in this budget business because i was one who voted for this budget process i had been in business all my life and i thought now this is a highly desirable thing to do to draw up a budget because we can do two things when we draw up the budget if the members will recall this was the budgetary inpoundment and control act of 1974 it passed 401 to 6 everylody in congress wanted to see it work for two big reasons the first one was that we would get our budget done very early every year we would know exactly where we were going the first thing that this law mandated was that by april 15 of every year congress would have completed the budget that was april 15 now we are out here knocking on the door of june and we have not yet passed or gone to conference the second thing is they said we would be able to effect tremendous savings in cutting spending because by doing all of this planning that we would be able to do we would be able to make its operation much more efficient we would be able to cut spending everywhere i looked back then to see where we were in 1974 when we started this budget process congress was spending 270 billion i think 269 8 billion or something like that to be exact 270 billion we were spending at that time now we are talking about 750 billion so obviously the budget process was a complete failure in cutting spending or in planning now last night we were here in session until 1 oclock our group has been working we have all worked hard chairman jones the distinguished leaders on our side including the gentleman from ohio and so many have worked worked worked we were here until 1 oclock last night we have stayed on we have deliberated but what is the fallacy of the budget system well it is very obvious you cannot accomplish anything through a large committee i knew that when i vas in business you know that when you are in the government and the bigger the committee not only causes confusion you have complete chaos we have 435 members trying to work out the complete financial plans of america i was thinking about our situation and compared it to a football team because i love football when they have football games usually the quarterback calls the plays sometimes the coach calls the plays but i tell you if you had 11 men trying to run that team at the same time it would be just like this congressional budget a 435person committee is a certain complete and total disaster what we need we need to go back to fundamentals we need to go back to our basic committee system we have a good ways and means committee and they should work on taxes we have an excellent appropriations committee when i heard the gentleman from mississippi the chairman say that he thought it might be a good idea to strike the enacting clause i thought that is the most logical statement i have heard when we talk about education it ought to be done by the education committee and when we talk about commerce and business it ought to be done by those committees but to have 435 people think they can talk continously and come out with anything other than utter confusion or financial bankruptcy for america is beyond comprehension we do not need this budget our procedures provide that we can go
