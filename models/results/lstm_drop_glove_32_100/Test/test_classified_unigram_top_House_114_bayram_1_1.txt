all the orwellian names that the house comes up with for legislation this one is truly deserving of an award by the ministry of truth for those of you at home who have not been following the swirling madcap antics around the house of representatives lately let me assure you that the default prevention act in no way prevents a default the default prevention act in fact specifies that two categories of people get paid in the event that the congress does not raise the debt ceiling it specifies that private bondholders of unitedstates treasuries will get paid interest and it specifies that social security recipients will be held harmless they will get paid now at some level maybe that sounds attractive but everybody else that is expecting a check or a salary or some form of repayment by the united states government they are out of luck 1 4 million activeduty troops they are not in this bill as somebody who gets paid if the government doesnt raise the debt ceiling four million disabled veterans are out of luck under this bill one million doctors who today are providing medicare services to our senior citizens are out of luck sorry you didnt make it into the default prevention act cooked up by the republican majority this is a bill that stunningly and explicitly defines for the world tells everybody exactly how the unitedstates government intends to be a deadbeat who we are going to pay and who we are not going to pay and here is how we are going to be a deadbeat why would you do that what possible sense does that make there are all kinds of reasons why this is a terrible piece of legislation but let me just focus on two number one i hear constantly from my friends on the republican side of the aisle that everything creates winners and losers the affordable care act the exim bank you name it doddfrank creates winners and losers this bill very explicitly creates winners social security recipients and bondholders by the way who are these bondholders who holds united states treasury debt do you i will tell you who holds most of it china china does this is why on the democratic side of the aisle we have called this bill the pay china first act which is actually a much better description of what this act actually does than the default prevention act more seriously i worked in the capital markets for a long time there is no way to gracefully default on your debt to say oh we will pay interest we will pay social security but we are not going to pay soldiers we are not going to pay medicare once you tell the world that we do not intend to abide by our obligations the world loses its faith in the united states folks this debt ceiling is a fiction it is an absurdist fiction what do we get from it the debt ceiling has never prevented the accumulation of debt that happens because this chamber and the united states congress chooses to spend more money than it chooses to tax and bring in there are really only two ways to reduce the deficit and the debt you can tax more which nobody likes to do or you can spend less which it turns out that nobody really wants to do either because of course everybody in this chamber has the things that they want to spend their money on but the other guys stuff well that we are going to cut so we have the ultimate hypocrisy of saying we are going to tax too little and spend too much create a deficit but then we are going to vote on this magical thing called the debt ceiling that will allow us to say i am not raising the debt ceiling because i oppose spending it is absurd and you know what it leads to legislation like this we have seen this movie before pretty soon in the next couple of days grown men and women in this chamber are going to talk about maybe the treasury minting a

begin by agreeing with my friend on the other side on a number of areas i too have concerns about the process by which we operate and would have preferred a number of these items to come as my friend suggests separately but the reality is of course we are late in the year and late in the session we have got significant work to do and this i think is the best way to proceed it is worth noting that the conference report itself is a compromise the democrats and republicans were involved in putting that together and indeed this entire bill has considerable democratic support as we work toward a larger compromise on the omnibus itself it is also worth noting why we ended up in this situation frankly the appropriations committee in this house accomplished its workall of its workfor the first time in a long time early this year all 12 legislative bills passed through the appropriations committee six of them across this floor to suggest that anything has been done in the dark or in the back room frankly ignores that fact what happened was the united states senate chose not to allow any appropriations bills to come to the floor they didnt do that as a body my friends on the other side of the aisle in the senatethe democratschose not to allow any bills to come to the floor to be fair to them they also completed every appropriations bill through the full committee that is the first time that has happened in many many years in the united states senate but our friends until we got this larger agreement the budget agreement which i was happy to vote for and i know my friend on the other side also voted for until we reached that point the appropriations process in the other body didnt happen at some point that affects what is going on over here if they are not moving bills we stop moving bills because it is sort of a waste of time to do that if you have got complaints you should talk to your colleagues in the other body on your side of the aisle and tell them hopefully next year they wont try to keep bills from moving to the floor in a normal way again i am proud that this body moved all 12 bills through the appropriations committee i also want to make a couple of other points in terms of where we are now in trying to reach an omnibus this puts me a little bit again at odds with my friend i dont think that is a closed process frankly it is a pretty normal process there are representatives involved in these negotiations both democratic and republican and from the administration they are working very hard in good faith to try and do something that is extremely difficult writing a 1 1 trillion omnibus bill takes a lot of time and there are multiple items to be negotiated i think both sides are negotiating in good faith in this legislative body and i think the administration is participating in good faith my friend and i will also disagree that riders on appropriations bills as they are called is somehow unusual they certainly when they were in the majority had lots of riders on appropriations bills it is just not an unusual thing there is obviously giveandtake on these things but congress exercising the power of the purse is a perfectly appropriate constitutional tool to use in this case where we end up will indeed be a compromise the omnibus bill cannot pass either chamber and certainly has to be signed by the president of the united states a republican congress our friends with the appropriate tools and votes that they have the president of the united states who has the ultimate veto pen all of these parties will have to be placated again that negotiation is long and complex we are making good progress all parties are represented there eventually a bill will be presented to this body hopefully in the next few days i share my friends concern i would prefer not to be here but if we have to be here next week and have two or three more days to have the process work out so be it the lessons i think we ought to draw from this and that we have a chance to implement next year are lets do a normal process we already have an agreement now for next years spending numbers that is a step in the right direction and actually says a lot of good things about all parties and all concerned that they were able to come to this larger agreement earlier this year we have no excuse in my view not to move all 12 bills across the floor in regular order under an open rule so every member can come down here and participate i know that that is certainly the goal of chairman rogers the chairman of the appropriations committee i know that is the goal of his ranking member the distinguished gentlewoman from new york i think the hard work this year has set us up both for a fruitful compromise here in the waning days of the calendar year in the legislative session and has actually laid the foundation for something we have not seen around here in a long time regular order next year in the course of that regular order all of us will be forced to compromise we still live in a divided government a republican congress and a democratic president we still operate in a system of checks and balances that our constitutional forebearers set up over 230 years ago that system has served us pretty well over the course of our history i think it will continue to and it will continue to demand compromise we have seen a little bit more of that lately i know my friend has his concerns some of which again i share i am pretty proud of a congress that has number one produced the first unitary budget since 2001 where the senate and the house agree that for the first time since 2006 has moved all appropriations bills through the appropriations committee of both chambers that actually in recent days and weeks passed landmark legislation as my friend referred to the reauthorization of higher education act where i know he played a role in that the highway bill that was recently passed this conference report which i know my friend has some concerns with but in fairness speaks well of him and pointed out a lot of things that he liked in this conference report if we sit here and wait to pass things where we all get 100 percent of what we want nothing will ever pass the united states congress certainly in a bill this large when we reach the omnibus that is going to call for many compromises this bill before us has called for many compromises but people have found a way to work in good faith my friend is perfectly in order to oppose the rule that is a pretty normal position for each side to take minority and majority i never have any problem with that i think we will pass the rule i hope he looks at the entire bill the funding of the government and the customs act where he had some concerns but also had many things to point to that he thought were appropriate and good and the internet tax prevention that we now make permanent where i know my friend has worked very hard for many years to do that and yes there will be some things in this bill that he doesnt like there are some things in this bill that i dont like but i think if you look at the merits of it the permanent end of taxes on the internet the customs legislation that my friend very ably pointed out has many good provisions finally the essential operation of government for the next few days so people negotiating in good faith for both my friends party and my party and from the administration can actually arrive at a deal i think there is a lot of merit in the underlying legislation i would just ask that we be realistic again my friend is perfectly within his rights to oppose both these measures the rule and the final bill i certainly understand his concern about the rule if the roles were reversed my concerns would probably be similar i hope he looks to the underlying legislation when that vote comes and says there are a lot of good things here there is a lot of giveandtake by both sides there is real compromise we have done a lot of that in the last few weeks under speaker ryan i think we have the opportunity to do more next year lets pass the rule pass the underlying legislation get to finishing our business in the next few days hopefully give the american people what they deserve some peace quiet and certainty in the christmas season and then come back here next year with an

we voted on a similar bill years ago before i got into congress we gave this right and authority we gave it to the irs guess what the irs has the best tax compliance in all federal governmentwho would

federal income taxes in 2014more than 1 billion now there are lots of reasons people cant do that there are people who need to have their wages garnished and they are there are people who are disputing what the irs said again this bill doesnt affect those people the adjudication process continues on and this bill doesnt affect those people as a last resort we need a tool that the irs has for its employees we need that tool for the other departments and agencies because like it or not the law requires that we pay taxes five years ago president obama directed his administration to crack down on tax cheats it was specifically targeting and discussing contractors but i would argue that the same principle for contractors should be in place for federal employees how can you look the contractors and the employees in the eyes and say well we have got two totally different standards of principles the principle is the samepay your taxes and there is not a problem if you are in trouble and if you are trying to get out of it not a problem we will work with you yet for those of you who are just screwing over the american taxpayer byebye you cant even apply the president said all across this country there are people who meet their obligations each and every day you do your jobs you support your families you pay the taxes you owebecause its a fundamental responsibility of citizenship i totally and wholeheartedly agree the federal employee tax accountability act makes individuals with seriously delinquent tax debt ineligible for federal employment it is defined as an outstanding federal tax debt that has been assessed and may be collected by levy or court proceeding the legislation does not affect employees who are working to settle their tax disputes or resolving outstanding liabilities i want to also remind everybody that the committee and i as the prime sponsor accepted every democrat amendment that was offered100 percent several other safeguards are carved out in the bill including provisions offered by the minority in the previous congresses individuals are provided full due process rights and have an additional 180 days to demonstrate their debts meet one of the exemptions of the bill that was i believe offered by congressman lynch we accepted it we thought we would get broader support because of it and we would hope we would today the bill also provides a financial hardship exemption if the individuals service is in the best interest of the united states the person who is leading that department or agency still has discretion if he says it is in the best interest in my judgment for the united states to continue to have this person serve he is allowed to continue to serve the bill demonstrates a simple principle individuals collecting federal salaries funded by taxpayers have to follow the rules and pay their taxes those charged with the stewardship of our federal resources and programs should not be delinquent in their taxes as all americans file their taxes today so should federal employees and most of them doin fact at better rates than civilians do last month in testimony before the committee the gao warned congress of

emergency treatment for them when police officers have been trained in that we have actually seenand the police officers like this toothat they can quickly identify if this is a mentally ill person in crisis what they can do to deescalate the situation and prevent it from becoming harmful or deadly here is another point that has been written by amethyst lees first off the health system is horrible and i worked inside a mental institution and saw firsthand what it is like depending on where i was the people were not getting their needs met or were being ignored i even saw an incident where a man was waiting for 15 minutes for two staff members to stop talking about football just to ask for some ice he never got his ice because he lashed out for being ignored and of course he was restrained in a chair for an hour for getting angry marianne kernan writes with regard to cody miller talk to him our mental health system is shameful i know as i work daily with this population many times their treatment is inhumane some with dementia or alzheimers wouldnt be treated this way if they had a break with reality it is a sad commentary on our lack of knowledge of dealing with serious mental illness here are some more stories angie geyser writes my 13yearold daughter morgan was in police custody for 19 months before she finally received treatment for her schizophrenia we had to pursue a civil commitment to make it happen now she is back in juvenile detention where she has no access to the outdoors and is not allowed to have physical contact with her family the treatment of the seriously mentally ill by the criminal justice system is appallingly inhumane frede trenkle writes two weeks ago a stranger that i have been married to for 13 years came into my home sprayed me with pepper spray took a knife out in front of my two kids and threatened to cut his throat the police took him away and put him in a mental health hold i chose not to press charges and just requested that he get help this was his second hospital stay in a month the hold was supposed to be for 7 days four days later he got out and i am sure because he had a plane ticket out of the state he convinced someone out there that i was the threat he denied ever having a knife he manipulated the system i received abusive texts before i changed my phone number and he sent terrible emails i only wish he could get the help he desperately needs wherever he is but because of the unchecked mental illness i now have two beautiful girls without their father and both needing their own mental health counseling how do we help our system on all ends another woman writes if you want people like this young man to get help we all need to be okay with paying more taxes and closing privatized prisons the prison system has become the dumping ground for the pervasive mentally ill another one writes my uncle has schizophrenia he disappears for months at a time i worry constantly about him being hurt by law enforcement he was living 50 miles away in the woods on his fathers property in a camper and was threatened with a gun by a neighbor because he was walking in the fields talking to things only he can see the cops were called and they showed up with weapons drawn then they took him away and locked him up for a month he is only 32 but the police assumed he was on drugs he was having a psychotic episode there is not enough education in the judicial system about mental illness and innocent people are being killed through the ignorance another woman writes my question is this as the mom where should we direct the young people with schizophrenia hospital care is effective but it seems to be temporary 6 months in and 2 years out repeat has anyone found or used or heard of any successful treatment going on at treatment facilities the answer is yes actually one of the programs in h r 2646 the helping families in mental health crisis act is for something called raise recovery after an initial schizophrenia episode we have learned that since schizophrenia and bipolar illness and severe mental illnesses are emerging in adolescent and young adult years if one gets to someone early with a low dose of medication with proper evidencebased treatment the prognosis is much much better but when we dont treat someone every time someone has what the lay public calls a nervous breakdown or a psychotic breaka crisiswe have to understand that over time these lead to neurological damage these are not harmless episodes this is not just someone who gets upset this is a real psychiatric disorder that comes from the brain and leads to problems and that is why we see these problems grow here is someone who doesnt quite understand the problem a woman by the name of julie writes i am very much against the families of mentally ill patients having the power to put their loved ones away against a patients will let the doctors determine if the patient has a problem not the family often the family just doesnt want to deal with the illness so they want the person to go away someone by the name of robin duffey writes julie you dont know what youre talking about there are more of us that do care but because of the mental health laws we are unable to make decisions for very sick family members people with schizophrenia dont realize they are sick they think their hallucinations are real along with the commanding voices they hear so how can such an ill person make a logical decision to get the help they need the answer is they cant the doctors have to follow the laws that are in place which is they cannot recommend committing a person unless they are an immediate threat or danger to someone or themselves yes julie there are some families that dont want to be bothered but i was not one of them i highly recommend you to do research on the subject before you spout your ideas read the federal and state laws indeed that is what we are trying to do with h r 2646 there are a couple of thousand more comments on my facebook page and i certainly ask people to go and read them they are heartbreaking they are horrifying they are tragic they are true they go on and on because our nation refuses to acknowledge this until we pass this bill and start making changeswe can predict itin the time that i have been speaking here there have been several more suicides there have been more homicides there have been more mentally ill people whom we have abandoned there have been people who have had chronic illnesses and who have died because the people with serious mental illness for multiple reasons tend to die 10 to 25 years sooner than the rest of the population because of the fact that 75 percent of those with mental illness have at least one chronic illness 50 percent have at least two chronic illnesses and a third have at least three chronic illnesses i mean things like heart disease lung disease infectious disease diabetes they get sick and they oftentimes are not treated many times they dont seek treatment we let them go in this slowmotion death spiral and ignore them we have closed the hospitals we have put them in prisons if they are out of control and if the police bring them to the emergency room and if there are no beds available they tie them down to the gurney where they may wait for daysor weeks in some caseswhere they are perhaps given some sedativea chemical straightjacket if you willto calm them down that is not treatment that is abusive that is our nation that is doing it and congress is culpable in this because we refuse to act once again there will be a tragedy somewhere i shudder to thinkand i hope it is not anybody here who is injuredthat somewhere out in america today this is going to happen once again we will gather for a moment of silence the gavel will come down and we will go back to our regular order of business it is sad and it disgusts me but that is what we face all of this closing of hospitals and not opening up community mental health medicaids saying you cant see two doctors in the same day medicaids saying you cant go to a hospital with more than 16 beds hhs saying we cant tell parents anything so they are left in the dark the substance abuse and mental health services administration which funds programs that teach people to make collages to do interpretive dances to get off their medication to make masks and other things that have nothing to do with serious mental illness we need to change the system and that is what h r 2646 does it takes that office of samhsa and changes it so that the director of it is the assistant secretary of mental health and substance abuse that person needs to be a doctor or a psychiatrist who is trained either an m d or an osteopath or a psychologist but someone who understands the field and not just someone who is saying well lets just do these other feel good programs the city of new york just did this too where the mayor put up hundreds of millions of dollars for programs that were supposedly for the mentally ill they werent for the mentally ill at all they were programs like parks and bike trails and feel good programs to help people with sadness not to deal with depression and serious mental illness how long can we continue to fool ourselves as for this whole idea that says leave it up to them if they want to choose dont provide them the help make it the most difficult for those people who have the most difficulty all of this is more commentary and evidence of the grand experiment of stopping all treatment under the misguided selfcentered and projected belief that all people who are mentally ill are fully capable of deciding their own fate and direction regardless of their deficits and disease and that they have the right to selfdecay and selfdestruction which overrides their right to be healthy the most fundamental dangerous and destructive hidden undercurrent of prejudice is the low expectation that your disability is as good as it gets 2030 the shift to consider changes in how we treat severe mental illness is the pendulum that needs to swing the other way the grand experiment has failed in closing down all the institutions and care and stopping all treatment and not allowing community mental health it is a principle that operated under the misguided selfcentered belief that people are always fully capable of deciding their own fate regardless of their deficits and disease and the right to selfdecay and selfdestruction overrides this right to health in so doing we have come to comfortably advocate our responsibility to action and live under this perverse redefinition that the most compassionate compassion is to do nothing at all it further bolstered the most evil of prejudices that the person with disabilities deserves no more than what they are under that approach no dreams no aspirations no goals to be better can even exist indeed to help a person heal is a headon collision with the bigoted belief that the severely mentally ill have no right to be better than what they are and we have no obligation to help them this is the corrupt evil of the handsoff approach in the antitreatment model and that perversion of thought is embedded in the glorification that to live a life of deterioration and paranoia and filth and squalor and emotional torment trumps a healed brain and the true chance to choose a better life this is the movement of hatred and stigma toward the mentally ill disguised as the right to let them be sick that hatred may be embedded in our own anger our own resentment and ones own past experiences projected as blame or misattribution of the lives of others or maybe our own fear and loathing of the mentally ill either way the outcome is tragically the same so we can have more moments of silence or we can have times of action i hope the energy and commerce committee picks this up i hope that more members of congress will sign on as cosponsors of h r 2646 the helping families of mental health crisis act the day that bill signs into law it will begin to save lives it will begin to make a difference in peoples lives of all the other things we do down the road here for images or to push pollingi can tell you this that the polling on this bill is in 70s and 80s as politicians we think wow if something polls at 55 percent vote for it my concern is will america wake up and look toward congress here and say when we had a chance to do something to save lives did we act or are we once again just caught up in moments of silence thomas jefferson said something along the lines of indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just and his justice cannot sleep forever we are in that same position now we can either have the courage to stand up take action and help the mentally ill or we can sit in silence i hope this chamber soon takes up h r 2646 the helping families in mental health crisis act i yield back the

public that they have been able to see directly through what this iran agreement is about an interesting thing is happening on this floor as i sit around and listen i am hearing republicans and democrats on the same side those that are opposed to it are bipartisan those that support this all come from one place you know when i came to congress the one thing you are always told is find a committee and stick with that committee because what happens is you get expertise if you care about banking you go to financial services and you get expertise year over year taxes ways and means when it comes to foreign affairs you get the expertise of something like this so you know what i have listened to those who sit on those committees and i look to the chairman and the ranking member on the democratic side you know what i heard from both of them they are in the same position they are opposed to this agreement they took their years of expertise they read through it they did the hearings and they came to the same conclusion so i wonder could that happen on the other side of this building inside the senate because they have committees as well the same bipartisan conclusion came it just didnt even come from the committees the next democratic leader in the senate the number two is opposed to the iran agreement the american public always asks us for bipartisanship this has brought us together but it is not just in this house it is almost in the majority of houses across america you see in the latest poll only 21 percent of the american people actually approve the deal and 49 percent oppose that is more than 2 to 1 only 2 percent of americans are confident that iran will abide by the agreement why because they never have before 1l 1000 iran has a history of not living up to their promises it is clear today that what the president said he did not achieve just in april president obama said he will do what is necessary to prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon he said that he will implement this deal to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon he did the opposite in 13 years iran can have a nuclear weapon not just because iran wants it but america will say then it is okay thirteen years is not that far away that is not all that iran gets in this deal while we had sanctions on iran the only reason they wanted to come to the tablewhat did they do with their money even though it was scarce they didnt have much they funded terrorism around the world what does this deal do it gives them as much or maybe even more than the bailout that greece got what will iran become they will become the central bank of terror in the world that is what we are voting on today if you want to know the truth about the deal you go even further because there are side secret agreements we do not know on this side of the aisle we think we should keep with the law we think when 400 people on this floor voted for the corkercardin bill that said you had to have all agreements we felt when there were 98 senators and only one opposed that you would want to hold to the same agreement why would anybody want to vote on something without having all the facts especially after you read the reports that maybe iran can do selfinspection if that is the case why dont we bring to the floor and change the olympic committee and those athletes should be able to test themselves i look for the education committee maybe students should grade themselves maybe that is facetious but this is probably the most important bill you will vote on in your term in congress dont fall to political pressure because you dont need to the bipartisanship of the majority of americans stands opposed the expertise in this house that you respect regardless of what party you are in because you selected those members to lead those committees are opposed if that is not enough study history history always repeats itself have we not learned that peace without freedom is meaningless the president said he would not agree to any bad deal well i believe we can have a better deal history has shown chamberlain just wanted peace but history has shown other times in america where presidents have stood up and stepped back and got a better agreement ronald reagan wanted to end the nuclear weapons when it came to the soviet union in the end of ronald reagans second term he sat in iceland with gorbachev he sat down across the table and he got almost everything he had asked for but gorbachev asked for one more item he asked that america would end their sdi investment ronald reagan had a choice ronald reagan said no but he said i will do something even better i will provide you the technology as well so everyone in the world could be safe gorbachev said no that is a defining moment not for that man but for this world and ronald reagan got up and walked away some people criticized on a political basis but i ask you this would the soviet union have collapsed would the berlin wall have collapsed at the time it did had reagan not stood firm and asked and kept his word for a better deal peace without freedom is meaningless this deal does not bring greater freedom to the world it brings a nuclear missile race this is not just about america iran or a few other countries no country in the middle east will sit back after this action the world will not be safer we will not be freer but there is still an opportunity history has shown if we are willing to stand up take a step back and get a better agreement we can have peace and freedom"], [0.5969801545143127,

rule which makes in order 12 total amendments including 7 minority amendments and 2 bipartisan amendments both of these bills deal with easing the regulatory burden when it comes to the energy sector being from coastal alabama i have a great appreciation for the impact the energy sector has on our economy and i am a strong supporter of an alloftheabove approach to energy production unfortunately washington has a bad habit of putting up costly barriers that make it harder for the energy sector to grow and create new jobs today is about getting some of these barriers out of the way and unlocking our nations energy potential one of the bills the native american energy act would roll back the overregulation of indian lands and encourage energy development by indian tribes and alaska native corporations from streamlining duplicative federal processes to increasing tribal control over natural resource development this bill includes important reforms to unlock the precious energy resources on tribal land and to allow these tribes to take more control of their energy assets in fact a 2015 report from the government accountability office found that indian energy resources hold significant potential for development but remain largely undeveloped they remain largely undeveloped because the federal government is standing in the way this has resulted in lost revenue for indian tribes and it is time we fix this problem this commonsense legislation has strong support from tribes across the nation including the southern ute indian tribe the confederated tribes of the colville reservation the intertribal timber council the navaho nation three affiliated tribes of the fort berthold reservation in north dakota and the national congress of american indians it is time the federal government gets out of the way and allows tribal nations to manage their land how they see fit without the heavy hand of government getting in the way the second bill covered by this rule would end the outdated ban on crude oil exports the ban was first put in place in 1975 as a response to the arab oil embargo but it is clearly no longer necessary and it is tying our hands both economically and strategically around the world over the last decade the united states has become the leading producer of oil and natural gas in the world which is good news for the countless americans who work in the oil industry and it is even better news for the american economy there is broad bipartisan support for lifting the 40yearold ban on crude oil exports leading economists including former obama economic policy adviser lawrence summers and leading scholars at harvard university support lifting the ban former u n ambassador and energy secretary under president clinton bill richardson said that the unitedstates needs to export our oil and gas in order to help us geopolitically in eastern europe against russia recently 135 senior legislative leaders from 40 states and puerto rico sent a letter calling on congress to lift the ban the letter notes that the outdated federal export restrictions on crude oil and lng are detrimental to american workers our collective security and economic recovery in our states there were three signers of the letter from mr hastings home state of florida numerous editorial boards around the country including those at the wall street journal the washington post the detroit news the denver post the washington times and the houston chronicle have touted the benefits of ending the ban most notably 69 percent of american people support lifting this ban shouldnt we stand with the american people now lets talk about some of the benefits from lifting the outdated ban first it is estimated that this legislation would create 630 000 additional unitedstates jobs by 2019 lifting the ban would also benefit unitedstates manufacturers and boost our gdp second the congressional budget office estimates that lifting the ban would generate 1 4 billion from oil and gas leases over the next 10 years that is really a significant number third the government accountability office found that lifting the ban would lower gas prices by anywhere from 1 5 to 13 cents per gallon even president obamas own department of energy found that increased oil exports would help lower gas prices fourth lifting the ban will allow the united states to help our allies abroad for example russia has continuously used their control over oil to pressure european countries to comply with russias wishes if a country refused russia would threaten to cut off their energy supply by lifting the ban the united states can begin supporting our allies and in turn weaken russias grip on many european countries it is very interesting that this administration has worked hard to open up oil export capabilities for iran yet they are refusing to allow the united states to do so by allowing iran to export oil the president has essentially given the ayatollah a leg up in the global marketplace placing the strategic interests of iran over those of the united states this is yet another example of the president of the united states standing with the people of iran and the ayatollah and not standing up for the people of america these are four very clear benefits for repealing the ban and unlocking our nations energy potential now the white house has said they believe lifting the oil export ban is a decision that should be made by the commerce department not by congress so let me get this straight the obama administration would rather unelected unaccountable federal bureaucrats at the department of commerce make this decision instead of the democratically elected congress i think that speaks to a far larger problem with this white house and how they believe our government should work ultimately both of these bills are about empowering the american people and getting the government out of the way these bills both have broad support and i urge my colleagues to approve this rule lets move forward on passing these commonsense bills i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5957928895950317, 0.5957928895950317, 0, "it is always an honor to be able to speak on this hallowed floor a report was made earlier today entitled house poised to declare isis committing genocide against christians other minorities and in fact this report says the house is poised monday to approve a resolution that declares the islamic state is committing genocide against christians and other religious minorities in the middle eastputting even more pressure on the obama administration to do the same ahead of a deadline later this week the resolution passed the house foreign affairs committee with unanimous support and is expected to pass the house with bipartisan backing the resolution comes to a vote monday evening just days after the release of a graphic new report by the knights of columbus and in defense of christians on isis atrocities the report made the case that the terror campaign against christians and other minorities in syria iraq and other parts of the middle east is in fact genocide when isis systematically targets christians yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities for extermination this is not only a grave injusticeit is a threat to civilization itself representative jeff fortenberry republican nebraska said in a statement we must call the violence by its proper name genocide the resolution will be voted on ahead of the congressionally mandated march 17 deadline for the secretary of state john kerry and the white house to make a decision on whether to make such a declaration the measure is an effort to force the administrations hand on the issue as the administration has so far declined to take an official position christians yazidis and other beleaguered minority groups can find new hope in this transpartisan ecumenical alliance against isis barbaric onslaught fortenberry who is cochairman of the religious minorities of the middle east caucus and represents americas largest yazidi community said in the statement so the measure received the backing of the house republican leadership paul ryan calling on the obama administration to take action like recent attacks against christians the article goes on from foxnews com indicating it is rare for congress to make a genocide determination in addition to the genocide resolution the house is expected to vote on a measure to create an international tribunal to try isis members accused of atrocities it is pleasing to report that h con res 75 expressing the sense of congress that the atrocities perpetrated by isilthat is the islamic state and it has used different names isis isilagainst religious and ethnic minorities in iraq and syria include war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide that passed by 393 yeas and zero nays it is deeply troubling that although this house in a bipartisan way could vote 393 for this resolution and zero against that secretary of state john kerry and president barack obama are having trouble deciding what they should do gee is it possible they might just notice that in the house of representatives we came together unanimously and said what isis has been doing is genocide for heavens sake for the sake of the christians the yazidis the jews in the area is it too much to ask that this united states administration take notice that there is a genocide going on and though the administration is not doing much of anything about it is it too much to ask that this administration at least call it what it is that this house on both sides of the aisle unanimously said the same thing is it too much to ask even if you are not going to fight the genocide at least call it what it is then that will embolden others with courage to stand up and fight more fearlessly is that too much to ask i hope and pray not in the meantime what we find here at home while we are still having the administration struggle over whether to call genocide genocide we have a report from ice the immigration and customs enforcement ice it is revealed that 124 illegal immigrant criminals released from jail by the obama administration since 2010 have been subsequently charged with murder the center for immigration studies report on the data from ice to the senate judiciary committee added that the committee is not releasing the names of these masses of murder suspects the criminal aliens released by ice in these yearswho had already been convicted of thousands of crimesare responsible for a significant crime spree in american communities including 124 new homicides after the thousands of crimes they have already committed before ice released them inexplicably ice is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times said the report written by cis respected director of policy studies jessica m vaughan she added that 75 percent were released due to court orders or because their countries wouldnt take them back whats more her report said that in 2014 ice released 30 558 criminal aliens that is illegal immigrants in the united states who committed criminal atrocities who had been convicted already when they were released of 92 347 crimes wow as the world suffers as this administration cannot determine whether or not to call the genocide of christians and other minority groups genocide at the same time it has been hard at work out of those thousands tens of thousands of aliens who have committed over 92 000 criminal acts against americans here in this country the administration has been hard at work and deported 3 percent of the tens of thousands of aliens illegally here who have committed over 92 000 crimes and this administration has deported 3 percent 2130 so much for protecting americans against all enemies foreign and domestic this article from paul bedard says her analysis is the latest shocking review of obamas openborder immigration policy and despite the high number of illegal immigrants charged with murder the list doesnt include those released by over 300 socalled sanctuary cities and those ice declined to even take into custody she said that 124 criminal aliens released by ice between 2010 and 2015 were charged with murder during that period and associated with 250 different communities in the united states with the most clustered in california new york and texas i would assert parenthetically for those that are not california new york and texas you cannot think for a minute that this is not already in your state if you havent heard about it is coming this says in a memo about the subsequent crimes of released illegals to judiciary committee chairman senator chuck grassley ice said the aliens were charged with a total of 135 homiciderelated crimes subsequent for my liberal friends that means after to release from ice custody as of july 25 2015 a total of 39 convictions have resulted from these homiciderelated charges of the 121 total aliens 2 had homiciderelated convictions prior to release from ice custody ice released them knowing that they already had homiciderelated convictions and they were released to kill again upon the american public though they violated our laws to get here and they violate our laws to stay here this administration has seen to their release upon the american public further vaughan added that ice reported that there are 156 criminal aliens who were released at least twice by ice since 2013 between them these criminals had 1 776 convictions that kind of sounds patriotic since 2013 ice has released 1 776 criminals with 1 776 convictions before they are released in 2013 including burglary larceny you know those things that hurt america this article from cis org also says only a tiny percentage of the released criminals have been removedmost receive the most generous forms of due process available and are allowed to remain at large without supervision while they await drawnout immigration hearings they are permitted to take advantage of this inefficient processing even though they are more likely to reoffend than they are to be granted legal status further down it says some aliens had multiple zip codes associated with them in ices system so the records include more zip codes than the 121 individual criminal aliens charged with murder through 2014 three more were charged in 2015 ice did not provide their zip codes ice reported there are 156 criminal aliens who were released at least twice by ice since 2013 that of course was in the other article it goes on to say ice has previously disclosed that 75 percent of the homicidal criminal aliens were released due to court orders most of those would be immigration judges who sit at the discretion of the attorney general of the united states so perhaps people can let our attorney general know that they would like our attorney general to pick some immigration judges who might actually enforce our law instead of forgo the law so criminal aliens can commit more crimes against americans i know i understand there is so much going on it is difficult to deal with all these issues at the same time and that is why the administration is struggling so whether or not to officially say that the genocide going on in the middle east of christians and other minorities is actually genocide it is just taking so much brain power even though in here it was 3930 the administration right down on pennsylvania avenue here just cant decide if it really might be genocide or not in a separate communication ice provided a list of the countries that currently are uncooperative in accepting their deported citizens afghanistan algeria burundi cape verde china cuba eritrea gambia ghana guinea india iran iraq ivory coast liberia libya mali mauritania morocco sierra leone somalia south sudan and zimbabwe gee cuba it is a real shame that as this administration negotiated all the things that it was going to give to and do for cuba that they didnt apparently bring this issue up oh by the way the criminal aliens that you have had come into our country are coming back to your country because they are your citizens illegally in our country they are coming back to you like it or not apparently i guess maybe with all the concentration on whether genocide is genocide they werent able to remember to bring that up to cuba or to china in afghanistan one of my muslim friends who is a great leader there in afghanistan pointed out a few years ago when he was talking about the leverage that the united states has and should use to get afghanistan to do the right thing by its people and by the united states i said well why do you thinkthis was in a visit in afghanistan i said why do you think we have much leverage this is a few years ago he said do you know what our annual budget is for the government in afghanistan no i didnt know he said around 12 billion american dollars do you know how much of that the united states provides he said we provide about 11 2 billion of our 12 you provide most of the rest of it he said yes you have got plenty of leverage but apparently this administration maybe again they are so flustered in trying to decide if isis who has expressly indicated they want to wipe out all christians and they want to wipe israel off the map they are trying to decide if that means that is really a genocide so they havent had time to notice that we have massive leverage over the afghan government to get them to do the right thing and take back their criminal aliens that are in this country illegally and send them back and take them otherwise the 10 12 of your budget that we provide may not get provided anymore but again i know this administration doesnt want to offend people that are killing american citizens i get that it is special being that sensitive algeria china india iran i just cant help but wonder if before the president authorized 100 billion to 150 billion going to iran if maybe it occurred in someones mind do you know what i am going to save some american lives by forcing iran to take back the criminal aliens from iran that are not lawfully here in the united states i wonder if anybody in this administration maybe thought about that did they think about it and send the president the message and it just didnt get to the president or it didnt get to john kerry and they didnt think about it on their own gee do you know what we know iran has already said they are going to spend some of that 100 billion 150 billion on weapons systems on more terror groups like hamas and hezbollah yeah they have said that we are going to spend more money on all these things we knew that did it occur that that is bad enough that you are giving money that is going to be used to kill americans christians jews yazidis it is going to be used to terrorize the world maybe you could have helped american citizens out by saying and by the way before we release it you are goingand never mind that they violated the agreement over and overbut you iran are going to need to accept back the criminal aliens from your country that are killing and terrorizing americans in our country illegally did nobody think of that it is incredible just incredible americans are suffering then we get this report from cis org that 61 million immigrants and their children young children now live in the united states now most of those i think 43 million or so are here legally but it is worth noting that the number of immigrants and their children grew six times faster than our nations population between 1970 and 2015 from 1970 to 2015 our united states population has grown by 59 percent that is a good healthy growth in the meantime the percentage of immigration growth or the number of immigrants in the united statesfirst generation that is most all everybody here even native americans werent native probably at one time they have come across somewhere but firstgeneration immigrants who actually immigrated in with children that number has grown by 353 percent over that same period in many states the increase in the number of immigrants and their minor children from 1970 to 2015 has been nothing short of astonishing in georgia the population grew 3 058 percent whereas before that it grew from 55 000 immigrants to 1 75 million immigrants that is just in georgia so the immigrant level grew 20 times faster 25 times faster than the overall state population so thank god for immigration thank god for legal immigration that is but when we abandon the rule of law and dont give ourselves time to welcome legal immigrants into this country and educate themthere is a reason that they have to be educated and are supposed to learn our language and supposed to learn some history because there is a tremendous amount of responsibility that comes with the right to vote you need to understand how you say what ben franklin said was a republic madam if you can keep it you cannot keep a republic if you dont educate people that are coming in and who are foreign to the idea of the responsibilities of maintaining a republic you dont keep it you cant keep it on the wave of that came this editorial from dan hannan a member of the european parliament dated today apparently he spent part of last summer volunteering in a hostel for underage migrants in the south of italy he talks about the migrants that came in he says i have seen refugee columns before and they tend to be made up disproportionately of women and children of the boat people landed by the coast guard while i was in italy more than 80 percent were young men young men who i noticed took out smartphones when they disembarked and looked for wifi so as to tell their relatives how good it was he says official policy in europe is based on a misdiagnosis the migrants are treated as refugees and there is an implicit assumption that their displacement is somehow our fault in the weirdly narcissistic tradition of the left the west is simultaneously blamed for having intervened in libya and for not having intervened in syria but the lads i was working with in italy were from

gentleman for yielding and i particularly want to thank congressman gohmert for organizing this discussion on federal lands policy and for his highlighting of the federal footprint map you can find that at naturalresources house gov federalfootprint or just google federal footprint when you do you will have a complete picture of how much land the federal government owns and how much of your state and your community is affected it may surprise you for example the federal government owns just seventenths of 1 percent of the entire state of new york it owns just 1 1 percent of the state of illinois it owns just 1 8 percent of the state of texas but then go further west and you will see the reason for the western revolt the federal government owns and controls 62 percent of the state of alaska it owns and controls twothirds of the state of utah and 81 percent of the state of nevada in my home state of california the federal government owns nearly half 48 percent is federal land in one county in my district alpine county the federal government owns 93 percent of the land if you are not from one of the western states you need to understand what that means that is all land that is completely off the local tax rolls that is land that carries increasingly severe restrictions on public use and access which means it is generating very little economic activity to these regions and often federal ownership means that federal land use policies are in direct contravention to the wishes of the local communities that are entangled with it recently the natural resources committee held a field hearing in north las vegas at the request of congressman cresent hardy now if you have ever flown into las vegas you know how vast are the empty and unutilized lands of nevada stretching as far as the horizon yet the local leaders there all complained of how the regions economy suffers from a great shortage of landland for homes and shops for businesses and infrastructure what an irony and what a commentary about the harm that is being done by the decisions of our federal land managers more than a century ago we began setting aside the most beautiful lands in the nation for the use resort and recreation of the american people that was the wording of the original yosemite land grant that was signed by abraham lincoln in 1864 but somewhere along the way public use resort and recreation became look but dont touch and the federal government became indiscriminate and voracious in the amount of land under its direct control as i said my congressional district is in the heart of the sierra nevada common complaints from my constituents and from local government officials range from abusive federal regulatory enforcement to inflated fees that have forced families to abandon cabins they have held for generations exorbitant new fees that are closing down longestablished community events road closures and the arbitrary denial of grazing permits for family ranchers who go back generations on that land a small town in my district that is trying to install a 2 million spillway gate for their reservoir was just given a 6 million estimate from the forest service just to relocate a hiking trail and a handful of campsites let me relate one quick story of what it means to be entangled in this federal morass that came to me from the sheriff of plumas county which is just outside of my district an elderly couple goes horseback riding near their home they come across an old horseshoe the wife picks it up and an ambitious young forest service official saw her pick it up the next thing they knew six armed federal law enforcement officers descended upon their home they tore it apart and ultimately prosecuted this elderly couple for removing the horseshoe charging them criminally with stealing from the federal government ultimately the federal judge dismissed the charges and chastised the officials who were responsible for this travesty but only after this couple had gone through hell ask yourself how your local economy would fare if the federal government owned 93 percent of the land in your county forbade or greatly restricted any economic activity on it and ignored the pleas of your local city council or county board 1830 in my district the federal government consigned our forests to a policy of benign neglect we now have roughly four times more trees per acre than the land can support in this overcrowded and stressed condition the trees can no longer resist the drought and beetle infestation today an estimated 85 percent of the pine trees in the sierra national forestthat is adjacent to yosemite national parkare dead and i am talking about christmastreeinjuly dead just waiting to be consumed by catastrophic fire the national park service estimates it is facing more than 12 billion of maintenance backlog yet we keep adding to the federal holdings that we cant take care of now that is why the federal footprint map is so important to understand and why fundamental reform of our land use policy is of paramount importance now the federal lands subcommittee has three principal goals to restore public access to the public lands to restore sound management to the public lands and to restore the federal government as a good neighbor to those communities most impacted by the federal lands but overarching all of these imperatives is the simple fact that excessive federal land ownership in the west has become a stultifying drag on our economies and a direct impediment to our ability to take good care of our public lands i thought congressman gohmert put it best in a subcommittee hearing we held almost 2 years ago now when he compared the federal governments land use policies to the old miser whose great mansion has become the town eyesoreovergrown with weeds paint peeling roof dilapidated broken windowswhile the old miser spends all of his time and money plotting how he can buy his neighbors land there needs to be a proper balance between federal ownership state and local stewardship and the productive private ownership of the lands one look at the federal footprint map should warn even the most casual observers that we have lost that balance and that we need to restore it i again thank the gentleman from texas for organizing this time today and for yielding time"], [0.5866193175315857,

to go to conference with the senate on the national defense authorization act the resolution also provides for consideration of a conference report related to our efforts to combat the opioid crisis that is wreaking havoc in communities all across the united states i want to talk first about the need to get to conference with the senate on the national defense authorization act for 54 straight years the house and senate have come together to fulfill our most important responsibility to provide for the common defense my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk a lot about regular order well there is no greater example of regular order than the national defense authorization act this legislation has gone from the subcommittee level to the full committee to the full bodies of both houses and now we need to continue the process by allowing for this house to enter into negotiations with the senate between the house and the senate hundreds of amendments have been adopted to this legislation members from both sides of the aisle have had an opportunity to have their input on this legislation and the separate bills passed both by the house and the senate have bipartisan support now there are some differences between the house and the senate versions of the national defense authorization act and that is why we have to have the conference committee process this will allow us to iron out our differences as a member of the armed services committee i can personally attest to just how important it is we get a strong reformbased ndaa signed into law this year our military is in the midst of a readiness crisis aircraft cannot fly due to maintenance issues there are even reports of mechanics having to take parts off of planes inside museums in an effort to repair damaged aircraft think about that for a minute the united states home to the greatest fighting force on the face of the earth is having to use plane parts from museums in an effort to keep some of our aircraft operational that is simply stunning and readiness is so important these days given the serious threat posed by radical islamic terrorism every morning it seems we wake up to reports of another attack whether it is in bangladesh baghdad istanbul kabul saudi arabia or right here in orlando or san bernardino these attacks just reinforce the fact that radical islamic terrorism must be defeated the ndaa is also important because it is a great opportunity to put reforms in place at the pentagon whether it is reducing bureaucratic obstacles improving military health care or updating the command structure the ndaa is the perfect tool to ensure efficiency and effectiveness from the pentagon so i hope my colleagues from both sides of the aisle will join me in voting to get us to conference so we can keep the streak alive of passing a strong ndaa each year the other portion of this rule provides for consideration of the conference report dealing with the opioid crisis i recently heard a story of a young man from southwest alabama who suffered an injury playing sports he was prescribed opioidbased pain medication by his doctor but unfortunately he became addicted next thing he knew his addiction had spiraled out of control and he found himself using heroin ultimately he became seriously ill thankfully this young man was able to enter a treatment program and receive help but not everyone who suffers from opioid addiction is so fortunate studies show that approximately 46 000 americans die because of a drug overdose each year that number adds up to over 130 deaths a day tragically young americans are disproportionately impacted one of the worst things about opioid abuse is that it can start so innocently whether it is a high school athlete who suffers an injury or an individual who undergoes a medical procedure as simple as dental work no american is immune from this tragedy that is why this legislation is so very important it authorizes new programs and reforms others to ensure that those struggling with opioid addition can get the help that they need the bill includes new grants to states to carry out comprehensive opioid abuse responses with education treatment and recovery efforts and prescription drug monitoring programs the bill also has multiple provisions dealing with prevention including a new intergovernmental task force to identify review and as appropriate determine whether there are gaps or inconsistencies between best practices for chronic and acute pain management treatment and recovery are also a priority with reforms to multiple existing grant programs and a new grant program to provide grants to community organizations to develop expand and enhance recovery services and build connections between recovery networks including physicians the criminal justice system and employers the bill also helps women families and veterans this includes reauthorization of a grant program for residential treatment for pregnant and postpartum women who have an opioid abuse disorder and a new pilot program to enhance the flexibility of funds so states can more broadly support familybased services for pregnant and postpartum women and their children moreover this bill contains other commonsense reforms such as clarifying that pharmacists coordinating with a doctor and patient may not fill the entire amount of a prescription for a schedule ii substance such as opioids these are just some of the numerous and important pieces of this legislation i am pleased to report that 200 different organizations from every corner of our country have already come out in support of this conference report now this bill probably doesnt do everything that every member would like for it to do in my time up here i have yet to see a perfect bill but this is a good bill and i honestly doubt there is anything in this bill that my colleagues disagree with i understand some of my colleagues have concerns over funding but let me remind my colleagues about the important distinction between appropriations and authorizing this bill authorizes programs to address the opioid crisis the appropriations committee has made clear that they are going to do everything that they can to provide funding for these programs and i take them at their word but putting funding in an authorization bill is not the proper way to address this issue i worry we are seeing a larger issue here that started with the zika virus legislation a few weeks ago my colleagues on the other side demand action on issues the process plays out the house and senate work together on legislation and then my colleagues on the other side announce their opposition to very similar bills to the ones they previously supported lets not forget that the house passed our opioid legislation by a vote of 4005 and the senate passed their bill by a vote of 941 neither of those bills included funding so it is stunning that now many of my colleagues on the other side say that they are going to oppose this bill i worry that this is about politics instead of policy i fear that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want an issue to debate on the campaign trail instead of actual solutions to the problems facing our country i sincerely hope that that is not the case because the american people deserve better than that they can turn on their tvs every night and get enough political theater but here in this body we should rise above that temptation and actually work on solutions the minority will not get everything they want that is the nature of compromise and that is the realty of being in the minority but this has been a truly bipartisan process and i hope it will not fall victim to political grandstanding i urge my colleagues to support

of me and my colleague congressman scott garrett who is my republican cochair of the payer state caucus which is a group of members opposed to the massive transfer of wealth between one set of states to another this amendment is a very simple one that would prohibit any of the funds in this bill from being used in the experimental program to stimulate competitive research otherwise known as epscor epscor was started in 1978 as an experimental program in the hopes of strengthening research infrastructure in areas of the country that receive less than their fair share however defined as a scientist and as an american i think this goal is commendable but the implementation of this programand in particular the formulas used to earmark grants to a specific set of statesis absurd the ability to participate in epscor opportunities is based solely on whether or not a state has received less than 0 75 percent of the nsf research funding in the previous 3 years let me reiterate that the department of energys epscor eligibility is determined by how much nsf research funding a given state has received in the previous 3 years there is no rational basis for earmarking a grant program in one area of spending based on the spending in another unrelated program moreover because epscor considers the funding on a perstate basis rather than on a per capita basis it has devolved into just another one of the many programs that steers money into states that already get far more than their fair share of federal spending epscor is emblematic of a larger problem we have in this country every year hundreds of billions of dollars are transferred out of states that pay far more in federal taxes than they receive back in federal spendingthe payer statesand into states that receive a lot more federal spending than they pay back in taxesthe taker states in the case of illinois our economy loses 40 billion a year because we pay far more in federal taxes than we receive back in federal spending as for my colleague from new jersey his state on a per capita basis has it even worse this alone is responsible for the fiscal stress in both of our states this is an enormous and unjustifiable redistribution of wealth between the states this amendment takes a first small step to begin rolling back these taker state preferences by eliminating one of the manybut one of the most unjustifiable of themthe epscor program i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
