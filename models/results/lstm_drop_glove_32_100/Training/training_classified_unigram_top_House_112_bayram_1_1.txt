bill sometimes you have to call it what it is so thank you congresswoman sheila jackson lee for joining us this evening i listened to new york times columnist tom friedman yesterday and i think we ought to put his talk on with the one that he had with our nations governors on dvd and make it required listening for some of our stonewalling colleagues he put an adjective on the debate or socalled negotiations that have been staged these last few weeks he called the debate idiotic now some may agree some may disagree with that but he further said and this i do agree with that it is not worthy of our country and a disservice to our children so just like the other 74 times since 1962 74 times that a clean noncontroversial lift of our debt ceiling has been done we should have done it a long time ago and thats what we ought to do now and then after that whether we use bowlessimpson or rivlindomenici or whats left of the gang of sixi guess it is now just democratstheir plan is a starting point we need to begin coming up with a solid deficit reduction plan that isnt done on the backs of our poor our middle class our children our seniors and our people with disabilities and one that is as the president has called for one of shared sacrifices its the only fair way its the only american way and while important to securing the future deficit reduction by itself is not enough we are still in a recession a recovery but its very slow and its uneven what we need now are jobs jobs and more jobs we need to continue the work of the recovery act and add to the 3 million jobs that we either saved or created with that bill and that act we need to rebuild our manufacturing base as the make it in america democratic agenda would do and we have to revive the housing market to help families stay in their homes and restore the opportunity for every american and those who came to live in this country to achieve what we call the american dream we need to do what we have always done

the most difficult since the great depression one of the results of this recession has been an increase in hunger families who have lost their jobs or have seen their incomes reduced because of the economy have had a difficult time putting food on their tables its common to see families who once volunteered at or donated to local food pantries now stand in line for food from these very same nonprofit organizations unfortunately these organizations have had difficulty meeting the demands theyve faced over the past few years the good news i suppose is that the new usda report shows that fewer people were food insecure in 2010 than in 2009 the bad news is that there are still 48 8 million americans who struggled to put food on their tables last year frankly these numbers are unacceptable its unconscionable that even one person in this country goes without food let alone 48 8 million people it breaks my heart that 16 2 million of these hungry people are children thats

westville indiana was shot and killed while on patrol by a local afghan security contractor who had been hired with six other colleagues to guard a nearby construction project and road the construction project and the security contractor were funded by the unitedstates department of defense while the shooter was immediately apprehended and would later admit to the shooting and be sentenced to 15 years in prison by an afghan court i am deeply troubled by the fact that insufficient contract oversight by our government may have lead to this tragedy according to ncis documents obtained by the birchfield family through a freedom of information act request the seven afghan guards taken into custody were found in possession of five ounces of opium and some of them were presenting symptoms of opium withdrawal several of the guards admitted that they had little to no training and most of them stated they had none of the permits required for their jobs their employer a subcontractor providing security for the project admitted his employees were not properly licensed and that he did not know where he was supposed to obtain licenses last month the department of defense confirmed to me that the project these security guards were subcontracted under was funded by unitedstates funds known as commanders emergency response program funds or cerp it appears clear that proper oversight of these security contractors paid by our government did not happen these private security contractors were operating without the licenses that are required of private security contractors in afghanistan they were not properly trained and several of them were drug users i cannot say that had there been better oversight by our government this tragedy would have been avoided but we owe it to our service men and women in harms way to get this right i believe dod must significantly improve their oversight of private security contractors according to the congressional research service right now the dod relies on 19 000 private security contractors in afghanistan a force equal to almost 20 percent of all unitedstates military personnel in that country not only is the ratio of armed contractors to unitedstates forces higher in afghanistan than it ever was in iraq where we had many more troops 95 percent of the security contractors in afghanistan are afghans a much much higher reliance on local security contractors than iraq meanwhile the performance and reliability of afghan security contractors is spotty and continues to be if we are going to continue to rely on local security contractors in afghanistan we must make oversight a top priority and that means ensuring that rigorous oversight on the ground is getting done the congress and gao have been critical of dods security contract oversight for years in the 2008 ndaa congress directed dod and the state department to prescribe regulations for the use of private security contractors in an area of combat operations by may of 2008 in 2009 gao recommended specific steps that dod implement to satisfactorily comply with congress directive on security contractors including the screening training equipping and oversight of contractors currently the gao considers all of these recommendations as either only partially implemented or not implemented at all further the dod has acted to try to improve oversight but the fact is i dont think they are focusing enough properly trained personnel on oversight maintenance many contract officers are not even in the same country as the project they are responsible for managing and often the responsibility for on the ground oversight falls to a service member designated as a contracting officers representative cor whose primary responsibility likely has nothing to do with contracting and who may have had only minimal contract oversight training before arriving in the field dod needs to do more than come up with plans and guidance they need to ensure that sufficient personnel who are adequately trained are in place and actually doing their job especially when the contracts involve paying and arming afghan security personnel in a theatre of combat my amendment to h r 1540 does two things which i believe are crucially important but also should not be difficult for dod to comply with first my amendment directs the secretary of defense to establish a quality assurance surveillance plan which would set uniform standards for contract oversight plans for all private security contracts funded by dod in afghanistan and in any future contingency beyond just ensuring that paperwork is in order all security contracts would require a plan clearly laying out an oversight strategy and designating sufficient personnel to exercise necessary oversight to ensure contract performance and reliability second my amendment directs the secretary of defense to designate a single official in the country of operations with the responsibility of reviewing private security contracts to ensure compliance with the quality assurance surveillance plan further this official must certify that they have reviewed the oversight plan for a security contract that the oversight plan is appropriate for that contract that there is an appropriate number of appropriately trained personnel available to oversee that contract and confirm that any and all licenses and permits required of a security contractor and its employees have been reviewed and verified as current and authentic the congressional budget office has reviewed my amendment and has advised me that it does not affect direct spending or discretionary authorizations mr chair if we have the time money and resources to bid and hire private security contractors and

rests uneasily with democratic theory for this reason a critical feature in our democracy is to control excessive bureaucratic discretion and to ensure that rules and regulations promulgated by federal agencies are consistent with the intent of congress as expressed in the law the administrative procedure act apa of 1946 exists for this purposeto constrain excessive bureaucratic discretion through procedural requirements for agency decision making including setting goals and standards for regulations and ensuring public participation through notice and comment other statutory rulemaking requirements applicable to a wide range of agencies include the regulatory flexibility act the paperwork reduction act the unfunded mandates reform act and the information quality act these statutory requirements established a clear process for agency rulemaking and standard by which the quality of regulations should be measured i appreciate the concerns of my republican friends that there are problems with many federal regulations over the years we have seen evidence of excessive bureaucratic discretion that result in federal regulations being too burdensome costly counterproductive and even prohibitive critics argue that mundane requirements have led to the ossification of the rulemaking process which at times could mean years before the final regulations are put in place meanwhile federal regulations are derived from the laws that are enacted by congress these laws are put in place to safeguard public interest without federal regulations though we could have situations such as

have been raised about this pipeline and try to clarify some of the facts about whats going on with this type of product and this type of pipeline a lot of people think this is a brand new product theyre worried about product from oil sands in fact according to the congressional research service there are already five other pipelines that are bringing this product from canada to the united states in fact for years this product has been coming to refineries in the state of utah where im from and refined in refineries in north salt lake the most recent of those five pipelines that brings this product from canada was actually approved by the obama administration in 2009 it brings 800 000 barrels a day from canada into the united states and when that project was approved by the obama administrations state department the state department said that the pipeline would send a positive economic signal in a difficult economic period about the future reliability and availability of a portion of united states energy imports and in the immediate term this shovelready project will provide construction jobs for workers in the united states now when it comes to the keystone proposal as it was going through 3 years of environmental review when discussing this pipeline secretary clintons coordinator for international energy affairs david goldwyn stated balancing jobs and energy

that the president likes to call obamacare but there are massive taxes already ahead in law for the american people many of which were just now becoming aware of i guess thats what happens when you dont read the bill before you pass it but every single american will see their personal taxes already go up and thats before we get to whatever happens with the fiscal cliff this is an arbitrary acrosstheboard tax increase the combination of which will mean that if we are unable to resolve the fiscal cliff without raising taxes well already see a lot of new taxes as a result of the health care law on financial transactions on insurance programs on every single working american thats why we have speaker john boehner trying to present president obama with an alternative that says rather than raising taxes which is already going to happen on january 1 from this massive new tax increase that was in the health care bill why dont we find a way to understand and have the economy take that in hand first i know the president stood here at the state of the union address and said were not going to spend one dime of taxpayer money i know the president stood here and said every single american can keep their own insurance plan i know the president has made these promises to the american people and these are the things that were going to have to understand about january 1 of next year i believe thats why we need to have john boehner be successful and the president to make sure we avoid further tax increases because we already have a massive tax increase thats going to take place this would in essence be a double whammy on not just a fragile economy but an economy that is in far worse shape with a country that is far more in debt and much more at risk today so you and i understand the cbo has estimated some 2 million american jobs would be at risk because of the obamacare implementation and its massive impact on the freeenterprise system and taxation combined with what would be this newif the president gets his waytax increase on working americans and in particular small business while much has been made about the debates surrounding tax rates there is i think a larger picture that we need to consider we should focus on employment and jobs instead of trying to necessarily aim for fairness just by using this weapon against small business we should focus i think on job creation we understand that if the presidents bill passes we will lose 700 000 jobs that means 700 000 americans and their families would then qualify i presume for unemployment and it would mean that we begin the new year once again on a negative pathway thats why we are here today talking and trying to have our leaders of this great nation make sure that we avoid this this country is in desperate need of an economic kickstart lower taxes we believe through stimulating job creation and job investment and by stimulating the economy will allow all americans not only to keep their jobs but also to keep more of their own hardearned pay in fact president john f kennedy i think agreed with us when he said it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to increase revenues in the long run is to cut rates now thats exactly where we are republicans are arguing not to increase taxes at a time when the american economy is struggling when families are struggling lets not ask them to go into their pockets and pay more to a government that simply wants to spend more of this money my republican colleagues and i remain

development and we were able to put a man on the moon that was a great day for the united states of america when we did put a man on the moon now were in a situation where our space program needs to move forward we have a lot of issues that we have to deal with in our space program and the main reason for that is that if you control the skies you basically control the world space and satellites are so important to what we do not just from an intelligence point of view getting the information taking the pictures dealing with all sorts of communications these are things that we do in space and we have to keep moving ahead we have to get our younger generation graduating from our colleges to continue to go into space and the big threat there is china and russia china is putting billions of dollars into space their goal is to go to the moon and it is our concern that if they do that we have to be with them there we have to continue our research and development and we have to be vigilant

russian federation the distinguished chairman has provided a clear description of the provisions in this bill that grant permanent normal trade relations or pntr to the nations of moldova and the russian federation it is fairly straightforward simply put after 18 years of negotiations russia joined the world trade organization in august that membership will require russiafor the first timeto play by the same rules of trade as the united states and virtually every other nation in the world but under wto rules the united states cannot take advantage of russias wto membership unless and

any unitedstates law as a result of russias wto membership other than this change to the 1974 trade law this is in contrast to bilateral free trade agreements where the united states is required to provide dutyfree treatment if that were all there was to h r 6156 it would pass or fail along familiar lines of traderelated legislation but h r 6156 will become known as a landmark piece of trade legislation not because it grants pntr for russia and moldova but because it includes title iv the sergei magnitsky rule of law accountability act of 2012 let me share with my colleagues just a little bit about the life and death of sergei magnitsky in whose honor this section of the bill is named after exposing the largest tax fraud in russian history tax lawyer sergei magnitsky was wrongly arrested and tortured in a russian prison six months later he became seriously ill he was denied medical attention despite 20 formal requests on the night of november 16 20093 years ago tomorrowhis condition became critical instead of being treated in a hospital he was taken to an isolation cell chained to a bed and beaten by eight prison guards for 1 hour and 18 minutes which resulted in his death sergei magnitsky was 37 years old he left behind a wife and two children those responsible for his abuse and murder have yet to be punished and sadly he is not alone his story is emblematic of corruption human rights abuses and impunity in russia since the death of sergei magnitsky the human rights situation inside the russian federation has continued to deteriorate russias parliamentary elections last december were marked by mass protests over alleged electoral fraud since vladimir putin was reelected president in may of 2012 his government has taken a harsh and confrontational approach to ongoing protests cracking down on the russian peoples growing discontent with corruption and creeping authoritarianism russian authorities have used excessive force to break up peaceful demonstrations and detained and raided the homes of opposition leaders russian civil society has also been a target of increasing repression beginning in june and with astonishing speed the russian duma passed a series of draconian laws that restrict freedom of expression freedom of association and freedom of assembly many observers fear that these laws will be used as a political weapon to stifle criticism of the government they make it harder for russian civil society to operate effectively and create a climate of fear and selfcensorship civil societys sense of isolation is only compounded by the russian governments recent decision to expel organizations like usaid from the country in addition journalists and human rights activists continue to face grave dangers in pursuing their work just last month tanya lokshina with the moscow office of human rights watch received a series of threats to herself and her unborn child most likely in connection to her efforts to expose impunity for human rights abuses her experience is not unique while russian authorities have tried to silence critics ngos and independent media the world is still awaiting justice for many violent attacks on dissidents and journalists i would like to note for my colleagues that today at 2 the tom lantos human rights commission will be holding a hearing on human rights in the russian federation and ms lokshina will be one of the witnesses in this context the story of sergei magnitsky remains especially important at a time when the human rights situation in the country is going from bad to worse it is all the more important to hold russian human rights violators accountable the sergei magnitsky rule of law accountability act which is title iv of h r 6156 as reported by the rules committee places an asset freeze and visa ban on those individuals responsible for sergei magnitskys torture and death as well as on russian officials engaged in corruption and gross violations of human rights this is beyond just sergei magnitsky these measures provide a degree of accountability and reinforce the administrations toolkit to respond to crimes by individual government officials passage of the magnitsky act sends a clear message to the russian people that we support their fundamental human rights importantly it also sends a strong message to those russian officials who support the rule of law and who reject corruption and human rights abuses it lets them know that their efforts and their achievements are valued by the united states and the international community
