behalf of representing his constituents from the great state of arkansas tonight as a fellow blue dog member i want to echo a number of the comments that congressman ross has made because in that 12point program that congressman ross will talk more about i believe lies solutions to the problems facing our nation today solutions that come to the heart of criteria and qualities that all americans i think share those are accountability competence and what kind of representation they want to see in their house of representatives it does not matter what party you are a member of in this great nation of ours accountability and competence are characteristics that americans value throughout our great land in coming to the congress as a new member and becoming a fellow blue dog we have had an opportunity to share and really spend a great deal of time in examining the challenges that our nation finds itself in in getting its fiscal house in order recently the blue dogs in consultation with a lot of research uncovered an unpublicized department of treasury document that made a report that i think most americans unfortunately are unaware of this department of treasury run by this administration using the same tried and true accounting methods that every business in america uses cast new light on the fiscal severity that our nation is facing what some would call a mess this treasury report filed by the bush administration reinforces what the blue dogs have been saying for years one of the startling revelations of this 158page report indicates by the admission of secretary snow that the unitedstates deficit as congressman ross said under current accounting methods in 2005 was more than twice the amount that is being reported as a matter of fact if you do not take into account as congressman ross jut stated the social security surplus our fiscal deficit ladies and gentlemen is over 700 billion today and yes we pay the interest on that debt every day but do not take my word for it look at the financial report of the united states government because it goes on to say that in fact in conjunction with the unitedstates comptroller that there is no way ve can get a clean audit from the books of most of our federal agencies why because no one is being held accountable congressional leaders are not conducting the oversight hearings that we should do as a part of our responsibility as members of congress and so frankly we do not know what the true state of our budget is because so many of these agencies have not been able to provide the proper audits in a letter contained within this report in this report david walker the comptroller general of the united states explains that the model currently used by government provides a potentially unrealistic and misleading picture of the federal deficit its overall performance the financial conditions and what the future outlook will be for future generations of americans to come the financial report makes it very clear that if we got into honest budgeting today that in fact we would find ourselves with a much larger deficit than we have today it goes beyond that to say that in fact if you looked at all 26 agencies in the federal government that is on page 23 here and you asked them for a clean fiscal audit that over twothirds of them would not be able to provide that clean fiscal audit that obviously is not the kind of condition that americans want their federal government to be in that is not the kind of operation and management that provides for the true fiscal accountability and the competency competency remember i said accountability and competency are characteristics that american taxpayers care about they are values and characteristics that really make a difference so what we have today is not just a problem with accountability but it is competence it is not just the problems in the aftermath of katrina and rita with fema but it deals with a budget deficit it deals with a budget deficit that has been compounded by a trade deficit that has grown by 1 400 percent in the last 4 years in 1992 our trade deficit was over 36 billion 2005 our trade deficit has grown to over 670 billion along withit i might add a lot of american jobs that have been exported overseas let me close my comments by telling you that as a new member of congress i had served previously for 24 years in the california legislature i think i did not come back here to washington with any pollyanna view of the world but i also believe very passionately in representative democracy when it works well and when it does not work i have just recently finished reading a book that i want to recommend to americans back home it is called flight club politics it is an accountability of what has occurred in the house of representatives over the last 15 20 years it did not begin with the republicans it involved the democrats in the late 1980s and 1990s and notwithstanding the republicans efforts to pledge to reform the house in 1994 when they took over the fact of the matter is as the evolution of this flight club politics how partisanship is poisoning the house of representatives has unfortunately in my opinion only multiplied the problems that we now have exist today we no longer have a system of checks and balances under the republican leadership during the clinton administration there were over 1 000 subpoenas of the administration e 2030 now one could argue that the congress was doing its part to provide checks and balances unfortunately by comparison under the last 5 years with the republican administration there has been less than 10 subpoenas requested of this administration to hold them accountable regardless of what department or agency you are talking about when you have a view of the world that the only legislation that we can bring to the floor of the house must first pass with a majority of the majority you are taking away the opportunity to have true bipartisan solutions and it is one of the reasons i believe why today in america one of the fastest growing views of voters in america is decline to state or independent so regardless of what party one must be registered under people more and more view themselves as independents what we have to do today and in the future is to restore bipartisanship to this congress the blue dogs believe in that we have to reinforce the opportunities that we dont need a de facto parliamentary system where there is less focus on checks and balances and one party basically runs the entire government those are among the many challenges that we face today my colleagues i am proud to be a member of a group of moderate to conservative democrats who frankly believe that we must first get our fiscal house in order how do we do so we do so with true accountability we do so with competence in terms of how our federal government is run and we do so by ensuring that our house restores

tax cuts to the level they were at in 2001 for income over 200 000 if someone makes more than 200 000 they get all the income tax cuts up to the 200 000 but no tax cuts after 200 000 again we spend 167 billion less deficit than the republican budget creating 27 billion less in interest payments now we have heard all of this about massive cuts in defense let us be very clear all of the numbers on defense are exactly the same numbers as the republican budget with one exception we fund missile defense at 1 billion rather than 8 8 billion if you look at defense homeland security and veterans that

federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight

independent here at home last week as we were looking at rising gasoline prices all across our country he suggested that we import import more ethanol i thought about that comment and his whole administrations lack of attention to energy independence for our country and i sort of sat there at my desk and thought why would the president behave this way and i thought a lot about how we form our personalities and when we take whatever occupation we get into as adults why we behave the way we do there are some personalities that result from experiences that make you selfmade and then there are those personalities that i call derivative personalities and their behaviors result from a different set of experiences so when they get in a job they really cant command and direct because they have never really done it themselves here is an example i grew up in a family where our mother made our clothing we didnt have a lot of money so we learned how to scrimp and we learned how to invent and to create and those are learned skills the president grew up in a family that was extraordinarily wealthy i would guess that they bought most of their clothes in fact i can remember when the president his father didnt even know how much socks cost in the store during one of his presidential races they always bought everything they never made they had enough assets he inherited enough that they really didnt have to learn how to be selfmade so he doesnt have a mind that lends itself to creativity necessarily we came from a family where we ran our own small business our dad made his own products we made our own sausages our own meatloafs our own pickles dad had to do everything himself he had to figure out how to finance his business we have a president who inherited his wealth everything that he did he had this soft landing pad he faileda number of times in businesses that he inherited from his own family but he never really paid the consequences because someone was always there to catch him and to refinance him even in the purchase of the baseball team that he owned which then he e ventually sold and used those dollars to get elected pr esident of the united states mkost american families dont have that kind of landing pad in our family we had to earn our way to go to college and we had to get good grades because there was nobody there that was going to save you nobody in our family had ever gone to college before i had to keep good grades to keep a scholarship up for the scholarship i did receive but the presidents education was paid for by his family in fact he was admitted to schools based on his grades that most americans could never get admitted to i think what these kinds of experiences do is create a different kind of personality a personality of people who are selfmade and they know how to create versus a personality that is more derivative and sometimes cant solve problems and they look to someone else to solve them so if we have an energy problem in america the president would look to somebody else and he says well lets import the ethanol he doesnt really think about creating a whole new industry here at home and using the government of the united states to help create that industry that is why he has proposed cutting programs at the same time out of one side of his mouth he talks about energy addiction but then is trying to use the government of the united states to create a new energy future for america he really doesnt know what to do with it when he is in command of it it was actually congress that adopted the first energy title to a farm bill it didnt come from the administration and if you look at every single budget that he has offered he talks about energy independence and then he cuts the programs that would lead us in that direction what america really needs is a new biofuels industry as a complement to other forms of power that we can create but we need selfmade people to help move america in that direction many of our farmers are figuring it out we need programs to help them finance the development of the new infrastructure and the production facilities that are necessary to green up this industry they need the presidents help to do it so they are not bought out by big oil and by companies that really dont want them to bring up this new industry but the president really doesnt know how to create it his secretary of agriculture isnt doing it we could have programs like title ix in usda funded at 1 billion we struggle to even get 25 million or 23 million in our committee which is laughable in terms of a trade deficit in oil of over 60 billion and counting the presidents cabinet members are not energyfocused the secretary of defense said energy isnt his job he runs the largest instrument in this country that uses fuel and energy independence isnt his job he said that to us in committee we need people in our country and the presidency and this congress who are selfmade not

on the other side of the aisle who do you think you are kidding do you not think the american public is watching what you have done just this morning usa today reported on our nations dire fiscal conditions quoting experts on both sides of the aisle for example the newspaper said to hear comptroller general david walker tell it the united states can be likened to rome before the fall of

occupied the white house i would suggest to my colleagues there is one person and only one person in america that can stop spending in its tracks and that is the president of the united states no single member of congress no single member of the senate but a president can say no to spending so when presidents lament spending they lament what they have done here is the reality mr speaker in every single one of those 17 years this country has had substantial deficits let me repeat that 17 years of republican leadership and 17 straight years of deficits the republican budget reconciliation bill would only perpetuate that record of irresponsibility and recklessness why because the net effect of their reconciliation package would add 20 billion additional deficits in this country five years ago the bush administration and this republican congress inherited from a democratic president a 10year budget surplus of 5 6 trillion and four consecutive budget surpluses from the clinton administration i call your attention to this chart budget deficits fiscal year 1982 the first fiscal year for which ronald reagan was responsible to fiscal year 2006 which is the current year we are budgeting for look at that 17 straight years of republican deficits with no exception now the republicans come to the floor and they say oh my goodness we have had iraq we have but when ron ald reagan said it was good morning in america when he said the economy was doing extraordinarily well and that america was back and had an overwhelming reelection based upon that premise guess what we had a deficit of 212 billion the next year we had a deficit of 221 billion so the deficit picture you see on this chart is unblemished straight deficits until bill clinton is elected president of the united states then bill clinton as you can see on this chart introduced an economic plan on this floor and i will get to that president bush had promised the american people that he would proceed with tax relief without fear of budget deficits even if the economy softens you will see he was dead flat wrong so when you hear these republicans make representations about what they are going to do look at the 17 years ronald reagan said he was going to balance the budget he did not do it george bhush the first said he was going to balance the budget he did not do it the present president of the united states said we can adopt his economic program and we would pay off the national debt we would not spend a nickel of social security and we would not spend a nickel of medicare he was wrong or i might say he misrepresented politely every one of those points and has run up deficits of 157 377 412 319 and 323 billion that record is one that ought to be rejected democrats have been united in rejecting those proposals we will continue to take that posture at the same time republicans have raised the debt limit not once but twice not three times but four times in four years 450 billion in 2002 984 billion in 2003 800 billion in 2004 and 781 billion this year the interest payments on the national debt are now the fastest growing category of spending in our budget so today when republicans say

reduce it even alan greenspan the chairman of the federal reserve is sounding the alarm recently he said you should not be cutting taxes by borrowing fortunately not all republicans are willing to participate in this irresponsible fraud last thursday for example senator voinovich told the washington post i do not know how anyone can say with a straight face that wheh we voted to cut spending last week to help achieve deficit reductions we can now then turn around two weeks later to provide tax cuts that exceed the reduction in spending that is beyond me and i am sure the american people

plan was not adopted in the middle of night on the last day of the session without notice to the public and without hear ings the senate plan as the other side and as the sponsor of this measure have pointed out the senate plan has been in place for months by all means we should carefully consider an appropriate severance plan for our employees but we ought not to do it in the middle of the night

are not generous humanitarians aiding their fellow man many of theseillegal immigrants are beaten robbed and even raped before they even reach the mexicounitedstates border yet they keep paying the coyotes enough money so that these smugglers have access to sophisticated arms weapons gps equipment and high quality mobile radios many of them have better equipment than our own border patrol agents

to do almost anything even walk for mile after mile in the desert they think they can go into america and get a pay to stay permanently maybe they can maybe they cant his assertion about the immigrants belief rings true as we look at the facts on immigration in 1986 the immigration reform and control act granted amnesty to 2 7 million illegal immigrants and now today we have 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants seeking amnesty two years ago president bush first announced his guest worker program and illegal immigrant numbers have risen steadily since a survey conducted by the border patrol in 2004 revealed that of those illegal aliens in custody of the border patrol 45 percent were influenced to come to the unitedstates by the promise of amnesty the immigration bill we passed in the house directly strengthened legal recourse against these coyotes and focused on securing our borders increasing the number of border patrol agents and enforcing the immigration laws that we currently have these are essential steps that must be taken before any form of immigration reform has a hope of succeeding and the american people agree in a recent zogby poll 64 percent of respondents preferred the house bills approach of enforcement first and only 30 percent preferred the senates approach of amnesty additionally 73 percent of respondents had little or no confidence in the ability of our government to screen out terrorists or criminals if there is a mass amnesty for those 12 million illegals already in this country and yet the pressure is mounting in favor of this unpopular and impractical proposal there are some journalistic groups that have even begun to object to the use of the word illegal when referring to these immigrants we are supposed to refer to these individuals as quote undocumented or even the other extreme proposal to call them economic refugees but calling breaking tlhe law by any other name does not make it less of a crime according to theimmigration and nationality act it is illegal to enter the united states illegally it is illegal to smuggle human beings into the united states for a price and it is illegal to knowingly hire and aid a person you know entered our country illegally another central issue with immigration reform is to ensure that those waiting and hoping to enter this country will be treated fairly many of them

permits the embassy was a 3hour commute away for them as they had no transportation they had to walk but they told me they were happy to do so for the simple chance to come into the united states many legal immigrants have to wait 5 10 sometimes 15 years before they get their final approval to immigrate to allow those who bypassed all the rules and snuck into the unitedstates amnesty and a path to

grandchildren in a sea of red ink since 2000 the amount that government spends annually per household has risen froi 18 000 to over 20 000 in 2004 this is only the fourth time in our nations history that spending exceeded 20 000 per household it also represents the largest expansion of the federal government since the vietnam era the federal debt now stands at a staggering 7 8 trillion or roughly 26 600 for every man woman and child in america and the nations financial challenges are about to get markedly worse over the next decade without reforms we know that medicare will grow at a rate of 9 percent medicaid 7 8 percent and social security at 5 5 percent a year far outstripping our countrys economic growth or our ability to pay for them where will it all end f 2045 according to the gao if we ignore the runaway growth of government spending we will have to double taxes double taxes on our children and grandchildren just to balance the budget by the year 2040 if this occurs we stand to become the first generation of americans to leave our children with a lower standard of living not to mention a legacy of limited freedom and unlimited government now day after day member after member comes to this floor to decry the federal deficit and the legacy of debt that we are leaving our children rarely have so many of us spoken so passionately against the federal deficit and yet done so little about it today i wish to provide us with an opportunity to change that in 1970 the fundamental principle of postal reform was established that the postal service would become a selffinanced entity according to title 39 of the unitedstates code postal rates shall be established to apportion the costs of all postal operations to all users of the mail simply put the unitedstates postal service is supposed to pay its own freight but according to the congressional budget office and i understand that the chairman of the full committee respectfully disagrees with their score the cbo says h r 22 will actually place us further in debt by almost 6 billion over 10 years and who should pay for that 6 billion it either must be paid by those who use the postal service or the taxpayers i vote for those who actually use the service now some of my colleagues have argued that the postal service faces unique responsibilities and thus taxpayers must subsidize them it is true the postal service does have some unique responsibilities but they also enjoy a host of unique benefits that private businesses do not the postal service pays no federal states or local taxes they are immune from most regulations such as zoning motor vehicle registration and even parking tickets the postal service can borrow from the treasury at belowmarket rates and is immune from antitrust laws despite the fact that it can compete against private compianies the number one problem facing the united states postal service is not the lack of a taxpayer subsidy it is their seeming inability to control costs labor costs consume 80 percent of the postal services revenue whereas ups and fed ex spend only 56 percent and 42 percent of theirrevenues on labor the postal service has been unable to close existing facilities or consolidate new operations in fact over half of its 38 000 facilities do not generate enough revenue to cover their costs again i want to state that i respect the hard work that the gentleman from virginia and the gentleman from new york have done on this bill and i do understand that many different opinions had to be reconciled to get a postal reform bill to the floor but i believe that we need to stand with president bush we need to stand with the american taxpayer and make this a budgetneutral bill instead if we want to make the postal service more cost competitive what we really need to do is enact all of the presidential commissions workforce reforms in 2003 congress decided that the postal service was on a course to possibly overpay its civil service retirement system costs rather than let the postal service spend the money it retained it and an escrow account was created within the unitedstates treasury h r 22 releases that escrow account to prefund postal service health care liabilities i agree this is a sound use of funds but it is unfortunately incomplete under h r 22 only twothirds of the funds would be used to fund the health care liabilities letting 2 to 3 billion a year slip back to the postal service for other expenditures with the postal service currently facing an unfunded health care liability of roughly 75 billion i believe every dollar in the escrow account should be used to offset this growing concern if not taxpayers will surely be called upon to make up this tremendous shortfall my amendment would reduce the cost of h r 22 substantially by ensuring that 100 percent of the civil service retirement system savings will be directed to the postal services unfunded health care liability in addition this amendment would maintain the postal services financial responsibility for paying the civil service retirement system costs associated with military service credits instead of passing the cost on to the treasury and the american taxpayer again the question is not whether but who will pay the customers that use the postal service or the american taxpayers i want the postal service to become more efficient and i believe we can do so by enacting more of the presidents initiatives let us not pass the buck to american taxpayers yet again let us not pile further debt upon our grandchildren let us

and file employee pension plan is severely underfunded this important provision will prevent corporate chieftains from escaping via the golden parachute when an employer carries a qualified pension plan that is 60 percent underfunded or more after all the average working man in rural georgia deserves nothing less than a corporate executive in new york and while h r 2830 includes important

responsibly funding plan benefits union leaders are equally responsible for misleading their workers and pushing for unrealistic benefit increases knowing full well an employers plan is already

more precise in its stated goals and make plans to achieve them in a time frame that negates the perception we are involved in a permanent occupation of iraq the sharpest criticism of this resolution is that it would if implemented give insurgents in iraq information that is helpful to their cause and harm ful to our troops this is a reasonable concern which we address by not setting a precise time for exiting iraq the critics though infer that the enemy should never have any hint as to our intentions yet as we prepared to invade iraq the administration generously informed the iraqis exactly about our plans to use shock and awe military force with this information many iraqi fighters anticipating immediate military defeat disappeared into the slums and hills and survived to fight another day which they have one could argue that this information made available to the enemy was clearly used against us this argument used to criticize h j res 55 that it might reveal our intentions is not automatically valid it could just as easily be argued that conveying to the enemy that we do not plan an indefinite occupation as is our stated policy will save many american lives but what we

and a generator then converts it into electricity in the lumber and paper industries wood scraps are sometimes directly fed into boilers to produce steam for their manufacturing processes or to heat

in the freedoms we enjoy the freedom to meet in this chamber the freedom to reflect upon the great decisions that have been made here through the generations the decision to enter into a war to provide freedom and the maintenance of our union the decision to free peoples in europe and ultimately preserve our security at hom on december 7 1941 president roosevelt stood in this chamber and declared that december 7 was a day of infamy he shared that this unprovoked attack which moved the united states to war eventually into europe as well in the korean war we stopped communist aggression in vietnam the american 13eople responded during operation desert storm the american people responded in this chamber in september of 2001 president bush responded to an attack that was not brought about my friends by some nebulous global war on terror i think it is important that we understand this war is not about some nebulous terrorist concept this is about islamic extremism that chooses to impose itself on the world these people who largely act as agents of states these nonstate actors do not follow the teachings that they purport yet if we look more deeply we see that they are seeking to be true to their interpretation of that religion in every generation there is a call upon that generation to defend the freedoms that have been purchased at such a tremendously high price to maintain the union of our country and to free those who were enslaved cost 600 000 soldiers in world war ii 444 000 soldiers gave their lives to provide freedom and now we are engaged in a great struggle a generational struggle that has been imposed upon us i think that it is important that we understand that the freedom that our minority leader had today to say frankly entirely inappropriate things about our national leadership the freedom that all of us have to disagree the freedom that all of us have to offer alternatives the freedom that all of us have to protest the freedom that reporters who sometimes distort the truth and in fact in many cases do not even report the truth but fabricate it all comes down to the men and women who have answered the call to duty it is always the same it is always the minority in the country that does that those who believe that there is something bigger in this country than individual selfishness and covetousness of the moment that tiere is something worth risking all to protect because of those who come behind us because they understand they are part of something bigger than themselves bonded to something of greatness i want to thank tonight those marines of the second marine expeditionary force the soldiers of the third infantry division the solders of the 101st infantry division of the 173rd airborne brigade in afghanistan of the tennessee and louisiana national guards who are rotating back into the united states and all of those soldiers who are moving in and out the marines who are moving in and out our airmen and sailors who support this effort because you understand that you have accepted the call of the generations that is so important that many people do not realize the freedom we enjoy in this chamber was brought to us by 10 percent of the population of this country who chose to rebel against tyranny and stand for a principle that was higher than dignity of the individual the rights and freedom of the individual and that was purchased not simply in a declaration but to getto the constitution that gave us the government we have today was purchased in a great price in blood i am convinced that if todays cynical media had to cover the normandy invasion the greatest invasion in history that defeated the greatest tyranny in history up to that point had it been reported by todays media todays cynical media todays profitdriven media i believe we would have lost that war because the nation would have called for a pullout because there was risk associated with that because things did not seem to go well because when unforeseen circumstances that always come up in war and anybody who has served in the military let alone in this chamber unexpected things happen i find those who have not served who are the great experts on military history do not really understand what they are talking about rather than commending our soldiers who have adapted to a fluid situation and the great things that have been done to support them they provide criticism of why could that not have been anticipated it is simple my friends we are fighting an adaptive and motivated and frankly evil enemy that has a religious doctrine that stands and flies in the face of everything on which this country was founded on which the constitution was based that respects the rights of the individual the dignity of a man the dignity of a woman to pursue opportunities in the way in which they define and when somebody wants to impose an attack upon this nation and one that was planned long before september 11 and attempts that were made long before september 11 we have no choice but to yield or to respond and we have responded comments that have been made by my colleagues on the other side that talk about casualties i can speak with some authority on that issue having buried some of my friends i find it interesting that they want to talk about numbers which dishonors those who serve i did not see any of my colleagues who talk about these numbers standing with me as i buried a friend of a friend who was killed in al qayyim in june over at arlington cemetery they were back here at pac fundraisers and going to receptions and making pointless statements in this chamber about things they know nothing about more than that i would suggest to you that these same people who want to talk about numbers and these liberal reporters who do not care about this nation who do not care about the price that was paid for the freedoms that they enjoy where were you for the last 25 years where were you when 16 000 american soldiers died between 1983 and 1996 in service to this nation where were you when 24 000 american men and women gave their lives between 1980 and 2004 your comments frankly are despicable dishonorable uninformed unhistorical antiintellectual and frankly unamerican but i respect your freedom to make those statements because they were purchased with the blood of all of those who served i would suggest that in this body that the liberal reporters who watch and our enemies who watch and the soldiers who watch and those who want to speak against this from their positions of ignorance and political convenience who use our soldiers you learned your lessons during the vietnam war now you use our soldiers in a aishonorable way as human shields to advance an idea that stands in contravention to the freedoms that have been purchased at such a high price i ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have been here for many years and like to speak with false authority where were you when my friend ken maddock was killed from task force 160 where were you when my classmate from west point mike scott died where were you when lee border died or brian haller died in the 101st airborne division i saw no requiems in this chamber i saw no requiems on television for them it was not politically expedient but now you disagree with the policy when our nation is threatened by extremists and soldiers and marines and airmen and sailors have responded to that call and you sit here mouthing your empty words casualties are always a great tragedy i think the one thing that was most poignant to me as i visited my old airborne unit i deployed to the middle east with the task force of the 1 508th running aviation operations in support of them and i went and visited that unit today in paktika province in afghanistan a cnn reporter came to one of the forward operating bases there had been an attack on that base earlier in their deployment as they were clearing out the enemies of freedom and not simply ending a military operation but bringing order and civil government and roads and sewers and the fact that the government can be good and the people can be helped and they can be part of something bigger than themselves which is not a tyranny an ideological tyranny that reporter was looking for bad stories and refused to cover the reenlistment of every soldier in the 1 508 on that forward operating base who was up for reenlistment that is a tragedy and that is unfortunate to me i think the lesson that we have to ask ourselves is how do we get around this how do we avoid this problem well the media is not going to be helpful to this country because i think they have lost their connection with the heartland of this nation with the people who have borne the burden of the price of freedom through the generations every generation of my family has served in the armed forces not in glorious ranks of generals and admirals but in the enlisted ranks carrying the rifles and manning the ships that provided the freedom for the people in this body to say the things that they have said and i would say this i do not care about the media what we need to do is allow these soldiers and these marines to go into every editorial board into every rotary club and chamber in this nation and let them tell their story let them tell their story in the communities and in the fiscal courts let them tell their stories in the courthouses and on the street corners and i guarantee you that these people who purport to be experts on things they know nothing about will be discredited and things will be shown for what they are because you cannot refute a 100 percent reenlistment rate in units where these soldiers have borne this burden and they go back over and over again to you military people who are watching i want to say thank you as a fellow soldier to you who cherish our freedoms i thank you for you in the press who enjoy this freedom but you abuse it know that the price that is paid by those who frankly have greater moral character than you who refuse to cover the truth of what they are doing know that it is their sacrifice not yours that allows you to share what you share and finally to those of our citizens in the heartland know that these men and women are doing a great service to prepare the way for us to adapt to the 21st century that we will have a safe country and a community to pass these freedoms on to the next generation i will leave you with a story from the 1 508 commanded by colonel tim mcguire as he was moving northward from shirana fdrward operating base to orgune he shared that coming back from that mission a little boy ran from a village up to his convoy he stopped he did not speak pashto and the interpreter asked the little boy what the problem was the little boy had waved as many of the children i saw in afghanistan did at the americans all the time he asked the little boy what he was concerned about and he said that two bad men had come into the village and put something in the road that little boy saved potentially american soldiers the enemy were dealt with and that village is open and free but colonel mcguire asked the question which encapsulates all of what this struggle between radical islamic extremism and the values of freedom and dignity of the individual that we cherish expresses and he said young man why did you do that knowing that there was risk associated with what that boy did he looked at this airborne colonel in the 173rd airborne brigade and he said to tim before you americans came i could not go to school that is the contrast that we have here freedom opportunity hope true faith or extremism persecution tyranny and hatred thank you for you who

effort to provide states with greater flexibility as they begin to implement education reform initiatives edflex addressed criticism that certain federal education requirements stymied local education reform and allowed local school districts to apply to waive select education requirements in exchange for greater flexibility the local school district must demonstrate improved academic performance twelve states were grantededflex authority in 1999 ten states continue to have the authority colorado delaware kansas massachusetts maryland north carolina oregon pennsylvania texas and vermont s 2363 would extend edflex for these 10 states until congress reauthorizes no child left behind by extending this authority for these 10 states local school districts in these states will not have to interrupt the measures they currently have in place in maryland this includes allowing school districts that receive title i funds to allow all the students in the school to take advantage of title i

previously had access to these services but due to shifts in school populations these schools were no longer eligible for these funds even though the need still existed i am pleased that states have been responsible in approving waivers requested by theschool districts states haveadhered to the law which prohibits certain waivers such as those affecting civil rights and maintenance of effort

allow states to waive compliance with a highly qualified teacher provision in no child left behind all states must be in compliance with this provision by the end of this school year the highly qualified teacher provision is critical to improving student academic performance all children should have the benefit of a teacher who is certified in the subject area they teach the highly qualified

completely arbitrary that have been shown to be ineffective at reducing crime and a consummate waste of taxpayer money but that is not the only reason thanks to mandatory minimum sentences almost 10 percent of all inmates in the federal and state prisons are serving life sentences an 83 percent increase since 1992 in two states new york and california 20 percent of the people in prison are

to include funding to provide for the videotaping of interrogations of detainees in unitedstates custody now as members of this house know i have before the house a bill that would if enacted require that all interactions between detainees at guantanamo and similar facilities and unitedstates personnel be videotaped videotaping interrogations would not only help deter any claims of actual or

routinely videotape interrogations for precisely these reasons it is a powerful and effective tool for protecting both the iifterrogator and the one being interrogated additionally videotaping interrogations would ensure that the maximum possible intelligence value is gained during and after the interrogation sessions if analysts and linguists have the chance to review videotaped interrogations they have additional opportunities to evaluate both the quality of the information gleaned from the interrogation but they will also be able to look for body language and other clues
