thats good news we need legislation that will help expand exports and bring a greater degree of fairness into international trade we want a bill that will produce net benefits for our farmers our workers our industries and our consumers as we pass this legislation however we should recognize that there is no one simple cause for the trade deficits that bring this bill to the floor today and we should recognize that some of the solutions we may propose carry dangers of their own including the danger of trade wars that could boomerang against american exporters this is not a question of who wants to protect american jobs or who wants to create fair competitive trade conditions i want to reach those goals and i am sure that every other member wants the same thing it may be necessary in reaching for those goals to move farther toward a tough stance on trade conditions than we have gone in the past i want to make it as clear as possible that i favor any action we can take to move toward fair trade conditions if other countries discriminate against american products or use unfair tactics in our american market i am going to support every practical and responsible step we can take to level the playing field i do not want to export any more american jobs and i do not want american farmers and workers penalized by unfair foreign subsidies in other world markets i think we all agree that if our goals can be reached by negotiation with our trading partners that is the best course but if we need to take stronger action let us take it i think we all agree that persuasion is better than confrontation but if the only way to deal with an unfair foreign trading practice is to throw a rock at it let us throw it what i want to avoid however is a policy of throwing boomerangs that circle back and hit our own people i ask the house to remember that our goal in this trade bill is more jobs for american workers more markets for american exporters including farmers and more income for all americans we cant reach that goal if we create retaliation against american products and destroy american markets this is a trading nation we must keep that in mind when we design our national policies it may be necessary at times to take action against a trading partner that does not treat us fairly that was done recently in the case of japanese electronic products and i am sure the house knows that we have some severe problems with japan in the field of agricultural trade but the best answer to these problems is to take such trade actions with discretion and judgment to take them at times and under conditions that will produce net benefits for america as a trading nation we dont want a cycle of import barriers retaliations and counterretaliations that produces a downward spiral in world trade that would not be good for american workers american farmers american business and industry or american consumers when we consider the case of japan for example we ought to remember that in spite of our problems with their current trade policies japan is a gaint customer for the american farmer when we look at current problems i am very strongly opposed to japans policy of banning imports of rice that policy costs american farmers very heavily in terms of lost potential sales and it costs japanese consumers very heavily because they have to buy their staple food at an artificially high price i am also strongly opposed to the way japan limits imports of american citrus and beef and i hope that the day is coming soon when we can get something done about those quotas at the same time i think we should remember that ever since 1964 japan has been our biggest single customer for american farm products according to agriculture department figures japan buys the product of 14 million acres of american cropland every year that adds up to more cropland than they have in japan itself over the past decade our american farmers have supplied more than 90 percent of japans soybeans half of its wheat and twothirds of its feed grains what we want to do with japan under these circumstances is to find a way to improve our mutual trade balances in all products we want countries like japan to buy more american products that would be good news for american farmers businessmen and workers and it would be good news for japanese consumers and taxpayers what we dont want is a cycle of retaliation that would include a japanese cutback on imports of american products including american farm products this is not an easy call to make we have to find ways to make our trading partners understand that the united states wants fair trading terms conditions that are fair to americans and to other producing and trading nations one reason the call is not easy is the fact that we have not really analyzed in depth all the causes of the trade deficit that we are trying to deal with unfair policies in some foreign countries are certainly a factor in our problem but they may not be the only part of the problem we need to look at the question of whether some of our troubles may be due to other factors to factors arising from policies of our own solving the international trade problem will not be easy it involves complex issues of fiscal and monetary policy international exchange rates the unitedstates budget deficit and the steps we take to reduce it over time and the policies other nations follow to deal with growth in their own economies all those factors go into the equation in that connection i notice that a highranking advisory committee to the prime minister of japan has recently delivered a report recommending a farreaching program of economic adjustment a program to move japans economy from primary dependence on exports to a system driven by domestic demand full adoption of such policies could go a long way toward easing the problems we are trying to deal with today all of these things should be considered as we move on to implement the legislation the house will adopt today we should remember that we are dealing with friendly nations and trading partners of long standing we should remember that there are two sides to every trade policy problem as we face our friends abroad with our new policies we must remember that faults on both sides may have contributed to bringing us to where we stand today we must recognize that what we are doing today may deal with the immediate issue but it may not deal completely with the basic root causes of our loses in exports and domestic jobs some day in some way we are going to have to solve those problems and i hope we can do it in friendly cooperation with our friends around the world in summary our overall national trade deficit is far too great it must be brought down and it cannot be brought down unless our trading partners take actions that may be difficult for them in many cases but we also need policies that will give us the opportunity to meet the longterm needs of our country and not merely satisfy immediate apparent gains i very respectfully hope that i have laid out a possible road map for our deliberations on this so important piece of legistationhaving said this please allow me to recite the position of the agriculture committee two years ago the committee on agriculture wrote a new farm bill the food security act of 1985public law 99198which included an extensive trade title we are just now realizing the positive effects of the trade policy formulated by that bill this trade policy together with other changes made in domestic farm programs at that time is allowing the united states to meet the subsidized competition of some of our trading partners in agricultural commodities and products and to see a modest reversal in our declining share of world trade in major agricultural commodities while this trend is encouraging further steps must be taken to improve our position in world trade agricultural trade which has long been a positive factor in our balance of trade account has fallen considerably over the last few years exports have dropped from 43 8 billion in 1981 to 26 3 billion in 1986 last year for 3 consecutive months agricultural imports exceeded exports providing the first negative trade balanceexcept on two occasions when strikes at unitedstates ports hindered american exportsfor the agricultural sector in over 30 years from fiscal year 1981 the peak year in unitedstates agricultural trade to the present exports have dropped by more than 40 percent while imports have climbed by 16 percent over this same period our trade balance plummeted 77 percent the effect of this drop is adverse not only to our farmers and ranchers but to the overall unitedstates economy as well agriculture accounts for 18 percent of the unitedstates gross national product and nearly 21 million jobs and 1 million workers are employed in the production of agricultural products for the export market alone economists now estimate that each 1 billion decrease in the level of exports causes the loss of 35 000 agricultural jobs and 60 000 nonagricultural jobs based on this estimate the loss in farm exports over the past 5 years has displaced over 595 000 agricultural workers and over 1 million positions in the general economy similarly agricultural imports have an effect in reducing unitedstates employment it is estimated that in 1984 imported agricultural products totaling 19 billion cost the unitedstates economy about 1 7 million jobs and over 30 billion in economic activity it is also worth noting that total assets in farming and agribusiness today account for more than 50 percent of the combined assets of the manufacturing retailing and wholesaling industries in the united states in 1986 farmers spent almost 130 billion on production expenses nearly 75 percent of which was spent off the farm while farm trade is of major importance to the health of the entire unitedstates economy it is critical to the survival of the unitedstates agricultural sector in 1981 farm exports comprised a record 30 percent of total farm cash receiptstwice the level of a decade earlier however in 1987 the share of farm receipts attributable to exports is expected to be only 19 5 percent it is worth noting in this regard that the increase in direct federal farm program payments in 1987 when compared to 1981 represents an amount equal to 80 percent of the decline in the value of farm exports during the same period american agriculture during the past few years has made many painful adjustments in order to position itself to take advantage of improved trade opportunities however to realize the full benefits of a brighter export picture unitedstates producers must be able to depend on fair and open markets throughout the world the purpose of title vi is to ensure this necessary access on behalf of unitedstates farmers title vi increases the effectiveness of the unitedstates department of agriculture in agricultural trade policy formulation and implementation by providing clearer guidelines on what unitedstates agricultural policy should be the operations of the department are strengthened through authorizations for additional appropriations and additional personnel for the departments foreign agricultural service offices would be established within the agency to monitor trade practices and policies of other countries and provide assistance to unitedstates citizens and organizations damaged by unfair trade practices and policies longterm strategy reports to establish unitedstates agricultural trade policy goals would be required on an annual basis these provisions follow the recommendations of the national commission on agricultural trade and export policy created by congresspublic law 98412in 1984 the commission last year completed an 18month evaluation of unitedstates agricultural export trade these improvements should allow the department of agriculture to fully implement the trade provisions of this act and the food security act of 1985 the food security act of 1985 provided for 12 new or expanded export assistance programs since its inception the export enhancement program according to the unitedstates department of agriculture has resulted in approximately 33 percent more sales than would have been made in the absence of the program according to usda officials all of the 1 5 billion authorized for the program through fiscal year 1988 will be used thus title vi provides additional authorization of funding up to 2 5 billion through fiscal year 1990when the current farm bill expires this level of funding should ensure sufficient resources at approximately 500 million per year which equates to that currently being used by the department additionally the secretary of agriculture is authorized to prioritize traditional customers under the export enhancement program who purchase in quantities equal to their historical levels since current law requires priority to customers who purchase at levels greater than their usual requested levels this new provision will maximize use of the program in attracting additional foreign purchases to avoid unnecessarily inflating the costs of commodities used in the export enhancement program title vi contains a provision requiring that the value of commodities used in the program be determined by using the market value at the time of distribution in lieu of the acquisition cost to the commodity credit corporation other export program provisions provide extended authority to banks for cooperatives to finance the international transactions of agricultural cooperatives and standby authority for subsidized export sales of government stocks of basic agricultural commodities in an effort to ascertain which usda export assistance programs are most suited for lowincome and middleincome developing countries agricultural aid and trade missions would be established with the requirement that 15 missions be completed within 1 year of the enactment of the bill to further agricultural and economic development increased amounts of section 416 surplus commodities would be provided to developing countries and additional levels of monetization under title ii of public law 480 and section 416 programs is recommended to facilitate the work of nonprofit voluntary food donation agencies wood and wood products would be made eligible for concessional sales agreements under title i of public law 480 and for shortterm and intermediateterm export credit guarantees under the usdas gsm102 and gsm103 programs with regard to other international and domestic agricultural programs title vi contains provisions that would limit federal milk marketing

industry require a report on the sampling of imported meat poultry and egg products to ensure they meet federal inspection standards and require that tobacco farmer contributions to the tobacco price support program be taken into account in any section 22 investigation title vi is a bipartisan trade package that will enhance agricultural exports and provide needed benefits to our ailing

unassailable once again analogies to senator mccarthy come to mind it would seem that the gentleman from georgia has become the selfappointed arbiter of the content of debate in the house in the last 2 years alone he has risen more than a dozen times to deliver impassioned speeches lamenting the alleged sins of his colleagues ie has singled out at least 17 members by naine for condemnation while he has thus busied himself sitting in stern judgment on so many of his fellow members he has displayed a poverty of interest in legislation which is presumably what he entered congress to enact i did a little research and it says in the congressional quarterlys recent volume politics in america the 100th congress the authors concluded that after four terms it is hard to think of one significant piece of legislation he mr gingrich has helped enact in examining the slender list of legislative issues in which the gentlemen hs chosen to interest himself one would wonder how many people in georgia or anywhere else feel that the following issues have anything to do with the serious problems confronting our nation in the 1980s for example lie has supported tax incentives for families buying computers and the gentlemen has the distinction of having drafted a plan for the government of americans in space and the eventual statehood of space communities in this case this is an idea that literally came out of outer space i would not presume to decide for the gentlemans constituents what issues they ought to be most interested in but i would hazard a guess that the average georgian like the average arkansan does not lie awake nights worrying about the problems attending eventual statehood in outer space but they do worry about economic development the budget deficits unitedstates competitiveness in world markets agriculture peace health care social security and the myriad other issues that people deal with in their everyday lives when mr giricacu has come closer to home he has questioned a revered program that has been viewed as a success ever since the administration of president franklin delano roosevelt founded it half a century ago social security he proposed abolishing social security and replacing it with a mandatory system of individual retirement accounts such a policy would break the covenant we have made with the senior citizens of america who built this country it would renege on a fundamental commitment this government has made to provide a safety net for its older citizens it is appropriate to disagree sharply with the substance of a members position on this issue just as it is mr gin mens right to proposed such a scheme bizarre as it may seem to many bf us who have supported social security throughout our careers and who have commended the program as a shining example of government being the solution to critical economic and social problems of senior citi ens nonetheless that is substance and it is proper for the gentleman from georgia to challenge that program unfortunately the gentleman from georgia has not found his legislative initiatives to create a government for americans in space or his initiative replacing social security with iras to be so popular in this house that we would even debate it if he had i would have been delighted to debate him on those issues instead i think it is important to note that he has spent much more time declaring is colleagues guilty of ominous ethical failings by his standards the gentleman has certainly succeeded n one respect he has attracted enormous publicity few members have their names in the newspaper more often as he once said think of me as a backhencher who used to work very hard trying to figure out how can i articulate something in a flashy enough way so the press can pick it up now all of a sudden i have this microphone and when i yell it comes across like a painful noise because the system is not geared to carry me but if the gentleman from georgia has succeeded in the realm of publicity even members of his own party have doubts about his impact in the realm of substance as our distinguished colleague senator robert dole has said his agenda is in getting attention so he has to go after large targets hes making a lot of noise but i havent seen any impact this is somewhat reminiscent of the story that i once heard about the legii

sockless publicityseekingwhatever it was was harmless a recent example of mr gingrichs attacks upon his colleagues occurred in september of this year when he issued a news release naming 17 mcmbers who should be investigated by that whitewash machine the ethics committee it is curious that the ethics committee is a joke in his words and a whitewash machine when the gentleman from georg a disagrees with its actions while it becomes a powerful watchdeg over house rules when he agrees with its actions or when he wishes it to accept one of his proposals for an investigation the september 2 release pontificated that the entrenched nature of house membership and the monopoly of power which democrats have had in the house since 1954 make it obvious why there are so many cases of house democratic corruption just like the corrupt big city machines we now have a corrupt house machine and it is the nature of machines to abuse power this release is so clearly partisan in nature in condemning the alleged democratic corruption that it more properly should have been issued as a campaign release rather than as an official release putting the official imprimatur of the house office

the full committee by a vote of 25 to 24 reversing the vote of the subcommittee on financial institutions which had adopted a provision providing for a 15 billion 5year recapitalization by a vote of

revitalize and work themselves back into a healthy financial status the federal home loan bank board is in need of some direction from the congress as to how to manage this financial crisis and the

centuries of foreign rule freedom for the greeks was regained by the treaty of adrianople of 1829 and laterby the london protocol of 1830 in recognition of the contributions the people of greece have

believe it i have never had an accident in my life and i get picked up and he tells me this is two times i have been picked up in the same location and i am going to lose my license and they are going to take my insurance away i cannot believe it i have never had an accident in my life i did not see him for about 3 months and i said where have you been he said i have been in the hospital i said what happened to you and he said that i lost my license and right after that i am driving my car and i have an accident i do not have any insurance and i end up in the hospital it is obvious what the moral of the story is he happened to be picked up when he was driving too fast and this one time when he did not expect it he looks up to answer the telephone his wife called him to find out how he was doing because he had not been well that morning he answers the telephone and has an accident and goes into the hospital if he had been driving a little bit slower maybe he would not have had that accident now i am driving along many times and i see people passing me these is no question about it it is frustrating but i can remember when we passed the 55mileanhour speed limit at the national level why we did it we did it to conserve energy there is no question about it if you look at the facts it conserves energy now you can say well let the person go out and pay for more if he wants to drive faster he gets less miles per gallon that is not the point we are right back where we started when it comes to the amount of energy we import today the facts themselves say there are less accidents when you drive slower the facts say that there is more conservation when you drive slower one of the things about states rights is very interesting it is interesting to me that some of the people are saying states ought to have the right i remember the vote on letting the governors decide on whether the national guard should train down in central america some of those same people that are saying give the governors the right to decide what the situation is they said no no the federal government has to decide and let those national guard people train anyplace they want to so if you look at the facts and the facts are that if you drive 55 you have less of a chance of having an accident if you are injured you will sustain less of an injury it will be less expensive to the taxpayer and will conserve energy i urge the members to support jim howard and bud shuster who have done such an outstanding job i know since we already voted for the bill that nobody will then turn around and

offered by my republican colleague from the state of washington i commend him for his timely effort to focus attention on the need for a transition to democracy in chile and in particular for focusing on the role of press freedom in affecting such a transition for several years the congress has rightly focused attention to chiles deplorable human rights situation we are entering a new phase however when the congress will and appropriately should focus public attention to the lack of progress toward democracy in that country human rights violations still continue in chile we must not forget however that they are part of a larger pattern of repression and are but symptoms of a deeper problemnamely the lack of just representation during the next year chile is scheduled according to its 1980 constitution to conduct a plebiscite where a juntaappointed candidate for president who is to be nominated by the heads of the three military services and the national police will be subject to a yes or no vote by the electorate free contested pluralistic elections are essential prerequisites to the existence of a democracy the upcoming plebiscite does not constitute such a free and genuine election because voters are not given a choice among more than one candidate and they have no role in selecting the candidate in several respects therefore chiles constitutional mechanism for public representation created by the pinochet regime is similar hl11016 to that found in other nondemocratic countries where pro forma rituals are used to establish the appearances of just representation but lack the substance thereof the plebiscite provided for falls far short of the free and genuine elections necessary to provide just representation nonetheless for some chileans the plebiscite represents an opportunity to mobilize the population in establishing a democratic momentum and thus may represent a first step albeit imperfect toward an eventual return to democracy in august of 1987 international human rights law group a highly respected organization of lawyers dedicated to promoting respect for human rights sent a factfinding mission to chile as part of its election observer project the purpose of their mission was to observe and examine the conditions affecting the fairness of the upcoming electoral exercise i commend their entire report to the attention of my colleagues and have taken the liberty of citing a few of their observations in support of mr millers timely amendment the pinochet regime has made some progress in the last few months in opening up political space to permit a partial restoration in some of the freedoms normally associated with democratic nations the delegation found that at presentthere is a very active opposition press that publishes articles critical of the government and covers the opposition political parties however a number of newspaper and magazine publishers and reporters have been indicted before the military courts for allegedly defaming the armed forces in their publications and many have been imprisoned even more frequently the government has harassed journalists by detaining them without subsequently bringing charges in september 1986 the managing editor of one opposition magazine was murdered television the most important mass communications medium in chilean society is completely controlled by the government television viewers therefore receive a very onesided view of the political process there are no present plans to allow political parties access to free television time during the campaign process moreover freedom of political assembly in chile is still seriously curtailed theoretically under chilean law political parties in the process offormation have the right to solicit members but the delegation was informed that such parties have been prevented from doing so in public and that permits to hold outdoor rallies have not been granted groups such as the committees for free elections have not been granted permission to meet outdoors and have not been allowed to put up posters announcing legally permitted events in august of this year with the cosponsorship of the house

to engage in a colloquy a little later but first of all i think a little history lesson might be good i would like to read the act and the declaration of policy it seemed to be reversed every time i heard it mentioned here today and i would like to correct that for the record section 2 it is hereby declared to be policy of congress as a measure of national security to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the nations children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other foods again you have heard the order in which this was presented this is the way it has always been so i want to correct the record because i have heard it repeated several times now today in reverse order for years 17 before i came here as an administrator and 13 since i have been here i had seen the problems of commodity distribution and we have heard over and over again from the people who are doing the school lunch program and the child nutrition program back in the districts of august 1987 all of the problems and they recite them year after year after year however they will say then at the end dont change anything because if you have money out there instead of commodities the congress may take that money away from us and they cant take the commodities away that is not the way it happened in 1981 folks they discovered that that was not true at all as a matter of fact they lost commodity money was that not a shock to them all i want to point out is if the american public ever knew the amount of money involved in trying to make these distributions they would rise in outrageouswhateverbecause in many instances you buy and then you store and then you shift to the state and they store and then you shift to the local school district now they cannot take care of 50 pounds of frozen hamburger so they have to send it out someplace to store it then when they want to use it they also have to send it out and have it reprocessed so they can use it so for years and years and years we have been trying to find a way to improve food distribution as someone said in our hearings it does not matter which administration it does not get any better it is getting better now why is it getting better because for the first time in the history the department now has a little competition because you authorized some program where you said you could either take cash or you could have a commodity letter of credit let me talk about commodity letter of credit what could be any better if you want to move surplus commodities or commodities that you think are going to be a glut on the market than a commodity letter of credit why is it so great first it is controlled by the secretary of agriculture they cannot take it and go buy what they want to buy they can only buy what he says they can buy that is one so he takes care of any surpluses or anything he perceives that is going to be a glut on the market second they can buy locally and take that surplus away before it ever becomes a storage item and it does not have to be reprocessed in most instances so you get the best of all worlds there now cash cash is something that has been going on a long time is it not amazing we have one state in this union that does this totally different than any other state the state of kansas many years ago decided that we are not going to have any distribution program anymore we are going to get rid of that whole mess as a matter of fact we are going to get out of it so what happens well as the good senator said well i think the government then ought to give us cash in lieu of those commodities that we dont want to bother with and somebody over here in the house must have traded something off i do not know and said we will help you get it so the state of kansas gets their bonus commodities and then they get cash for everything elseonly one state but the commodity letter of crediti do not see how you can do a better job of taking care of surplus than having a commodity letter of credit let me say that the bill as it originally came in my estimation did not do anything more than the secretary can presently do however he seemed to think he needed additional authority so i have no problems with that even though as i said i do not think it does anything any different the original bill than what he now has the power to do but i am happy to support the compromise that we have i think it will take care of both the need to improve nutrition on the one hand and on the other hand to take care of the excess commodities that we have you have to understand the program everybody gets the surplus commodities no matter what program you are under you all get the bonus commodities we are really not talking about those we are talking about those that the secretary goes out and purchases and then tries to distribute through a horrible distribution program and sometimes i think the school food services is linked up somehow or other with the distribution peoplethey get in bed together as i sometimes think lobbyists are lobbying from all different angles and representing and probably getting much more money than any of us in the congress of the united states get because i guess they have more accounts let me say that i rise in support of what we have come up with as a compromise i rise in support of h r 1340 the commodities distribution reform act of 1987 this bill which has been under the supervising eye of two committees of jurisdiction contains a good compromise which balances the agricultural removal programs with those of providing a nutritious meal to schoolchildren the elderly and the needy i applaud the committee members and their work in arriving at a bipartisan compromise this substitute contains not only improvements to the commodity distribution system but contains an extension of the current existing cash and cloc programs for years we have heard the continuous complaints and chronic problems about the distribution system involved in getting foods to the local recipient our intent in this substitute is to grant the department of agriculture the statutory authority which they believe they do not have and yet need to improve the program we therefore are not only giving them this authority but are giving them a mandate to use that authority in a timely manner we are serious about these changes we have relaxed the time lines in order to allow for meaningful comment to regulations which we expect the department to implement maximum public comment will ensure the best promulgated regulations there exists a vital link between the state and federal agencies we expect states as we expect the department to make reforms each state should make complementary reforms so that we can proceed knowing all has been done to make a complicated program work better an important aspect of this bill is the pilot project extension even though we commend the department for recent changes to improve the program i believe the pilots should be given credit for the serious reform of the commodity distribution program taken recently by the department the competition of alternatives is forcing the department to perform better these programs are not designed to dismantle the commodity removal programs but are alternatives to the current distribution method of those commodities available the bottom line is still removal no matter the method then using the surplus to feed people since the current commodity distribution program applies to everyone except the 64 pilots and the state of kansas it has the greatest impact on the most number of youngsters therefore we intend the commodity program to work and work well however if the interested groups including the department do not greatly improve the program with these legislative changes i am reserving the right to revisit offering the cloc option to all local agencies again i rise in support of this bill and urge my colleagues to join me in support of its passage i would like to engage in a little colloquy very quickly if we could have it with the gentleman from california"], [0.6038225293159485,

verde rivers north of phoenix in 1976 in the face of intense opposition by an indian tribe environmentalists and the carter administration orme was shelved and a long process begun to identify a suitable alternative authorized by the 1968 act cliff dam became an object of controversy for many reasons in particular because of its potential adverse impacts on sonoran desert nesting bald eagles and their habitat increasing opposition from the coalition in the courts and in congress influenced the delegations decision to seek a settlement that would eliminate the persistent and serious threat which the coalition poses to the continued funding needed to complete the central arizona project as scheduled the essence of the cliff dam settlement agreement is that in return for the delegations commitment not to seek funding for cliff the coalition will drop its lawsuit against the dam and the other features plan 6 as well as their efforts in congress to limit funding for the central arizona

arizona project it also creates some new problems the delegation is emphatically committed to working with the appropriate federal agencies and arizona entities to resolve these problems three stand

realized they must come to the peace table i again encourage my colleagues to read this mornings washington post editorial urging members to approve the aid package noting thatthe record of the last 6 months demonstrates we believe that a carrotandstick combination has moved the sandinistas with ceasefire talks scheduled to resume next week this is no time to demobilize the forces of one side alone indeed unless the contras are supported we have no other viable alternative as an effective pressure on the sandinista regime many of those opposing this military aid which will be placed in escrow until march 31 seem to lack the confidence that the sandinistas will comply with a ceasefire todays vote comes 6 months after the guatemala meeting of the central american countriesafter two extensions on the date for implementation why should we trust the words of the sandinistas now the promises made to the oas in 1979 have so often and repeatedly been violated that we would sound like broken records if we focus on that nonetheless lets look at the more recent promises made at the guatemala meeting in august 1987 we have received fresh firsthand intelligence information from recent nicaraguan defector maj roger miranda regarding the real intentions of the sandinistas as major miranda stated in a meeting with house members at the same time as they were talking about peace under the esquipulas ii agreement in nicaragua training of salvadoran guerrillas training of guatemalan guerrillas went on as early as 1980 the sandinistas had created an agency simply called the bureau which coordinates logistics for the various guerrilla movements in central america major miranda confirmed that as late october 1987 when he defected the guerrilla groups with headquarters in managua were still being granted facilities and military training by the sandinistas in addition major miranda has confirmed and provided critical data to substantiate our fear that the sandinistas have every intention of establishing a strong prosoviet military presence in central america as miranda verified the worst part is that in the second week of october the sandinista directorate approved a plan which had been drawn up in september with the soviets and cubans in managua regarding the development of the sandinista army over the next 8 years the sandinistas have planned near exponential military buildups in nicaragua including a 600 000 man fighting force bristling with soviet armaments even at this time the sanfebruaou 3 1988 februa 3 1988 dinista military at 75 000 strong is the largest armed force in central america what are mr ortegas motives in his most recent promises mr ortega opened the january 1517 regional peace plan review meeting with the five central american presidents with a request for an additional extension on the deadline for compliance when his request was denied by the four democratic leaders and the peace plan seemed doomed mr ortega announced his own concessions the most current sandinista promises include an end to the 6 year state of emergency direct talks with the armed resistance and amnesty for more political prisoners we mustnt overlook the process which was set in motion on august 7 1987almost 6 months ago to the day the date set for implementation of the tenets of the accords was november 790 days after the signing in september 16 nonnicaraguan prisoners were pardoned 985 political prisonersout of the 8 000 to 10 000 estimated by the independent nicaraguan permanent commission on human rightswere finally released on november 22 among the midjanuary list of concessions made by mr ortega his new promise for amnesty is conditional to a ceasefire or should the united states or any noncentral american country accept the prisoners any conditions placed on the general amnesty is in contradiction to the peace accords not until the sandinista regime was backed up against a wall did mr ortega agree to meet with the contras in limited direct talksthe meeting has been set for next week when the sandinistas agreed to president arias suggestion that cardinal obando y bravoa very respectable religious leader gentleman whom i have had the honor to meetbe appointed as mediator in the negotiations a glimmer of hope for a ceasefire was set aflame repeatedly the sandinistas refused direct talks with the resistance and insisted that the contras lay down their arms prior to any talks the concessions ignore several tenets of the peace accords and are not enough to ensure the sandinista commitment to genuine changethe steps toward democratization must be irreversible steps although the peace accords committed the central american countries to an authentic democratic process pluralistic and participatory only 1 week after the signing the peaceful derronstrations of the nicaraguan democratic coordinator and the january 22 movement of mothers of political prisoners were abruptly put down the state security used electric cattle prods sticks and dogs to disperse the crowds and a number of individuals were arrested including two wellknown opposition leaders again as recently as january 22 of this year the offices of the internal opposition coalition the nicaraguan democratic coordinator and a peaceful demonstration of the january 22 mothers of political prisoners movement were attacked by sandinista mobs and yet the police did not attempt to halt the attacks at this time the state of emergency has been lifted but arrests and attacks of opposition leaders and groups have continued the sandinistas have permitted one opposition newspaper the la presa to be published and one radio station radio catolica to be broadcast this is a step in the right direction and yet all newspapers should be permitted to operate freely radio catolica was initially prohibited from broadcasting news and in fact about 20 radio stations have still not been granted permission to broadcast news as interior minister tomas borge directed the news directors every news medium respect the desire of the revolution in other words the sandinistas activities must not be criticized the national reconciliation committee which was called for in the peace accords has been ineffective while the committee was designed to verify the fulfillment of the commitments undertaken by the central american governments and to initiate dialog with all domestic political opposition groups the sandinistas have refused to discuss with internal opposilion groups lasting constitutional reform and new elections how should we be expected to believe that true democratizationwith free and open electionswill be granted when mr ortega makes statements such as if the sandinista front lost an election the sandinista front would hand over government not power the aid to the contras must be supported if we fail to approve this aid based on ortegas most recent promises and concessions we fail to provide a safety net for ourselves and more importantly for those forces truly committed to democracy lets give mr ortega one more chanceuntil march 31to comply but lets have this mechanism in place should the sandinistas fail to live up

of the reagan administration helper regulation illegal the district court has refused to implement a new helper regulation until it is a rewritten rule to conform with the court of ap peals decision the stonholm amendment seeks to codify the same reagan helper proposal that ha3 given the courts and the department of labor significant problems both the department labor and congres sional proponents of a new helper regulation have claimed that it will enhance minority employmont but academic experts in the field of construction such as dr john dunlop former secretary of labor under president ford have concluded that the helper provision would adversely affect minority employment dr dunlop has pointed out that such a provision will allow contractors to require construction laborers to perform the same work at lower wages under the guise of the helper classification this would severely limit the employment standards ard opportunities of the segment of the construction work force which is largely composed of minority members the department of labors own regulatory impact analysis of its helper proposal states this outcome in no uncertain terms when it concluded that under the proposed regulation helpers could in some instances replace laborers as well as journeymen many laborers particularly those in the nonunion sector struggle to earn a living wage at semiskilled work these workers like manv others on the lower end of the economic ladder always faced efforts to have themselves reclassified into lower paying jobs this is precisely what the helper

strategic issue i find it distasteful that we play politics with the defense of our country the soviets now have a sufficient number of modern accurate weapons they can use to destroy most of our

dramatic move during a future crisis the advantage of midg3tman and rail gardson based mx is that they will be able to move during a cdsls and possibly avoid destruction in a soviet first strike so

with us this evening but the hour has run on later than most of us anticipated so i will submit their statements for the record and simply conclude by saying that i followed in the footsteps of a colleague who first alerted me to the role of general mihailovic and ironically he was not a serb it was our former distinguished colleague the honorable ed derwinski who had fought long and hard against state department objections a body in which he now serves as an under secretaryand a distinguished onebut he fought for years to get the state department to release the suppressed information about the fact that general mihailovic was the recipient of our legion of honor and that it had been done at the recommendation of general eisenhower for his outstanding role in world war ii it had in fact been presented by president harry truman for whatever perverse reason our state department endeavored to keep that information quiet it is a sad commentary on our own state department it seems to me because there was abundant evidence of the role that general mihailovic played even when he had in fact been betrayed by our allied forces because of the communist disinformation that had been fed though british intelligence we stopped our support he did not stop his ongoing war against the nazi invaders but he was being attacked on two fronts simultaneously not only was he fighting the nazis and in the process contributed mightily to the failure of hitler in world war ii because that is what cost hitler his soviet campaign but simultaneously he was dealing with an element within his own country of communists who had put him on their hit list as surely as the nazis had him on theirs the subsequent postworld war ii information revealed the collusion the active working cooperation between the communists in yugoslavia and the nazis right down to the very end of the war notwithstanding the fact that the soviets after hitler doublecrossed stalin the soviets had joined the allied cause theoretically and yet there was still a cozy working relationship that existed between those two elements in yugoslavia to his credit and to the honor of the man general mihailovic continued he did his rescue work of the majority of those american airmen who had been downed at the time we turned our back on him it was georgia musulin who as my colleague from maryland indicated sadly passed away last month and i say especially sadly because he was in the vanguard of trying to get recognition on behalf of the downed american airmen many of whom are still surviving who fought for years to get a monument erected in this town to honor general mihailovic for what he did in their behalf but george never lived long enough to see that monument i would share the views expressed by my colleague from maryland that this 100th congress in the centennial of the congress of the united states when we are celebrating the bicentennial of our constitution and we are honoring those immortal lines in the preamble that those men wanted to secure unto themselves and to their posterity the blessings of liberty that this is a fitting time a fitting moment to honor general mihailovic first to honor the patriots like george musulin who went in there on the oss operations headed up that very daring rescue operation to bring american transport aircraft in with nazi camps within just a handful of miles on either side dramatically land those plans in cow pastures after the cows had been chased off quickly load the american airmen aboard and get them out and if you talk to many of those airmen one of the things that comes across so forcefully is their gratitude not only to general mihailovic who saved their lives but to the serbian people in those homes they were sheltered during the time they were hiding from the nazis these were poor mountain folks who did not have a great deal of resources available at their disposal but what they did have they insisted that the airmen partake of before they would share it with their own families they moved those airmen around from house to house kept them alive and as i say over 500 were ultimately rescued because of that loyalty and the devotion of the serbian people not just to the united states but to really high ideals the highest ideals that this country has acknowledged as have those serbian patriots who participated in that operation so as i say we are honoring the birthday of a great man the 94th anniversary of his birth a man who may have felt that the whole world turned on him when he was put to death by the dictator

have held extensive hearings on commodity distribution programs and have consistently urged the usda to improve its distribution methods the secretary of agriculture demonstrated his fur ther commitment in december 1985 by establishing a task force to report to him on means to improve usdads commodity purchase and distribution activities in june 1987 the task force issued its report which is comprehensive and lists specific improvements to be made in recognition of this the amejican school food service association which is a nonprofit association of 60 000 members comprised of employees that administer and staff the child nutrition programs at the state and local level adopted a resolution on july 24 1987 the associations resolution found that usda hasresponded to their

commitment to improvements in the commodity distribution program m r 1340 was agreed to by the committee on agriculture to whom the bill was referred on june 3 1987 that bill was a carefully thoughtout and constructive measure that required the secretary of agriculture to take certain steps to improve the distribution of agricultural commodities and food products acquired by the usda that are donated that bill had a wide range of support from organizations involved in the commodity distribution program such as the american school food service associations and agricultural organizations representing nmilk producers fruit and vegetable organizations and farm organizations h r 1340 was later sequentially referred to the committee on education and labor who reported a substitutebill

this bill does not in any way restrict the secretary of agricultures ability to acquire commodities and that it is our intention to ensure that nutritious commodities are distributed we agree that the secretary must be able to respond quickly to accomplish surplus removal activities in a highly volatile market we have always agreed on the need to constantly improve the administration of the commodity distribution program it is important that price support and surplus removal programs which are vital to farmers not be restricted the goals of the commodity distribution program are consistent with this we must ensure that good quality food s provided to schools and other agencies thatl americas agricultural markets are strengthened and that the commodity distribution program operates in an orderly fashion we do not need a complex ineffi cient system providing fewer agricultural commodities nor do we need a system that provides highly processed food and reduces the amount of food acquired from farmers the issues raised concerned the secretary of agricultures ability to manage price support surplus removal and direct purchase programs by requiring that the secretary develop specifications for commodities acquired through price support surplus removal and direct purchase programs of the department of agriculture we do not intend that the department be constrained in its commodity surplus removal activities our intention is to ensure that the nutritious agriculture commodities distributed to recipient agencies be of a quality and type that can be packaged in sizes or processed into forms useful to these recipient agencies in addition we recognize that in the case of surplus removal operations involving highly perishable goods in a volatile market the requirement that recipient agencies get 60days notice of the types and quantities to be distributed may not be administratively feasible in all situations in such instances the dual objectives of the commodity distribution programsurplus removal and distribution of nutritious agriculture commodities to recipient agencies wiil be best achieved with a shorter notification period we however expect that the secretary to the maximum extent feasible will comply with the 60day notification requirement and stress that it will fully expect that instances of emergency will be the exception rather than

such time as i may consume i want to express my strong support for the insider trading and securities fraud enforcement act of 1988 in recent years wall street has been plagued by a series of insider trading scandals that has undermined the publics confidence in the integrity of our markets the sec and the department of justice have acted with great diligence and resolve to track down these lawbreakers while federal law enforcement officials the selfregulatory organizations and the securities industry have worked hard to stop insider trading i believe that the time has come for new legislation this bill augments current enforcement efforts in several mean ingful ways i want to outline some of the bills important provisions the bill requires brokerdealers and investment advisers to establish maintain and enforce a surveillance sytem designed to prevent insider trading if the surveillance system fails and that failure substantially contributed to or substantially permitted insider trading by a controlled person or if the firm knew of or recklessly disregarded an imminent violation and failed to takes appropriate steps to prevent it the brokerdealer or investment adviser may be subject to a substantial civil penalty these requirements will place the surveillance burden of detecting insider trading squarely but fairly on the shoulders of brokerage firms and advisers in addition under appropriate circumstances the bill also would subject controlling persons to a civil penalty when the controlled persons violation involves tipping however in these situations the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided to be used in calculating the civil penalty shall be limited to the profit or loss of the tippee to whom the controlled person directed lhls or her coimnunication this limitation is intended to make controlling persons subject to a penalty with respect to direct tippees but not for an endless chain of remote tippees the provision also recognizes that an illegal tip can be made through a conduit as well as directly a similar restriction is added in the private rights section of the bill these limitations will ensure that the civil penalty does not become disproportionate to the violation furthermore this bill is not intended to alter the underlying standards for establishing tipper or tippee liability set forth in the dirks case while the legislation increases the sanctions for insider trading by not altering the underlying standards for determining what constitutes insider trading it is my belief that this legislation will not curtail the flow of information to the securities markets the bill also includes a provision allowing the sec to pay bounties to persons who provide information about insider trading under certain circumstances this provision will make insider trading exceedingly difficult to hide and should bring more cases to the secs door step the provision grants the sec broad discretion as to when to pay bounties to informants it is my view that the commission should not pay bounties to compliance officials and other employees of brokerdealers and investment advisers except under extraordinary circumstances if the sec were to pay bounties routinely to these firms employees the bounties would create economic incentives that would undermine the surveillance system requirements of the bill the bill allows the sec to assist foreign securities authorities in investigating insider trading and other frauds the purpose of this provision is to encourage foreign authorities to cooperate with the sec when one of its investigations leads abroad this provision was recommended by the sec and is very similar to a provision that originally appeared in the republican securities bill h r 2668 finally i am very proud of the provision in the bill that directs the sec to undertake a new special study of the securities markets in 1961 congress enacted legislation requiring the commission to make a comprehensive study of the markets that study was completed in 1963 and became a landmark effort that set the stage for the 1964 amendments to the securities laws i have been a vigorous proponent of enacting legislation for a new study the study contemplated by this bill may examine insider trading and any other subject affecting the fairness orderliness breadth and depth of the securities markets as a consequence this study should be at least as far reaching as the 1963 study and can be more extensive if the commission deems it appropriate such an effort will give the congress a longterm plan for the future of our securities markets into the next century this legislation would not have become a reality without the tenacity and leadership of several members of the committee i commend chairman dingell and chairman markey for their leadership and cooperation and the ranking republican member of the full committee mr lwt for his statesmanship and skill in addition i want to

federal housing authority demolished the first highrise in the scudder home project public housing project of newark nj it was built in the 1960s at a cost of 20 million in the ensuing years the department of housing and urban development poured another additional 36 million into that project it is being destroyed right in front of the eyes of those poor and inner city residents who are in desperate need of housing next week the feds are going to do it again to another project recently the hud manager in newark nj said this all of us who had any part in funding approving designing managing or living in these buildings have been admonished by the conditions that now exist in them what a shame newark nj and all over this country public housing projects are being demolished because it has not worked in some cases it has but in all too many instances it has failed to deliver the hope and the opportunity that poeple want for housing the kemp amendment cosponsored by my friend from texas the gentleman from missouri and others would allow inner city lowincome residents of public housing projects an opportunity to buy their apartment buy that piece of property buy that home for 25 percent of the market rate i think each and every one of us have heard the statistics the gentlewoman from new jersey has been such a fighter on behalf of housing and i respect her very much she told me recently 70 000 apartments are vacant was there anything wrong with a radical solution let us sell it off let us sell off those apartments and that housing to those innercity residents who want a chance to purchase a piece of the american dream i do not stand up here and advocate selling off public housing but i think we ought to give lowincome people a chance to manage their own destiny not only with tenant management which i strongly support but this idea of allowing them to purchase that apartment or that home at 25 or lower percent of the market rate with a subsidized mortgage rate i recently got a letter from kimmie gray the chairwoman of the public housing resident tenant coalition of america one of the most dynamic inner city activists in the country she said she opposes h r 4 at least in the home ownership provisions because it places too many restrictions on the purchase and the resale of low income property she said and i quote public housing residents should not be treated as second class citizens any longer she said something i want to share with everybody she said we have the same dreams as every other american if this bill is about dreams about ownership about home ownership about public housing and getting an opportunity to have a piece of that dream it seems to me that we ought to take a more radical or a more progressive step deciding on what word you want to choose and allow those people those innercity residents to buy their apartment at 25 percent of the market rate congressman fauntroy and i cosponsored this in 1986 it passed by about 320 there is no argument against it we can replace the public housing stock by having the public housing authority determine what public housing has been sold what should be rehabilitated what vouchers should go to the family who wants to buy another one or rent another one or what the feds should do with regard to rebuilding the stock that might be removed from the authority i think it is a piece of americas dream that we ought to offer to the innercity poor and i would suggest that democrats and republicans ought to have no problem supporting such a radical or progressive idea furthermore while there is near universal approval of lowincome home ownership goals some legitimate questions have been raised about our amendment and we would like to address those concerns below question would this reduce the housing stock for the poor no renters will simply be turned into homeowners the same number of lowincome residents will be served as now we also deal with the replacement issue by first requiring local public housing authorities to implement a plan to replaceby the provision of housing vouchers rehabilitation of vacant public housing units or construction of new public housingthe public housing units sold or such percentage of the units sold as the public housing agency determines is justified by the local supply of lower income housing second requiring that funds raised from selling housing be used by local phas for new construction and rehabilitation only this could amount to billions of new funds for construction and rehabilitation third requiring the federal government to issue one new housing voucher for each unit sold fourth giving the resident management corporation or public housing agency involved the right to purchase the dwelling unit at the price for which the family has received a firm offer fifth requiring hud to make an annual report recommending new funds to ensure decent homes and decent neighborhoods including the need for additional budget authority to build new housing sixth offering 70 000 vacant units to be rehabilitated and sold under the conditions of our amendment question would this amendment skim the best units from public housing authorities not if kenilworthparkside and other resident managed projects are any precedent these projects once among the poorest have become good candidates for home ownership the dream of resident management and ultimate home ownership powerfully encourages even poorer housing projects to improve operations maintenance and efficiency question what is the overall cost of the amendment the amendment will not add to spending or violate the budget act government receipts would actually be increased as housing is sold question arent most public housing projects high rise ghettos that no one would want to buy some housing projects are dismal places indeedwhich underscores the importance of promoting home ownership to improve living conditions and upgrade neighborhoods contrary to public opinion however most public housing projects are quite livable and in good to excellent condition according to a hud survey in 1982 43 percent of the housing stock was in good to excellent condition 29 percent was in fair condition and less than 28 percent was in poor condition question arent most projects high rise buildings that would be difficult to convert no according to hud only about 27 percent of the projects are high rise buildings 32 percent are garden apartments 16 percent are lowrise walk up apartments and 25 percent of the projects containing 10 percent of the units are single family detached or townhouse units even high rise units if organized carefully can be converted in part or in whole to cooperative or condomium home ownership question isnt this an untried scheme to the contrary great britains government sold over 800 000 of its public housing stock under a program resembling but far less generous than ours while there are significant differences in the two situationsfor one britains public housing tenants have higher incomes on average than american residentsthe british example demonstrtes the potential for lowincome home ownership opportunities question suppose some residents do not want to buy tenants who dont want to buy are entirely protected no one may be evicted as a result of this amendment residents may choose to remain in their home and continue to rent from the public housing authority or be given a housing voucher and relocate if that is their wish question home ownership efforts have failed in the past why will your initiative be any different our most important guarantee of success is that we build on resident management groupspeople and projects who have already demonstrated expertise responsibility financial skills and good organization ability unlike past efforts we give tenants full home ownership rights after 5 years lowinterest financing training and technical assistance and an immediate 75 percent equity stake in their property to discourage default or abandonment of property hud must also certify that the residents can afford home ownership question wont there be a quick turnover of public housing to the nonpoor no quick resales of property are discouraged because hud recaptures a portion of any windfall gain for a 5year period neighborhood demographics can be expected to change slowly i ask the skeptics one question how can anyone concerned with the poor minorities and cities ignore this opportunity to increase the wealth of some of our poorest citizens by 14 billion shouldnt we be doing all we can to assure all americans a decent home and a decent neighborhood i ask your support of this pathbreaking amendment that could open up vast new housing opportunities to lowincome people and improve some of americas most troubled neighborhoods"]]}
