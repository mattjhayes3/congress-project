opposition to the rule and really in a state of wonderment wonderment about how on earth this congress of the united states can be so insensitive to a challenge to the american people it is our responsibility to honor our preamble to the constitution to promote the general welfare that is in the preamble of our constitution which we take an oath to defend the distinguished gentleman from oklahoma whom i respect said just be patient no no ninetyfour days since the president of the united states asked for the amount of resources necessary to address the zika crisis an amount of money that was requested by the scientists documented by the urgency of this challenge for the research and for the prevention and for the resources needed to address this public health emergency i rise not only as the house democratic leader i rise as a mother and a grandmother and i speak to parents and grandparents in this body because that is all i am allowed to speak to the questions that i have for you are how can we ignore the presidents scientifically based request expressed in the words of dr fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the national institutes of health a person a healthcare leader in our country a researcher a scientist who has been described by president george herbert walker bush as a heroas a heroin his work for the american people and their public health dr fauci says if we dont get the money that the president has asked for the 1 9 billion that is going to have a very serious negative impact on our ability to get the job done another scientist dr tom frieden director of the centers for disease control the public health agency to stop this threat said never before in history has there been a situation where a bite from a mosquito can result in devastating fetal malformation testimony went on to say that we are talking about children with irreversible brain damage who will never be able to walk talk see or hear children whose care over a lifetime is estimated to cost more than 10 million the money is one thing the devastation to that child and to that family is far more consequential so the 1 9 billion is a great deal of money it is an emergency it is a small price to pay to prevent irreversible brain damage in our children it is a small price to pay instead of saying to families dont think about having children now because of this epidemic the republicans are treating the threat of zika with so little seriousness that they decided to use the crisis as an opportunity to eliminate protections for the water that our children drink the socalled zika vector control act the republicans are adding to this package this morning that they are asking you to vote for is nothing but a longstanding and craven repackaged republican effort to gut the clean water act it is a pesticide trojan horse that will do nothing to protect americans from zika this is really a dishonoring of our responsibility to protect and defend our fellow americans as our distinguished member of the committee on rules mentioned this is a defense issue it is about protecting the american people this proposal today puts forth onethird of what the president has asked foronethird people say arent you happy with onethird of a loaf it is not onethird of a loaf it is onethird of a shoe you cannot get there from here with onethird it is really an insult to the scientists who have spoken out actually it is onethird of the presidents request but it is onefifth of what the cdc has requested for the public health activities we must elevate the importance of the public health responsibility that we have if we had a natural disaster fema has funds to come to the rescue of the american people that is our compact with the american people to help them in ways that they could never help themselves because of the scope of the challenge this is no less a challenge in fact it would probably result in more loss of life malformation of unborn children on top of that think of the negative impact it will have distrust to travel to certain regions in our country this is so reckless just when i thought i had seen it all on the part of the republicans in the congress to disregard meeting the needs of the american people along comes this incomprehensible explanation to anybody why this might be a proposal worthy of the floor of the house worthy of the public health challenge to the american people worthy of our concerns about the american people my republican colleagues you have outdone yourselves today what you are doing is reckless in this bill we should be meeting this challenge the way we meet emergencies with adequate resources which will end up saving money because they will be an investment in the health of the american people it has been over 90 days since the president has made the request i will just say this one other thing it is not our role to instill fear but we have to face the challenge in a very cleareyed way the virus from this mosquito is sexually transmitted we have no ideait could be as long as 18 monthshow long it would reside in a gentleman who might be bitten by the mosquito it could be over a year it could be shorter but it is not one night secondly if you get bitten by this mosquito when you travel someplace where it might be pervasive you not only get bitten yourself you bring it home again it is sexually transmitted it is transmitted in even more pervasive ways any other garden variety mosquito that would bite you who have already been bitten by the other mosquito now is a carrier of that virus we turn garden variety mosquitoes into an army on the assault of the public health of the american people so again as a mother and a grandmother as a parent and for the fathers and grandfathers who serve here think of the children think of the risk think of the responsibility that we have think of the irresponsibility of this bill before us today

may consume i thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes i rise today in opposition to the rule providing for general debate on h r 4909 the ndaa or national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2017 for 54 straight years the united states congress has come together in a bipartisan fashion to craft policies and recommendations for the united states armed forces and to put these into law as has been indicated of course this is one of the most consequential and substantial items that we have it is one of our responsibilities here in the united states congress personally i have found objections to some of the policies in the bill of course i commend the work of the men and women on the armed services committee on this legislation i am going to highlight some of the problems that exist and why many of us on both sides of the aisle will likely be opposing the legislation many of my colleagues on the armed services committee currently serve or have served in the armed forces they are dedicated public servants and they have worked hard on this bill of course the bill includes the rest of us as well over 375 amendments have been offered to improve this bill the rules committee will be meeting this afternoon to determine how many of those we make in order and i hope that the rules committee makes in order a great number of these amendments of course the first step under this rule is to make a few dozen amendments in order and we will continue that work in the rules committee shortly for all the hard work that the armed services committee has done what we have before us this week is unfortunately an argument that needs to be resolved in the budget committee what we have is effectively an accounting trick that drives us deeper into debt and increases the budget deficit to pay for 1 year of increased defense spending to this point i object to having this budget debate even in the context of a defense bill but by disregarding the proper use of what is called the overseas contingency operations account and by flouting the budget control act agreed upon by republicans and democrats unfortunately this armed services bill has been overtaken by a debate on the federal budget what we have before us is a bill that will increase the deficit and increase the debt above and beyond the spending levels the democrats and republicans agreed to the freespending republican party continues to throw taxpayer dollar after taxpayer dollar do they just intend to drive up the debt or do they intend to increase your taxes when we increase our deficit it means increased taxes effectively this republican bill is a tax increase on future american families like my kids so this week we see a debate about the inability of the republicans to pass a budget or adhere to a budget when they do agree to one if the debate over our armed services was not such a serious topic i would say that this was a very clever elaborate budget scheme and it is clever it is far too clever more so than the traditional budget gimmicks that we have been presented with i am going to explain to you exactly what this taxandspend republican plan is the bill authorizes 540 billion in discretionary base budget authority that includes 523 billion for the dod and 19 5 billion for the department of energys defense work but since the united states has been embroiled in conflict abroad since 2001 several administrations have requested and congress has always granted another pot of money known as the overseas contingency fund this year the bill provides 59 billion for what we call overseas contingency now together with the 543 billion base plus the 59 million in overseas contingency that equals the presidents budget request now as a reminder the republicans havent actually produced a budget this year so it is hard to make a comparison all we can do is compare it to the presidents budget because there is no house budget and there is no republican budget we havent even seen one to be able to act on it or have a debate traditionally we bring before the body several budgets and whichever one gets the most votes is the budget of the house there are usually several budgets from the democratic side several budgets from the republican side in years past there have even been bipartisan budgets which i have been honored to support this year however republicans are not even allowing the house of representatives to consider no less pass a budget so what the ndaa does is it takes this overseas contingency account which many consider to be a slush fund for pentagon operations and it takes 18 billion of that to pay for base operations some of that 18 billion goes to fund the pentagons unfunded priorities or what we might call their wish list or items that they couldnt fit into the agreedupon budget control number of 543 billion so this busts through the deficit increases the debt it is a republican plan to tax and spend tax and spend tax and spend like they always do through accounting tricks that they are doing right here in the defense budget so the pentagon gets more of the bigticket items they want taxpayers are left paying the bill to the detriment of our economy to the detriment of job creation so that our own kids have to pay future taxes putting our nation deeper and deeper in debt which i should point out to my friends is a national security issue when we are economically beholden to other nations like china or saudi arabia that is as great if not greater a national security threat than the one we combat with the tanks and armed forces that this bill seeks to authorize so it is very important to take that into account if we look at what are the reasons that we defeated the soviet union during the cold war they overinvested in their defense relative to their gdp which effectively hurt their economy and made their economic model unsustainable because they were allocating too much to defense to try to keep up with where we were if we mortgage our future to the chinese and saudi arabians how are we increasing our security mr speaker in fact we are decreasing our security to fund current consumption for 1 year at the price of mortgaging our future to foreign adversaries by stealing 18 billion from the overseas contingency account the ndaa guarantees that we run out of money for overseas operations sometime in april 2017 and of course this congress would never let money run out for operations against isis and afghanistan and elsewhere so of course when it comes down to it this bill will come before congress in april and congress will make sure that we have the money we need to fight isis because they looted from this bill the money that was designed to fight isis to pay for items on the pentagons wish list so that is what is happening here rather than appropriating money to combat isis and afghanistan and other countries for the full year they are just doing it for a few months they are taking some of that money putting it into the base mortgaging our future putting burdens on taxpayers and making us economically at risk of being dominated by the countries that we continue to borrow from look that is why the secretary of defense and that is why the president of the united states the commander in chief are completely against this way of budgeting it is fiscally irresponsible as the ranking member of the armed services committee testified at the rules committee yesterday this old gimmick probably violates the bipartisan budget control act when you do that that is where the budget debate gets going congress has set limits on how much we can spend on defense versus nondefense so when we run out of money next year under this ndaa plan we are going to be forced to spend more i mean who before us is not going to spend the money we need to combat isis of course congress will spend more this is a plan to set up congress to spend more of course congress will spend more regardless of who controls congress that is why budgets matter that is why this arcane and esoteric gimmick in this bill matters it is why we should have these debates in the budget committee it is why this congress should pass a budget it is why we should let the national defense bill be about defense rather than mortgaging our future look if it wasnt enough to have this budget smokeandmirrors debate in the defense bill this years ndaa also has a debate about whether we should let taxpayer dollars subsidize discrimination and whether we should encourage corporate misconduct i am not going to dwell long on the subsidization of discrimination and encouraging corporate misconduct but i cant fathom why there would be a place in this bill about national defense for provisions that allow federal contractors to discriminate against lgbt employees that is unacceptable bizarre and contrary to meeting the security needs of our nation also included in this bill is an exemption from the presidents fair pay and safe workplace executive order the place to debate that is in another committee i serve on the education and the workforce committee not the national defense bill those need to be removed of course this bill also strikes the selective service registration for women the committee mark included women in selective service personally i cosponsor a bill with representative mike coffman to eliminate selective service that would save money and of course in my entire lifetime there has not been a draft if we are going to have a selective service system of course it needs to include women women serve in every single combat role it needs to include everybody so we can mobilize manpower and womanpower most effectively but unfortunately that has been stripped out of this bill i believe we should take a hard look at doing away with selective service entirely of course at the very least we should include both men and women at the age of 18 to move forward without any real debate on this issue and to strike that section without meaningful floor debate is bad policy bad procedure it is an offense to the committee which put it into the bill and yet another reason i plan on opposing the bill there are other pieces of this bill which i and many democrats and republicans object to there is a lot of time to go into those which i will do

6 legislative days before there is a government shutdown6 legislative daysand instead of tackling this we are once again debating another republican attack on womens health in 6 legislative days the government might shut down and i am worried because judging from recent events within the republican caucus the right hand doesnt know what the extreme right hand is doing they cant seem to get along with each other and i am afraid yet there will be another catastrophe and everything will come to a halt and the people that will suffer will be the people of this country whom we are supposed to represent in fact the republicans were in such a hurry to waste our time with this destructive legislation that one of the bills we are considering h r 3504 had no hearingsnot one noneno markup and this is the first time we are seeing the billand no amendments by the way nobody can offer an amendment it is totally closed whatever happened to regular order this process stinks and it is indefensible of all the measures that have come before the rules committee more than 75 percent have completely ignored regular order and were rushed to the floor without a legislative hearing and markup denying the peoples elected representatives the opportunity to hear the experts and speak up for their constituents well when you look at the politically motivated legislation that regularly comes before this body i guess it is easy to see why this is not how the peoples house is supposed to work late last night the republican majority of the rules committee took another shortcut through a process called selfexecuting that let them slip an amendment offered by mrs ellmers into todays legislation to redirect funding away from planned parenthood facilities under regular order this amendment would have required three waiversthree it would require three waivers from the committee to be considered on the house floor on top of that the ellmers amendment would have also violated section 302 f of the congressional budget act which prohibits the consideration of legislation that exceeds a committees allocation of budget authority but the republicancontrolled rules committee said who cares we are in charge we dont care about the rules we dont want to be fair we dont want to be open we dont want to be transparent we are in charge and we can do whatever we want this is just another attempt by the house majority to shut out debate on important issues and ignore the house rules when it is convenient for them during this congress alone 118 waivers have been granted 115 of those waivers 97 percent have been for republicans instead of the house rules committee we should be known as the house breaktherules committee because that is all the rules committee seems to do it breaks rules goes around rules and tries all kinds of trickery to be able to force legislation to the floor that limits debate and doesnt allow members to offer amendments this legislative process in this house has become a joke it is shameful and this is not serious legislating with one bill after another republicans have repeatedly hurt our countrys most vulnerable families and these bills today are just the latest chapter this is nothing new one of the first acts of the republican house majority in 2011 was to drive us to the brink of a government shutdown over planned parenthood in october 2013 republicans did shut down the government by insisting on defunding the affordable care act now 2 years later they are right back to threatening a republican government shutdown over planned parenthood h r 3134 the socalled defund planned parenthood act of 2015 is a bad and a backwardthinking bill in the 114th congress the house has already taken four antiwomens health votes and today sets the stage for us to take two additional votes to restrict womens access to womens health care incredibly this is already twice the number of antiwomens health votes than at this same point in the 113th and 112th congressesand this congress is not even half over in this republican congress facts dont matter we dont talk about facts they are inconvenient and they are a nuisanceespecially when they get in the way of their extremist political agenda the fact is that planned parenthood plays a critical role in protecting and providing access to critical health services for both women and men one in five women has relied on a planned parenthood health center for care in her lifetime and planned parenthood serves 2 7 million patients each year one of the most important statistics that my republican friends like to ignore is that more than 90 percent of what planned parenthood does nationally is preventive care including cervical cancer screenings breast cancer screenings and family planningnot abortion services i just came from a luncheon a few minutes ago where we were honoring individuals who were leaders in the cancer prevention field people who have advocated that it is important for all of us to be able to get checkups on a regular basis in order to prevent cancer and here we are about to vote on a bill that if the republicans get their way would limit and would eliminate access to lifesaving cancer screenings for countless individuals across this country what are you thinking this is not the way we should be proceeding add to this the fact that planned parenthood clinics are often one of the few affordable healthcare options available for many womennearly 80 percent of women using planned parenthood clinics have incomes at or below 150 percent of povertyand it is easy to see why a majority of americans dont think federal funding should be eliminated in one recent poll 63 percent of voters including 72 percent of independents do not agree with my republican friends that federal funding for planned parenthood should be eliminated we have also heard very little from my friends on the other side of the aisle about the consequences that defunding for planned parenthood would have for families across the country one of the biggest myths perpetrated by republicans is the idea that our nations community health centerswhich i love adore respect and supportcould somehow magically pick up the slack overnight if planned parenthood is defunded for the millions of lowincome women who depend on planned parenthood clinics this scenario would mean the loss of affordable and accessible contraceptive services and counseling as well as breast and cervical cancer screenings and testing the idea that our community health centers could overnight suddenly step up and cover millions of new patients is simply wrong and shows a fundamental misunderstanding by republicans of how our countrys healthcare system works in fact the guttmacher institute recently found that in 21 percent of counties with a planned parenthood health center planned parenthood is the only safety net family planning provider the report also states in twothirds of the 491 counties in which they are located planned parenthood health centers serve at least half of all women obtaining contraceptive care from safety net health centers in onefifth of the counties in which they are located planned parenthood sites are the sole safety net family planning center this makes clear just how devastating it would be for these communities to recklessly cut funding for these vital health services for the people who need them most everyone here in this congress every single one of us with the snap of our fingers can get health care but with todays bills republicans seem to be saying that for families who are poor or who live in rural areas or where this is the only option for preventive care where they live are simply out of luck talk about cruel i have a recent article from the health affairs blog titled planned parenthood community health centers and womens health getting the facts right it says a claim that community health centers readily can absorb the loss of planned parenthood clinics amounts to a gross misrepresentation of what even the best community health centers in the country would be able to do were planned parenthood to lose over 40 percent of its operating revenues overnight as the result of a ban on federal funding i will enter the full article into the record"], [0.3697631359100342, 0.6302368640899658, 1, "i thank the

justice reform we have serious fundamental problems with our criminal justice system today for too long policymakers have chosen to play politics with crime policy by enacting socalled tough on crime slogans and sound bites such as three strikes and you are out mandatory minimum sentences andif you get it to rhyme apparently it is betterif you do the adult crime you do the adult time as appealing as these policies sound their impacts range from a negligible reduction in crime to actually increasing the crime rate as a result of these policies the united states despite representing only 5 percent of the worlds population has 25 percent of the worlds prisoners and now has the highest incarceration rate of any nations by far in the world there are 2 2 million people behind bars in this country that is triple the number of prisoners we had just three decades ago at over 700 persons incarcerated for every 100 000 in the population the united states far exceeds the worlds average incarceration rate of about 100 per 100 000 recent studies have questioned the sanity of this mass incarceration for example the pew research center on states estimates that after about 350 per 100 000 any crime reduction value begins to diminish and at over 500 per 100 000 incarceration becomes actually counterproductive as i said our rate is now at 700 per 100 000 these counterproductive effects are created because today there are too many children who are being raised by a parent who is in prison and by too many people with felony records who are unable to find jobs the impact of our tax dollars is also distressing the bureau of prisons is consuming too much of the department of justices budget meaning that the department has fewer and fewer resources for other programs that can actually reduce crime and enhance public safety the tough on crime approach falls the hardest on minorities while the incarceration rate overall in the united states is approximately 700 per 100 000 for blacks the incarceration rate is over 2 200 per 100 000 and in some jurisdictions they lock up blacks at the rate of 4 000 per 100 000a rate 40 times the international average the war on drugs has exacerbated this problem over 2 000 federal prisoners are now serving life without parole for nonviolent drug crimes and many more are serving unduly harsh sentences for nonviolent offenses the racial disparities are staggering despite the fact that whites engage in drug offenses at a rate equal to or often higher than that of african americans african americans are incarcerated on drug charges at a rate 10 times greater than that of whites we all agree that there is a problem with mass incarceration so what is the best way to solve it when reviewing any legislative package called criminal justice reform i think there are some key principles that we have to address first reform must meaningfully address the problem of mass incarceration by significantly reducing admissions to prison and shortening a prisoners length of stay second any reform must address the primary driver of the ballooning federal prison populations and that is mandatory minimum penalties especially those for drug and firearm offenses third we must address the disparate impact on race in the federal criminal justice system that has resulted from the application of many neutrally worded policies and laws fourth reform must address mental health and addiction issues as a public health issue and require intervention and treatment plans to resolve underlying issues that led those to be involved in the criminal justice system rather than implement socalled tough on crime lock em up approaches everybody knows that the war on drugs has failed we need to address drug abuse more as a public health issue and less as a criminal justice issue fifth we must provide comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services and incentives for completing those programs that are found to actually work with a particular focus on those with the greatest need finally any legislation must be based on research and evidence not on polltested slogans and sound bites or political negotiations which are unrelated to research and evidence how do the current proposals stack up first we look at the current bills that have been reported out of the house and senate judiciary committees and notice that they fail to embody any of the principles in fact they often take the opposite approach while these bills reduce the number of admissions and or length of stay in some limited cases they also create new mandatory minimums even new mandatory minimums or mandatory consecutive enhancements they enhance existing mandatory minimums to apply to people who would not get them under the present law and they irrationally limit who can benefit from prospective and retroactive relief provisions it is unknown whether there will be an overall increase or decrease in prison impact at the 10year point after implementation if these bills pass compared to doing nothing the united states sentencing commission has been unable to quantify the impact of the expansions or the limitations on relief so the fact that we do not have the numbers means that we cannot determine whether these bills will have any meaningful effect on mass incarceration though the bills do shorten two supersized mandatory minimums they do not eliminate any mandatory minimum the senate bill actually creates two new ones and both bills create new mandatory consecutive sentencing enhancements which must be served after any other sentence both bills expand mandatory minimums for drug and gun offenses by applying them to people who would not be eligible to receive them today if the problem we are trying to address is mass incarceration why are those in the bill to begin with neither of the bills will do anything to address the disparate racial impact that pervades our criminal justice system federal mandatory minimums in particular those for drug and firearm offenses have been studied and have been found to have a racially disparate impact these bills do nothing to eliminate mandatory minimums even though they reduce some they create new ones expand others and create new sentencing enhancements so the bills may actually make racial disparities in sentencing even worse than they are under present law finally both bills put limits on who can receive prospective and retroactive relief if you look at the limitations you will find that they have a racially disparate impact on minorities on the issue of the war on drugs both bills also fail to treat drug abuse and addiction as a public health problem in fact the strategy used in the bills to address heroin addiction is not a public health approach for the bills impose mandatory additional prison time this is not a public health researchbased approach on the comprehensive reentry and rehabilitation services to reduce recidivism these bills have turned science and empirical evidence upside down they give the greatest incentives for completing the programs to those with the lowest need while categorically barring offenders with the highest risk from benefiting from the rehabilitation programs this approach not only violates research but it will exacerbate the current racial disparities in the criminal justice system there is ample research available to show what credible criminal justice reform ought to look like for example texasone of the nations most conservative statesrecently passed criminal justice reform legislation that was based on research and evidence and the result was a significant reduction in crime a significant reduction in incarceration and a savings of billions of dollars"], [0.3715275526046753, 0.6284724473953247, 1, "you have

virus we also now know through health professionals that it is sexually transmitted we know that the entire united states is vulnerable but most of the vulnerable states are in the gulf region it is time now to address the question of funding without riders like preventing planned parenthood from getting funding and without riders for allowing the confederate flag to be in a veterans cemetery where is our concern about the american peoplefor the people in louisiana with a lot of water for the people in texas with a lot of water in florida in puerto rico it is important that this funding comes now to rapidly expand mosquito control programs and to accelerate a vaccine that is really importantto be able to provide the american people with a vaccine they are in the midst of the research they need the funding the cdc and the nih have reprogrammed more money than they have to try to help those who are desperate i make the argument that it is time now for us to do the job the other body needs to engage in providing a bill and this body this house needs to stop playing those kinds of politics and provide the fundingthe funding that does not take from ebola but the funding that the american people need to be safe we are currently in a state of a public health crisis as a result of the growing rate of zika infections across the country sadly we are failing as our nations leaders in our ability to respond to this crisis as days and month go by it is alarming and the level of action and inaction my colleagues are taking to hamper the ability of our federal government to respond to this rapidly growing public threat in particular i am concerned that weas a body of congresshave not taken the critical steps to move forward and appropriate necessary funding that will help screen treat vaccinate and test deadly cases of zika infections according to the coalition for sensible safeguards congress should be looking for ways to strengthen our nations regulatory system by identifying gaps and instituting new sciencebased safeguards for the public i cannot agree moreas we are now in perilous times where the zika virus presents unprecedented threats to the people of our nation as cited by tom frieden director of the centers for disease control and prevention and anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the national institutes of health in an oped dated august 21 2016 there have been more than 16 800 cases of zika infection reported to the centers for disease control and prevention in the unitedstates and its territories including more than 2 700 on the mainland laboratory tests have confirmed that 1 595 pregnant women have been infected with the virus and tragically 17 babies have been born with birth defects related to zika as highlighted by frieden and fauci we have an obligation to meet the zika threat and protect this country as the potential cost of a funding shortfall will be measured in human misery and even death now is not the time to pass measures or engage in futile debates that will undermine or slow the ability of our federal and local governments to address and respond to this growing threat and active cases of zika infections rather we need to invest in stopping this deadly but preventable virus before it is too late we cannot afford to stand by with our hands tied any longer our limited time as the days in september wain down cannot be wasted we should be focused on the crucial mission of protecting our nations people that is why in these critical times of need i am calling upon my colleagues to place the growing epidemic of the zika virus at the top of our priorities and demand no less than fully financed measures to timely and adequately respond to this devastating and deadly public health emergency how to fight zika and cure nations ail"], [0.3724389672279358, 0.6275610327720642, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i think it is important for us all to really understand what is taking place here today first of all i want to warn against misleading information when we keep hearing that those stack of papers represent the billthat the bill is 1 800 pages longthat is not the case as a matter of fact the chairman of the committee knows that 171 pages are simply sample model forms to say to the banks these are the kind of forms that you need and you can take these samples and use them 63 pages are description of the rationale behind the rule why do we have this rule 15 pages are summarizing the rulemaking process 308 pages with sectionbysection analysis so that is not the bill those pages that you see the props that are being used if we go to the beginning of this you have to understand that it was doddfrank that decided they wanted to make this process more easily understood by the consumers out of the doddfrank legislation they are the ones that combined both tila and respa into this integrated disclosure form to make it simpler so despite the fact that the banks and the industry haveparticularly the big banksthousands of employees millions of dollars doing big trades et cetera et cetera they said we really cant get our act together in the length of time that is given us with this rule so for some of us who thought well you know they are very wellstaffed they have a lot of money they could really do this but we will take them at their word and not only that some of us on the democratic side said we would take them at their word mr cordray led the effort in saying all right there should be a grace period i dont care what my chairman said if mr cordray did not say it in the exact words the way that he wanted him to say it that is just too bad but the fact of the matter is he did say it that he would support a grace period and that is what we have all done so given that he has said that given that we have support for it on the democratic side and the republican side really there is no need for the bill this is just taking up precious time and energy for something that is not needed i think i know why there is such a fight for this legislation because it includes in it something that would protect the lenders even when they make a big mistake we talk about good faith but i want to tell you what is included in this integrated disclosure people are talking about real issues here will the loan amount be the same that the consumer has agreed upon will the interest rate be the same or will somehow there be a little mistake instead of 3 8 in interest rates it is going to end up 4 2 or 4 3 if that happens what can the consumer do if you dont give them the right to go into court basically they can do nothing and the lender can say too bad about that we cannot treat consumers that way we have to give them the right to have their day in court and even with the burden being on the consumer to have to prove that the lender acted in good faith the consumer needs to have the right to go and make the case and so my amendment that was not allowed in the rules committee and we did not get a chance to come to the floor and debate it because they closed down the rule simply means that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle said we dont care what you are saying about protecting the consumers we know that there could be some mistakes however we say if those mistakes are made it was in good faith they didnt really mean to do it and no the consumer doesnt have a right to go into the court and make the case that is not right it should not happen as our leader has said we have gone through a period of time where this country almost had a depression we certainly did have a recession because the big banks and too many of the banks and financial institutions in this country came up with all of these exotic products people were misled they signed on the dotted line for mortgages that many of them could not afford these mortgages reset and people ended up paying higher interest rates 6 months or a year after they signed on the dotted line they didnt know they didnt understand so you can say that the banks who treated the consumers this way were acting in good faith and they didnt intend to do it but we know enough now that we cannot depend on representations of i didnt mean it if you didnt mean it you shouldnt have done it and if you did it you need to be able to be dealt with in a court of law so here we are with this legislation and if you had not put that part in the legislation there would not even have to be a discussion you are absolutely right it could have been on suspension or there could not have been a bill at all but no the concern about the consumer is not what appears to be foremost in the minds of those who would dismiss their opportunity to go to court we should not treat our consumers that way we should have learned our lesson we should have learned our lesson folks who are buying a home maybe for the first time and this is the biggest decision and this is the biggest credit action that they are going to make in their lifetime they need to have some assurances that they are being treated right why do you think we have all of these disclosure laws before these disclosure laws were developed people were misled they ended up with balloon payments prepayment penalties on and on and on we are saying yes lets have a grace period lets allow the banks to use this time to get their house in order they can train their staff they can get their papers together we agree to all of that that is not an issue and we say it over and over again because we dont want anybody to be misled that somehow we are standing in the way of the great spirit we are not doing that we agree to that what we are standing in the way of is abuse of our consumers we created this consumer financial protection bureau because our consumers did not have the protection that they needed our regulators didnt pay attention to consumers they were supposed to be there not only to deal with the possible risks in the system et cetera and the consumers but nobody was looking out for the consumers so this is the centerpiece of doddfrank reforms the consumer financial protection bureau the centerpiece of doddfrank is to protect consumers and not allow them to be tricked not allow them to be misled not allow them to be prevented from going to court you can describe it any way that you want to describe it but the fact of the matter is you are either with the consumers or you are not we on this side of the aisle for the most part are telling you over and over again that we are with the great spirit we are not with your actions and that part of the bill that will not allow our consumers to be protected and you can protest all you want you cannot tell me if ms jones in signing on the dotted line ends up with a higher interest rate than she thought she was getting and if she does not have the right to go into court what happens who is going to protect her if she does not have the right to go into court and make the case and show that this is not simply an error of a comma or a period this is an action that does not show good faith this is an action that will cause me to pay hundreds of more dollars for my loan that i had not anticipated consumers should not be treated that way consumers should be protected in every possible way that we can because in the final analysis that is why they send us to congress to be able to be their voice to speak for them we on this side of the aisle will continue to do that in spite of the tricks of the trade that are being employed by others i yield back the balance of my time"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.6233159303665161, 0.6233159303665161, 0, "i yield myself such time as may i consume the question before us today is really pretty simple is america going to shape the global economy or is it going to shape us ninetyfive percent of the worlds consumers they dont live in this country they live in other countries so if we want to create more jobs in america we have got to make more things here in america and sell them over there in fact one out of every five jobs in america already today depends on trade and you know what that is a good thing because these jobs pay more they pay on average 18 percent more but while the world is moving full steam ahead we have been standing still we havent completed a trade agreement in years today there are 262 free trade agreements in place across the world we are a party to 14 since 2007 when the last version of trade promotion authority expired there have been 100 trade agreements negotiated and signed the unitedstates is a party to none of those china is negotiating seven agreements right now including one with 16 countries in the global economy if you are standing still you are falling behind because all these other countries are negotiating agreements without us what that basically means is other countries are lowering their trade barriers between those countries as a result of them lowering their trade barriers making their products more affordable getting more market share they are putting up barriers against our products making it harder for us to get access to those markets big companies can set up a factory in another country make something there and sell it there getting trade agreements means removing those barriers so we keep those factories here so all businesses big and small can make things in america grow things in america and sell them overseas let me just give you an example since the year 2000 there have been 48 trade agreements in east asia alone america has been a party to only two of them and as a result of that our share of their imports fell by 42 percent the rules of the global economy are being written right now that is not the question the question is are we going to write the rules of the global economy with our allies or are we going to let other countries write the rules such as china this is why h r 1314 the trade act would establish tpa or trade promotion authority now there has been a lot of confusion about this bill a lot of honest confusion and sometimes a lot of intentional confusion let me say really clearly what this bill is tpa is not a trade deal tpa is not a trade agreement tpa is a process for negotiating a trade agreement congress is not considering a trade agreement today there is no secret agreement that nobody has read that is being voted on today all we are voting on today is a process by which congress considers trade agreements the earliest we would do so would be in the fall at the earliest why should we care about this process because a good process gets us a good result this tpa will give us the leverage that we in congress need to get a fair deal for the american worker because when other countries know that the deal that they agreed to is a deal congress will vote on they will give us their best offers countries arent going to give us a good agreement if they have to negotiate with 535 people here is how it works congress says to the president when you submit a trade agreement we will give you an upordown vote on three conditions first you have got to pursue specific negotiating objectives 150 of them here is what we want to see in a trade agreement and here is what cannot be in a trade agreement second you have got to keep us informed you have got to regularly consult with congress congress must have access to all of the negotiating texts right now it is whatever the administration chooses to give us they control it they decide on their terms with tpa congress says no no no we in congress get access to these negotiating documents while it is being negotiated we in congress are accredited to go to the negotiations if we want to and with the zinke protocol which we added to this if we ourselves cant make it we will send representatives for ourselves to these negotiations third and perhaps most importantly transparency in the old days they used to call this thing fast track president goes out and gets an agreement and then wham whizzes it through has congress vote on it it is in law everybodys wondering what the heck just happened what is in this thing not again no more when an agreement is reached when america gets an agreement with other countries before the president can even sign off on it we make it public for 60 days up on the internet everybody can read it for themselves and see what it is that is in this law never done that before and then the president can sign it but when he signs it it doesnt go into effect when he signs it it just means he sends it to congress and then congress considers it congress considers it and congress determines whether it is going to happen or not it is a bill like any other bill congress has to pass it they have to affirmatively pass it for it to go into effect and if the house of representatives doesnt like the trade agreement and they vote it down with a simple majority vote it doesnt happen that is what this bill does we have the final say i understand a lot of our members especially on our side of the aisle they dont trust this administration join the club neither do i that is precisely why i support this bill tpa puts congress in the drivers seat the world is watching this the world is watching whether or notand they are trying to make a decisionis america still america or is america in retreat our allies want our leadership our adversaries are measuring how much we stack up our enemies would love for us to retreat the world is watching as to whether or not america is going to lead in the world whether america in the dawn of the 21st century is going to take command of writing the rules of the global economy or cede that command to other countries if we establish tpa we are saying on a bipartisan basis we want america to lead we believe in our country we believe in our workers we believe in our economy we want to open up markets so that we can use american ingenuity and american workers to create american jobs so we can sell our goods and our services and our products overseas so we can create more goodpaying jobs right here at home that is what this is about it is about getting us on the playing field there have been 100 trade agreements negotiated signed since 2007 when tpa last expired we are a party to zero of those the rest of the world is moving around the rest of the world is getting better deals the rest of the world is

states where good peoplemen and womenworking in the coal mines literally power america they come from an industrythey work in the coal mines they support the coal minersan industry that provides affordable and reliable energy that powers the american economy and has been the backbone of the american economy instead of celebrating that industry instead of applauding the heroic work that these men and women do day in and day out underground and above ground what is the response of the federal government over the last 6 years it has been to singularly punish this industry i cant think of an administration from either party in the history of the united states that has singled out a single industry with the level of vindictiveness frankly and targeted a single industry and literally bankrupted many of these companies i dont understand it for a variety of reasons but let me just share with you a little bit about the coal industry in kentucky we could very well be the poster child for demonstrating the tremendous negative impact and the consequences of this heartless aggressive anticoal policy from the epa and from this administrations regulatory policy since 2009 the commonwealth of kentucky has lost more than 8 000 coal mining jobs throughout our state for every one coal mining job three additional jobs are directly tied to every coal mining job this is a direct result of the administrations war on coal sure there are competitive pressures from natural gas and we celebrate the fracking boom and the result of discoveries in natural gas but i can tell you what the coal industry says it is not cheap natural gas that is the cause of these lost jobs it is the fact that the federal government has put its heavy hand of regulatory power on the scales to make this industry noncompetitive just to give you a sample of the problem in the first quarter of 2015 alone kentuckys coal employment numbers dropped another 101 2 percent what does that mean in total coal production in kentucky has decreased to its lowest level since 1963 in 2015 production levels are currently half of what they were just two decades ago yet demand for energy in the united states has suddenly increased there are more than just statistics when it comes to talking about the face of the war on coal many of my colleagues have shared these stories about what this really means what all of these regulations really mean in the real world it is not statistics on a page it is not about coal production percentages on decline what it is really about it is about sally the young woman in wolfe county kentucky that i met with tears in her eyes at the end of a townhall meeting she came to me as her congressman and she said do they know what they are doing to our family my husband lost his job because the coal mining employer that he works for didnt get a permit and so now he is out of work dont those people in washington understand that i have got kids we are going back to school it is august and i cant afford shoes for my kids i had to go to walmart and buy them flipflops just so they wouldnt be embarrassed to go back to school now i want the regulators in washington d c to come back to kentucky to eastern kentucky and meet sally and look sally in the eye and ask her to describe to them what the impact of this war on coal is for her what about robert robert the coal miner from wolfe county kentucky in my district he gets up at 3 every morning to commute an hour to go to work in the coal mines just to put food on the table or what about james who looks at me with an incredible expression and says andy dont they understand what they are doing they are putting people out of work they are making life harder on the american people surely these are the people who say they are fighting for the working man i am the working man congressman what are they thinking then you talk about chris chris who says congressman i dont know much about politics i dont really care much about politics but if you can go save my job i am for you cant the politicians in washington fight for people just to go to work and provide for their families these are paychecks that these people depend on finally it is curtis curtis who said to me that his father crawled on his belly for decades to take care of his family and because of his fathers hard work he had opportunities this

virginia ohio pennsylvania kentuckyand look these people in the eye and ask them what they think about their policies worst of all it is all done in the name of the environment we all love the environment these coal miners love the environment they come from a beautiful part of the country in appalachia it is not about not wanting to help the environment or environmental stewardship but what is so sad is that these regulations arent going to do a darn thing about global carbon emissions the clean power plan rule that this administration has proposed would reduce global carbon

to lead this special order on what is one of the most critical issues facing our nation in generations now i know that sounds dramatic and that it sounds like it is a statement that is just designed to capture peoples attention but it is actually true this is a question that will define our safety and our security for generations to come the question we face and the issue that we want to address tonight is will the unitedstates and the international community allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon for generations it has been the policy of republican and democratic administrations that we would not allow that to happen it is critical to the security of our friends and allies in the region that we are successful in denying them this it is critical to our own national security to the interests at home and to our interests abroad that we not allow iran to nuclearize their weapons program so we come to this question will we allow that to happen tonight i stand here along with many of my colleagues to express my great concern about what the president is doing and the state of the negotiations as they are now tomorrow we get to hear from the prime minister of israel i look forward to hearing his comments he certainly has as they say a dog in this fight but so do we let me begin by telling you a little bit about my background i spent 14 years as a pilot in the air force i flew the b1 at one point i was the pilot rep for the implementation of the strategic arms reduction talks or start i and start ii implementing a treaty that we had with the former soviet union this was a very interesting experience i learned a lot from this i certainly learned of the details and the necessity of following through with every tiny detail of these treaties and of implementing them our russian counterparts could show up at our base at any time with only a fewhours notice they had access to the most highly sensitive areas they would measure they would observe they would talk they had incredibly sophisticated ways of verifying that we were complying with elements of the start treaty as we did with russia these elements in my opinion are one of the keys to making sure that this treaty that the president is negotiating is successful which brings us then to really one of our central questions because i learned from my own experience that for a treaty as sophisticated as this would have to be to be successful there has to be a modicum of trust an element of trust between the two partiesa grain a core of trustwhere they both want the treaty to succeed i dont know if we have that now i had the opportunity to address this concern with secretary kerry just last week i asked him very simply can you name me a single example where the united states or our allies for generations have had a positive constructive experience with iran can you show me any example of how they have worked with us in a positive manner he could not provide me with a single example once again this is one of the central questions that we have to address so lets ask this question can we trust iran let me explain to you why i think the answer to that is no you see this map beside me this indicates irans range of influence around the world and it reaches as you see from north korea through central asia through the middle east through parts of europe to south america and to mexico iran has been a state sponsor of terrorism for more than 30 years they by themselves have developed an extensive military complexthe defense industries organization as they call it the dio is able to supply iran with all of the materials that they need in order to carry out their terrorist activities around the worldall of the ammunition all of the equipment all of the weapons in fact iran is the primary supplier of the weapons and ammunition of two other officially recognized state sponsors of terrorsudan and syria it is the primary sponsor of a number of listed foreign terrorist organizations including hezbollah and hamas and numerous shia militias in iraq iran has directed the terrorist activities of numerous of these shia militias and let me point out this fact over the last dozen years or so these iranianbacked militias have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of american soldiers working in the theater hundreds of american soldiers have lost their lives due to the direct activities of iran as i mentioned and as you can see on the map they engage in narcotics trafficking and human smuggling in mexico in the triborder area of brazil and argentina and paraguay hezbollah has a safe haven for recruiting training and fundraising even venezuela is similarly a safe haven in india they provide support for syed kalbe jawad who is recruiting shia militias to fight in iraq and syria they cooperate with north korea in cyber warfare the list of their interventions in a negative and a destructive way around the world is indeed very long they are a strategic ally of russia and china they provide port facilities they are a strategic ally of north korea they have cooperated with north korea to develop ballistic missiles so once again let me come back to my conversation with the secretary of state where i ask him can you give us a single example of a positive or constructive alliance or agreement or partnership that we have had with this nation of iran and the answer has once again been no iranian leaders have stated their objective is to destroy israel and of course the great satan the unitedstates in fact i can show you look at this picture and you may wonder what it is it is not something taken from world war ii or from another war this actually happened last week where iran completed a successful exercise in a simulated attack on a unitedstates aircraft carrier does that sound like the activity of a potential partner hezbollah has stockpiled approximately 60 000 surfacetosurface rockets in lebanon hamas has stockpiled approximately 10 000 surfacetosurface rockets in gaza iran is of course the primary supplier of both of these and their stated purpose is to destroy israel to wipe it off the map as the current iranian president rouhani said the zionist regime has been a wound in the body of the islamic world for years and the wound should be removed the former president said in 2012 that iran has no roots in the middle east and that it would be eliminated so let me conclude my part of this hour by emphasizing once again that iran has demonstrated several generations now of destructive warlike deadly activities around the world designed to destroy israel designed to weaken or destroy the united states killing american soldiers overseas and this is the partner that we think we can trust with one of the most critical issues of our day i hope the president realizes the danger that we would face if they prove not to be a reliable partner i will let others share in my time today first i would like

of reasonable agreement that would contain irans nuclear ambitions i do not trust this administration as it approaches the reversal of a half century of nuclear nonproliferation policy as chairman royce stated over the weekend the obama administrations fundamental misread of the iranian regime is part of what makes this potential agreement so dangerous to our national security the sanctions

ambitions of the worlds leading state sponsor of terrorism if the past is any indication of the future we can expect that iran will continue to employ its stonewalling tactics blocking any real transparency or inspections of its nuclear facilities why isnt iran answering questions asked 4 years ago by the international atomic energy agency about their past activities how can we trust a country that wont answer simple questions or allow scientists to be interviewed how can we set up a sanctions relief system that is based on trust and verification if the country has proven objectively incapable of trust and transparency we certainly cannot continue to overlook iranian compliance failures as reported this week in the washington post nor come anywhere close to lifting its successfully firm arms embargo these negotiations will have longterm implications on every country on this planet i believe the united states has a responsibility to stand with israel and other allies

promised 7 years ago that he would not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon he is failing to keep that promise to the american people and the rest of the world in my opinion the stakes are too high

really entirely aware how timely the topic would be today i am so pleased that you did organize this so thank you now many of us are still reviewing the text having just received the 150 pages that make up this deal with iran but from what i have heard thus far it leaves me highly skeptical that the accord that was reached does not advance our interests in the region and signifies a retreat from the world stage let me first say that even if we take the president at his word the words that i heard this morningand we assume for a second that this deal cuts off every pathway to a nuclear weapon there are still significant ramifications for granting 150 billion in sanctions relief to a country whose unofficial motto that we just heard from the gentlewoman of missouri has become death to america as israeli ambassador dermer told some of my constituents just last night at a christians united for israel speech a 150 billion infusion of cash into irans coffers is like a trillion dollars flowing into the united states treasury and that money will go toward funding the ayatollahs terror machines ranging from assads regime in syria hezbollah in lebanon the houthis in yemen hamas the islamic jihad in gaza and the many other of irans terror proxies throughout the region this is compounded by the fact that the deal will lift the conventional arms embargo in iran in no more than 5 years and the embargo on missile sales to iran in no more than 8 years what the deal appears to do is give the iranian regime 150 billion in sanctions relief while simultaneously allowing them to buy more conventional weapons weapons that we know have been used in the past to actually kill american soldiers now this isnt to mention the unintended consequence that effectively shreds our foreign policy playbook that has guided the unitedstates on the world stage for decades this is a historic mistakenot only what prime minister netanyahu has said is a historic mistake for the world but it will allow iran to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region as the congresswoman from missouri said it will start a nuclear arms race in the middle east just today former cia director general hayden testified that not only do we need to understand that our nuclear focus does not make other realities go away even if we had a successful conclusion to these nuclear negotiations issues will remain i just want to close by reminding what our issues will iran include we know and believe they are the largest state supporter sponsor of terrorism they hold american hostages without a fair trial they support palestinian terrorism and they destabilize iraq where we have invested so much treasure and lives hayden concluded the issue is not just irans nuclear

and thus cannot afford a deal with unacceptable terms"], [0.6017465591430664, 0.6017465591430664, 0, "thank you for yielding and congressman dold thank you for your leadership on this issue i am very grateful i represent the savannah river site in aiken and barnwell counties of south carolina i had the privilege of working with congressman jim clyburn very bipartisan a portion of this site is located in allendale county south carolina we have worked together on the issues relative to the savannah river site which should be noted is where the defense waste is currently being placed it is a consequence of the cold war but it also is a consequence of victory in the cold war i know that the persons who worked in the savannah river site are very very grateful for the opportunities that they have had to provide for the protection of the american people and it has been successful it is particularly meaningful to me because i am the only member of congress that actually worked at the savannah river site so i know firsthand that it is really very professional and it is also very environmentally sound we were talking about why are we here for me it is due to the environment and jobs the environment we know is in danger if we have different sites around the country that could be addressed in the department of energy i have another distinction i was very grateful to be the deputy general counsel of the department of energy in 1981 and 1982 the defense waste bill came up through that time it was determined that there should be a geologic formation to place the waste of our country whether it be defense waste or whether it be commercial it was determinedand i know that you will be going through this to explainthat indeed yucca mountain is ideal none of us would ever want to put any community any state at risk but we know well that yucca would not be of risk to the people of the west but it would be very sound and it would be very environmentally secure and it would also indeed help create jobs our state has been so fortunate to have the savannah river site but we also have another distinction we are one of the most nuclearintensive states in the country nearly 60 percent of all the power that is produced in the state of south carolina for almost 30 years has been nuclear we know what the consequence of this is and that is that we have reliable energy we have green clean energy and we have a level of inexpensive energy which has a consequence of promoting jobs the jobs that have been created are quite selfevident in our state we have a circumstance with the providing of lowcost energy south carolina nowparticularly with the development of the bmw facility at greer south carolina of all thingsis the leading exporter of cars in the united states creating jobs in our state our region but then providing for extraordinary export around the world additionally south carolina is the leading manufacturer of tires right next to the savannah river site is the bridgestone facility and this is a japanese investment over 1 billion then right down 120 not far in the district i represent is the michelin facility there are two plants adjacent to each other i was there recently with ambassador gerard araud of france because we appreciate the french investment in fact the michelin facility is the largest michelin facility in the world nearly 2 million square feet with nearly 2 000 employees again this is because of the success that we have with nuclear power then further down 120 we are very grateful of a german investment continental tires has just announced that they just completed a halfbilliondollar facility in south carolina then we also welcome from singapore the giti tire company which has announced a quarterofabilliondollar facility to be located in the upper part of south carolina over and over again it is because we have safe secure clean energy in fact i want to commend the obama administration they actually have provided for the licensing of three new nuclear reactors in our country two are located at the v c summer facility at jenkinsville south carolina which is again adjacent to the district i represent in fairfield county and then directly across the savannah river from the district that i represent is the vogtle plant at waynesboro georgia we are very supportive of these all of them will be so helpful to achieve the environmentally very important determination of a geologic formation then there is an economic side just as the people of illinois the people of south carolina and also the people of pennsylvania have through their rates paid over 1 billion into the fund to build yucca so our people are invested we have done it in good faith and we need to follow the law the law is that indeed this be the geologic formation which is safe for the american people and creating the opportunity for jobs a final point south carolina has taken this so seriously i want to commend our governor nikki haley i also want to commend our attorney general alan wilson they have actually filed a suitand it was inspired largely by unitedstates senator lindsey graham and unitedstates senator tim scottto enforce the law the law needs to be enforced it would be beneficial to the people of our state and it would be beneficial to our region of south carolina and georgia but it would also be beneficial to the american people i want to thank you for your leadership on this issue so the american people understand how environmentally sound this is how positive it is the energy that is being produced because of this and then the potential for jobs not just in our region but across the united states"], [0.6016327738761902, 0.6016327738761902, 0, "i want to thank my friends as led by our friend congressman ted yoho from florida and our friend from georgia brother hice we heard great comments from dr gosar and our friend steve king from iowa these are deeply troubling times and the supreme court taking up united states v texas really accentuates that issue sometimes it is nice to just pause and pay tribute to folks for example a beautiful couple here it is a pastor his name is pastor jesse estrada sabillon and his wife maria sabillon they are with their granddaughter in this picture they are a beautiful couple you can feel the love emanating from the picture pastor jesse estrada sabillon was a baptist minister at nuevo amanecer baptist church of houston in the cloverleaf area he was an excellent carpenter he owned a home remodeling business j j sons remodeling his wife maria you can tell she loves her granddaughterwas a retired home caregiver for children with special needs they were a beautiful couple mr sabillon never accepted a salary from the church and instead relied upon his job as a carpenter to feed his family so it appears that pastor sabillon was working and acting in the vein of the apostles peter and paul particularly paul didnt want to be a burden to others so he made tents sewed and did whatever he needed to so that he wasnt a burden to others instead of being a burden to others pastor sabillon and his wife maria were a blessing to texas they were a blessing to the houston area and to so many whom they helped the special needs kids that maria helped with it appears that jesse pastor sabillon was doing what jesus said to do to be a light to others to be salt to the world to administer to others needs or as jesus told peter if you love me you will tend my flock well pastor sabillon did that and apparently did that very well this story april 15 alexis de larosa sosa 21 is a mexican national who entered the united states illegally hcso apparently harris county sheriffs office public information officer ryan sullivan confirmed in a phone interview with breitbart texas his intake by this he means alexis de larosa sosa form says unitedstates citizen no alien status illegal de larosa sosa was wanted in connection with a street racing crash where pastor jesse estrada sabillon and his wife maria sabillon were killed the couple was driving home tuesday night after visiting their niece who had just given birth to a baby when they were struck by the truck the suspect is reported to have fled the scene following the crash and did not turn himself in until friday morning about 10 local time he was allegedly driving a 2006 chevy pickup truck and was said to be racing with a darkcolored dodge challenger or charger the houston chronicle reported on wednesday the two vehicles were said to be racing along the sam houston tollway feeder road when de larosa sosa is reported to have run a red light striking the 2004 bmw 330 driven by sabillon the couple were both pronounced dead at the scene of the crash de larosa sosa is said to have fled the scene on foot the driver of the dodge fled the scene in his vehicle officials with the harris county sheriffs office quickly notified the family of the pastor who expressed relief at the news talking about the apprehension of the suspect de larosa sosa is currently processing into the harris county jail and has not yet made a court appearance he is expected to be charged in connection with the two homicides and fleeing the scene of the fatal accident we know there are some wonderful people who have come into this country illegally there have been but there is no question that criminals have taken advantage of the situation to cross our border since it has been porous and to inflict crime on people of the united states there should be little doubt about that and then we have this story from the washington free beacon number of children illegally crossing border up 1 200 percent between 2011 and 2014 ironically it just happens to be as people were finding out south of our border and in other parts of the world that if you make it into the united states illegally then you are probably going to stay odds are 97 percent you will stay as border patrolmen have told me drug cartels across our southern border call our border patrol our homeland security the logistics and they laughingly say if they get people illegally into the country then homeland security is the logistics that ships them wherever they want them to go in the country as i have seen a number of times in the middle of the night as people are being processed and like for example the one older lady who was asked how much she paid some would say 6 000 some would say 7 000 5 000 or 8 000 on a number of occasions a border patrolman has challenged them where did you get that kind of money you dont have that kind of money it normally took repeated questioning to elicit an answer well i paid 1 800 from family in this place some people sent 2 000 from the united states and i am going to pay the rest by working it off in the united states they tell them where they want to go amazingly homeland security has shipped people that have come into the country illegally all over the country we have reports about mexican drug distribution in all of our major cities when you know that homeland security is shipping people that still owe the drug cartels money into different cities it is not hard to figure out how they are getting some of their less than happy workers helping them with their drug distribution this article from adam kredo says in this washington free beacon the number of children apprehended on the unitedstates border attempting to immigrate illegally has surged more than 1 200 percent since 2011 and the number of these children crossing the border during 2016 could be another record according to a newly released government report the number of unaccompanied alien children uacs illegally crossing the unitedstates border has increased sharply since 2011 with a surge of more than 1 200 percent just between 2011 and 2014 according to the congressional research service the agency also disclosed that the flow is increasing significantly in the first 5 months of fiscal the illegal immigration of these children hit recordbreaking numbers in 2014 with unitedstates officials apprehending more than 52 000 alien children nearly 20 000 have been apprehended within the first 5 months of 2016 setting the stage for another potentially recordbreaking year this unexpected surge of children strained unitedstates government resources and created a complex crisis of humanitarian implications the report said they increased in the first 5 months of fy 2016 however and experts warn that significant migration flows will continue until policymakers in the countries of origin and the international community address the poor socioeconomic and security conditions driving central americans to leave their homes that is interesting but i would submit that actually they will continue to surge as long as they are led to believe by the administration and the evidence continues to indicate that they will be allowed to stay in america we will send them where they may claim to have relatives or where the drug cartels tell them to request to be sent just in the last few weeks spending some days and nights on our border our southern border it is heartbreaking what you see because there are people that clearly want a better way of life they are leaving the country of origin because their countries do not enforce the rule of law there is graft there is corruption and the rule of law the law is not evenly and fairly supported and enforced across the board therefore the jobs arent there there are more opportunities here in the united states although we have breakdowns we do try to enforce the law more evenly than i would submit anywhere in the world at least until more recently when this administration makes exceptions of millions of people who are assured that they can violate the law with impunity and will be awarded for it people come from countries where there is no equality under the law and they come to this country as soon as they get here for those of us that were out in front of the supreme court today being shouted down by people who are angry many of them shouting in spanishfinebut we were told that people in their positions were all in the shadows now i did see some people lounging around under a few trees but most of them were not in the shadows they were in fact on the steps of the supreme court right there in front yelling and screaming and showing disrespect for the unitedstates national anthem and yelling trying to prevent freedom of speech it is just really interesting seeing posters like jesus was an immigrant well sort of but he never violated the law he never encouraged anyone else to violate the law in fact he urged people to go forth and do wrong no more but that is not the case the great and really tragic irony of what is taking place is people coming to america illegally demanding that the laws not be properly enforced not be fairly enforced sure there have been millions and millions and millions and millions of americans who have come through our system legally but we are the millions that did not come legally and we demand to have the same treatment as if we did come legally if we do that it will not be long before we will be in the same shape as the countries these people fled from because there is not adequate opportunities since there is not adequate room for the billion or so that we have been told may want to come to america around the world it would be far better to encourage their nations to end graft and corruption to treat people fairly across the board here is an article from the center for immigration studies it says the criminal aliens released by ice in these years who had already been convicted of thousands of crimes are responsible for a significant crime spree in american communities including 124 aliens charged with 135 new homicides inexplicably ice is choosing to release some criminal aliens multiple times these are people that not only came into the country illegally but have committed crimes multiple times many of them while they are here at least they have certainly been charged with them a total of 121 criminal aliens who were freed by ice over the 5year period between 2010 and 2014 were subsequently charged with homiciderelated crimes within that time frame three more were charged in 2015 these 121 accused murderers were associated with 250 different communities in the united states with the most clustered in california new york and texas these aliens were charged with a total of 135 homiciderelated crimes after release two of them had homiciderelated convictions even before they were released these aliens had 464 criminal convictions prior to release by ice another three aliens who were released by ice during that time were charged with homicides during the first 10 months of fy 2015 this tally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions nor those aliens that were released by local law enforcement agencies after ice declined to take them into custody due to obama administration prioritization policies this list includes only those aliens that ice arrested and then released the names of the criminal aliens were redacted by the judiciary committee but the list presumably includes murderers like apolinar altamirano an illegal alien who was arrested by ice in 2013 following his conviction on local charges involving a burglary and abduction but who was released on a 10 000 bond and permitted to remain free and elect to have deportation proceedings that would take years to complete in january 2015 altamirano shot and killed 21yearold grant ronnebeck while he was working at a convenience store where altamirano had come to buy cigarettes ice has previously disclosed that 75 percent of the homicidal criminal aliens were released due to court orders including the socalled zadvydas cases in which the aliens home countries would not take them back the rest were released by ices choice the article also points out in 2014 ice released a total of 30 558 criminal aliens from its custody these aliens had already been convicted of 92 347 crimes before they were released by ice as of july 25 2015 a total of 1 895 aliens have been charged with a crime after being freed by ice in a separate communication ice provided a list of countries that currently are uncooperative in accepting their deported citizens afghanistan algeria burundi cape verde china cuba eritrea gambia ghana guinea india iran iraq ivory coast liberia libya mali mauritania morocco sierra leone somalia south sudan and zimbabwe we have the power to force these countries to either take back their citizens who have come illegally into this country or who are illegally in this countryparticularly if they have committed crimes in this countryor have consequences instead this administration chooses to provide benefits to countries like iran and afghanistan for goodness sake make sure they are running christians and jews out of afghanistan but shouldnt they at least take back their own people i was told by one of the leaders in afghanistanthis is a few years agothat their budget was around 12 billion a year they only provided about 1 5 billion all the rest came from other countries and most of that was from the united states if they wont take their people back then shut the government down they will take their people back this is ridiculous also an important point was made in this article as of july 25 2015 only about 3 percent of the 30 558 criminal aliens freed by ice in 2014 have been removed ice reports that 28 017 still had a pending immigration case as of july 25 2015 but some of them dont show up for their hearings many dont the largest percentage do not they are just given notices to appear recent national gang unitled operations include and this is from a different article from the article ice arrests more than 1 100 in operation targeting gangs it talks about all of the efforts to capture gangs lets see of the 1 133 arrests 915 were gang members and associates 1 001 were charged with criminal offenses and 132 were arrested it is just more and more numbers of drugs firearms currency again about 3 percent apparently is all they are removing of those who are committing crimes in the country jessica vaughan from a year ago had an article from may 28 the nondeported ice still releasing criminal aliens at a rapid pace she documents according to this article the majority of convicted criminal releases occurred because of obama administration policies that require ice officers to let the offenders go in some cases judges will allow aliens to be released after a bond hearing but the conditions are usually set by ice and ice attorneys say that they have been instructed not to vigorously contest an aliens request for release which brings us back to the sabillons my christian brother and my christian sister are gone and we dont enforce our immigration laws as the oath taken by those in this administration require i want to finish up by mentioning again about my being on the border i was so struck texas has utilized and provided massive amounts of money to try to help us defend our border the number one area through which people are coming into the united states moved some years back from arizona to the mcallen corridor into texas i had occasion to be on a dps boat with fantastic dps officers they had fantastic equipment that they were able to utilize to spot people who were clearly getting readybehind bushes and whatnotto cross the rio grande from the mexico side into the unitedstates it appeared clearly that some of them were just people who were going to be brought across and some were carrying things maybe they were drugs we dont really know after we had spotted these folks when we were cruising down the river on the dps boatand there were a couple of border patrol boats that were much smaller and there were other assets that allowed them to focus once we identified where these people were so that the federal border patrol would knowand after we stayed silent for a while we finally got a radio message from the border patrol that asked us to go ahead and return back to the dock way on down the river so that they could try to intercept these folks fine because i know if the department of public safety sees a raft coming across they will stop them they do destroy the raft which as i understand gets the coyote in trouble with the drug lord who sent him with the raft with people who had paid money to get them across so the dps would do that they said why dont you go ahead they are waiting for you to leave the area then we can interdict we can catch them redhanded it turns out that is exactly what they did we spent massive amounts of money and effort in spotting people before they came across the river illegally whether it was bringing drugs whether it was people coming across we knew where they were we spotted them and we directed the border patrol to them i say we it is our department of public safety people in texas we got word that is exactly what they were waiting for they came across after you left the area and now we are inprocessing them into the united states we have the power to secure our border but this administration has no will and that is why unaccompanied children are up 1 200 percent i have seen tiny little girls who couldnt have been more than 3 or 4 just in the last trip down in the days i spent down there girls like them say oh i am unaccompanied i guarantee you they did not cross that river unaccompanied they did not come 1 000 miles unaccompanied across mexico they were accompanied thank god they were not sold into sex trafficking as so many have been when we in the united states as i have been told by african friendssome of whom i have seen in the last monthsay we are the hope of the world and when we dont follow the law when we dont enforce the law when we dont enforce our own laws the world suffers as christians in africa have told me we know where we go when we die but our only hope of having a peaceful life is if america stays strong we havent done that christians are now being persecuted in greater numbers than ever in history jews are being persecuted again as if we are headed toward a new holocaust it is time for american leaders who have taken an oath to the united states constitution and to this country to realize to whom much is given from them much will be required there is going to be a day of judgment on america if we dont rise to the occasion and use what we have been blessed with i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.5999129414558411, 0.5999129414558411, 0, "i rise

gentleman i thank you for your leadership and bringing your expertise to washington it is great to serve with you and i appreciate all the leadership that you are showing not just on this issue but so many different issues that are good not just for the folks of arkansas but for the entire nation so thank you so much for being part of this special order tonight a healthy forest is so incredibly important because a healthy forest represents also wealthy communities our rural communities are so dependent on the active proper management of our national forests these national forests didnt always exist at one time our predecessorssome going back 100 years or morecame to the table with the local communities and they made a commitment that for the good of the nation they would create national forests now lets be clear national forests are not national parks they are completely different national forests are not managed by the department of the interior and the national park service national forests are managed by the department of agriculture because they were set aside and established so that our nation would always have an abundant ready supply of timber timber was one of the initial industries that we had it was so important to the past of our country but important to the future of our country as well as mr westerman really articulated well when you have a healthy forest you have carbon sinks and you have filters a lot of our watersheds originate in our national forests so it is good for clean water if they are properly managed it is good for clean air and it is good for the economy from time to time i spend some time as a lay pastor and i will fill the pulpit when i am talking to the churches i talk about how a healthy church is like a healthy forest if i go into a church and i see that everyone sitting in the pews has my hairline a little bit of salt on the side here with gray hair that is not a healthy church it is just kind of one generation well forests are the same way if you want a healthy church you need multiple generations in the pews if you want a healthy forest you need multiple generations of forest because it is good for the wildlife it is good for the birds and it is good for the mammals because they need different types of forests at different points in their maturity in order to support that wildlife one of the things that leads to putting pressure on certain species is when we stop harvesting trees we stop active management because we know that almost every species at different times in their life need that kind of open area they need time in young forest growth right through to more mature forest growth without that these species cant be supported so there are all kinds of reasons let alone the economic health of our rural communities that was a promise that was made by our predecessors when they took this land out of the private sector and put it into the public sector it was done with a promise that they would always do active management in such a way to generate the revenue to be able to backfill for those property taxes that would have been lost we have really failed at that as a nation our rural communities in and around our national forests are so challenged dont get me wrong i think we have great people that are working for the forest service i spend a lot of time with them they are dedicated professionals i think the chief of the forest service tom tidwell is an outstanding individual has strong character i like the chief because his first job in the forest service was when he was going to college and he worked summers as a firefighter i am an old firefighter he has done all the jobs he knows what it is to manage an active forest we have a lot of pressures though that the bureaucracy has placed on him we have a lot of external pressures with special interest groups who claim they are trying to save the forests but the end result of their actions where they limit they sue and they prevent forest plans from being implemented and prevent timber management from occurring they are actually killing the forests forests are living entities if they are not actively managed they will get sick and they will die when they do they become emitters of carbon when a forest is healthy it actually absorbs carbon it is a carbon sink as i said before let me talk about some of the statistics that show that much of our national forest system is unhealthy in fact the forest service has identified up to onequarter of nearly 200 million acres of national forest land as a wildfire risk we have seen a dramatic reduction of the harvest from our national forests from nearly 13 billion board feet in the 1980s to roughly 3 million board feet in past years let me put that into perspective and share some statistics on that lets go back to 1995 in 1995 onesixth of the forest service budget was used for wildfire management and mitigation it was reasonable at that point when we were using onesixth of the forest service budget we were harvesting in 1995 3 8 billion board feet lets fastforward to 2015 now the numbers i am going to share with you are from august of 2015 i readily admit i dont have the past couple months in this but at this point the forest service is spending 50 percent of its budget on fighting wildfires50 percent think about 50 percent of your household 50 percent of your familys budget your business or a local school to take 50 percent of your budget just for this type of crisis management doesnt work it just doesnt work at the same time we have only projected to harvest at that point 2 4 billion board feet it is a big part of the lack of active management we need to provide the forest service tools to be able to help them do their jobs the highwater mark was back in 1987 when we had 12 7 billion board feet harvested that is a variance from this year of 10 3 billion board feet we are constantly talking about the economic crisis that we are in here and we are we have got a debt that has been out of control i am very proud to be a part of a republicanled congress that for a number of years on the discretionary side we have actually reduced our spending and we are starting to get our arms wrapped around mandatory spending so we are doing our job but there is a need for more resources and we recognize that there is a need for more revenue we are literally burning that revenue up in our national forests each and every year dramatically how much revenue i would have to say that if you take every year 10 3 billion board feet if that is the amount that we could get our annual harvesting to you have to ask yourself how much more healthy would the forest be if the forest is healthy so many fewer wildfires would occur at just an incredible cost including the loss of lives we have lost a tremendous number of american heroes our firefighters from both the unitedstates forest service but also volunteer firefighters like myself perhaps some professional firefighters have lost their lives because of the incident it is just the crisis that we have in wildfires if we would increase our harvesting we would increase the health of the forest and we could reduce wildfires and that risk we would also increase revenue i am not prepared to tell you what the average value of a board foot in timber harvest off our national forests is i know that varies greatly i happen to represent the allegheny national forest i am proud to say that it is actually the most profitable national forest in the country it is kind of puny compared to my colleagues out west we are about 513 000 acres but we have got the worlds best hardwood cherry our hardwoods are what increase the value i know that is a wide variance on what the value of 1 board foot in 2015 of timber harvested in our national forests is but whatever that number is multiply it by 10 3 billion and that is a lot of revenue that is owned by the taxpayers of this countrygiven the fact it is their national forestthat we could be bringing in then the prosperity if we could unleash and get timber in closer to that sustainable rate what that would do for our school districts our kids our families and the jobs that would be stimulated in the forest products industry it would just have an amazing impact now as we examine these issues it becomes easier to see how everything is corrected trees which should have been harvested years ago have been allowed to become fuel for forest fires leading to the rise in the acreage burned that we have seen in recent years there are many prospective solutions to this problem including the agricultural act of 2014 also known as the farm bill i am very proud that all the members were involved with the farm bill it was a great bipartisan bill that we did it includes provisions to include improved forest management so we have taken action we have enacted into law some tools for the forest service there is just more that we need to do those tools include an expedited process in the planning for projects and the reauthorization programs such as the stewardship contracting and the good neighbor authority these all improve forest health timber sales and restoration now the house passed the resilient federal forests act of 2015 which mr westerman very appropriately talked about in july the goal of this legislation was to provide the forest service with direction and the tools to address the challenges of litigation i have to tell you we have forest plans that are about active timber management but we have these outside groups that sue the government because the government reimburses their costs even when they settle out of court that is not why the equal access to justice act was originally written not for some group that is not a direct stakeholder in terms of having property that is in the forest or adjoined to the forest but it is litigation it is funding no doubt about it it is the process it is basic timber harvesting and essential active management i will come back to some of those in just a bit i want to share some outcomes from the most recent hearing that we had with the conservation and forestry subcommittee i am proud to cosponsor this important piece of legislation i believe that it should become law it will have a major impact on reducing catastrophic wildfires across the nation the district that i represent pennsylvanias fifth congressional district is the home of the allegheny national forest the only national forest in the commonwealth it encompasses more than 513 000 acres across four counties and for generations it has formed the economic bedrock of small communities in that region in some ways the allegheny is very different from our western forestsi have mentioned some of thosebut it has many similar challenges including a lack of timbering reduced county budgets and outbreaks of invasive species reforming the way we deal with wildfires and forestry management will have a positive effect in forests and in rural communities not just in the allegheny national forest in pennsylvania but quite frankly across the nation i look forward to hearing more from my colleagues and taking opportunities in the future to host more of these special orders in looking at ways so that we can confront the very real challenges in national forest regions i wanted to share some of the outcomes from our most recent hearing that we had on this issue back on october 8 we had some great speakers come in witnesses that provided testimony from all over the country i will just share with you some of the things that would be helpful things that we need to consider i am going to start in the category of increasing the efficiency and the effectiveness of forest management that we have starting with giving an opportunity for state primacy this was an idea that came out from a rancher in washington state the states tend to have less bureaucracy they have less of a target on their back by these outside groups that are suing so the states success at increasing active timber management and a higher level of forest health but state primacy is something that was an idea that came out that needs to at least have further consideration expanding what we call categorical exemption from nepa analysis that doesnt mean that we are not looking at the environmental impacts that couldnt be further from the truth for where it makes sense what we need to do is provide a categorical exemption from a fullblown nepa analysis but we need to do that more on a landscape perspective so a landscape management we are talking large scale 100 000 acres or more being able to more efficiently being able to more effectively manage the forest we have provided some categorical exemption opportunities within the farm bill to the forest service for regular maintenance activities where they had to spend a tremendous amount of resources just to clear a power line or to do trail maintenance or replant after a forest fire wildfire quite frankly their sister agencies the bureau of land management and the corps of engineers they didnt have to do that so this is just kind of common sense we need to protect our active management funds we cant be dipping into the funds that we use to manage the forest that is what happened that is what i referred to as that large sucking sound it is not just resources my forest supervisor who does a great job she was detailed she went out west for a period of time she wasnt on our forest doing her job because of the need for her expertise in the west during one of those wildfires this past year in the west we need to protect our active management funds there are some things that came out a recommendation for larger air tankers to be able to deal with the size and the scale of the wildfires that are out there we need to obviously reduce this litigation out of 311 projects this past year 16 wound up in the courts that is a significant number quite frankly it is not necessary unfortunately it has become a fundraising scheme for the most part it is not contributing towards forest health it actually is deteriorating our forest health we have an increase in invasive species we are burning up our forest at a record level when you burn forest you ruin that water filter you impact water quality you impact as a carbon sink so we need to reduce the litigation and take steps to be able to do that we do need personnel there is no doubt about it we have 49 percent fewer foresters than just in 2010 it is our professional foresters the silviculturists who are outof knowing how to mark the timber of knowing when to harvest the timber when it is at peak value that is an asset owned by the american people we shouldnt be waiting until that tree blows over burns down or is eaten by some type of bug invasive specie until we harvest it we should harvest it really at its peak value that is demonstrating a fiduciary responsibility for the american people with this asset and then certainly we need more collaborative work again h r 2647 would achieve that so that is more efficient more effective forest management let me look briefly at response we do need to fund this appropriately i am a supporter of a concept that would look at larger fires more widespread i dont know how we gauge thatby acreage or dollar value lost or dollars needed those really are natural disasters they are as every bit a natural disaster as an earthquake a hurricane or a tornado those larger fires should be dealt with as natural disasters and then other fires on a smaller scale underneath whatever that threshold is set then lets do that through regular order with the forest service budget with what we appropriate there is a definite difference that would be a recommendation that was something that came out of a discussion and then safe harbor for mutual aid one rancher from washington talked about a forest service where there was ai dont know if it was a state or a private individual with a bulldozera cat came up to the forest service line two situations one time they asked the forest service person who was working under the direction of somebody in the bureaucracy they welcomed him in and they saved a tremendous spread of that fire and then another time where the forest service personnel said no we have to fill out the permits first well you have got the wildlife burning but we have got to fill out the permits and we have got to do the paperwork i am not judging that forest service employee because they were probably doing whatever they were told to do and there was more catastrophic loss there so some type of safe harbor that allows better use of mutual aid i want to yield to a friend of mine because it kind of speaks to the efficiency and the effectiveness on the equal access to justice act this is the law that we kind of talked about that really has encouraged radical environmental groups to file lawsuits and stop forest plans from occurring i yield to the gentleman from georgia to speak on the topic"], [0.5982435345649719, 0.5982435345649719, 0, "house resolution 287 provides for a modified open rule for separate consideration of h r 2578 and h r 2577 under this rule any member may offer any amendments to the bills in question that comply with the rules of the house it also provides for 10 minutes of debate on each amendment considered this approach has been what we call a standard rule for appropriations bills and was established and has been followed for this last year and the year before and i believe it has been effective and really a good way for this body to be able to effectively operate allowing each and every member of this body the chance to offer their amendments this rule also accomplishes two important goals first it reflects the majoritys commitment to an open and transparent appropriations process this rule will also allow for all members to bring to this body their ideas that they have that they bring from back home perhaps ideas from their own individual constituents about how we can make this appropriations process even better i think it is important that members of congress be given an opportunity to do this in the appropriations process and that is exactly what we are trying to do today for a robust opportunity for discussion if an amendment complies with the rules of the house it certainly will be given an upordown vote if that member chooses to do so secondly this rule provides for reasonable time constraints it is my belief that if members ideas are heard and the process by which we consider appropriations bills is done on a timely basis then the house will benefit and so will the american people so that we work effectively and efficiently at the same time this rule i believe strikes a good balance allowing all members an opportunity to offer necessary amendments but also allowing the house to get its work done i estimate that we will spend about 18 hours in the process to get these bills done throughout this open process the house will be able to make two great bills i think even better the open process by which these two bills will be considered if the rule is adopted is not only a good thing but i think it says something about the work that the rules committee is doing i am proud to support these two underlying bills because they make tough decisions and they prioritize the responsibilities of the federal government we simply do not have enough money to spread around to not have to make tough decisions these are tough decisions that are made yesterday at the rules committee both of these bills were equally addressed on a bipartisan basis and both the ranking member and the chairman of the subcommittee said they worked well together obviously not everybody was happy with how much money they had to spend but both of the ranking membersthe democrats who were presentaddressed our committee and said that they were treated fairly that they were treated respectfully and that it was an open and transparent process to achieve good things for the bills that is the hope that i have as we come to the floor today in that you will see groups of members who will come to the floor with an open opportunity as a result of what we did in the rules committee knowing that the process that took place back in the appropriations committee was well done alarmingly however yesterday we learned that president obama has threatened to veto both of these bills because as i quote him they drastically underfund critical investments let me see if i can break this down for you it is our job to determine what those appropriations levels would be we heard from the president of the united states when he presented his budget and year after year after year the president of the united states has failed to receive more than only several votes on his budget i believe that what we have done by working carefully and meticulously through the budget process and through the appropriations process gives us a better angle on the needs and the priorities of these agencies from a congressional and i believe a back home experience the people of this country elected their representatives and their representatives have come to washington and have had a fair and open process notwithstanding that we are not spending as much as people want us to spend i believe that the president is saying that he will veto these bills because he does not believe that we simply continue to spend more and more and more this president has an insatiable appetite that we saw and have seen year after year after year based upon his words i would say back to him mr president please look at the merits of the work that the house of representatives is doing on a bipartisan basis we are trying to live within the parameters of a budget that has been established and that was voted on by members of this body that has the vast majority of the members of this body to say when compared to the presidents budget this is the budget that i believe best represents not only what we can accomplish but what will work in the best interests of the american people our constituents mr president they are the same ones that you have across this great nation mr president we are asking you to take a second look at how you will listen to us and to watch the process that is going on here i think it will develop itself into a better way for us to do business and i would encourage the white house to look at that a great nation simply cannot spend money that it does not have and be a great nation for very long this last month we crossed over the terrible terrible threshold of going from 17 trillion to 18 trillion in debt and we continue to add up this debt and live off that debt and add to the debt with the spending that we do we believe that what we have got to do is become more responsible with the taxpayers dollars and the future of this great nation the law of the land and the law that the president has signed requires congress to act within the requirements of the budget control act these were agreements that were made with the president that is what we are sticking to and that is what these bills do yet the president once again is telling us please set aside the agreement that was made i dont now like the thing that i agreed to that i signed into law in some instances they were some of the presidents own ideas we need to understand that the american people want and expect us to see problems and to solve them and to stick to it that is what this budget process is about and that is exactly what this appropriations process is about look i disagree with the president i believe that what we need to do is to live within the agreement of the budget control act my party the republicans have worked to lower discretionary spending from nearly 1 5 trillion in 2009 where we were to today in 2015 1 014 trillion that is the difference between 2009 and 2015 years in which excessive and outofcontrol spending could have taken place but for the discipline of the republican party and the discipline of our members and might i say of the american people who have heard our call for having a plan a plan which carefully moves america into the future that lessens the amount of debt the american people have to take on and that makes better opportunities for our children and grandchildren not to have to pay back our excessive spending just because we are a group of people who thinks it is smarter than the people back home we arent they get also that we have to have a defined goal we have to do exactly what they do back home and that is to be responsible about a family budget about a state budget about a federal government budget that means disciplined accountability and a plan that you are willing to stick to that is exactly what we have done we have worked hard to lower discretionary spending over these years and the effort has saved more than 2 trillion over this period of time and i believe over what would have been spent i think this is a big win for the american people and i think it is a big win for people who want need and expect members of congress to come to washington and stick not only to a plan but to a disciplined approach in trying to balance together the needs of this great nation and its people and the need for us to look over the horizon at what our future would be i think that we have lowered spending and that we have had a chance to shrink the size of government certainly what we are trying to do is to work at lowering the deficit or the amount of money that would have been added to that deficit these are the discussions that people back home have with their members of congress what lies ahead and how are you going to be able to make tough decisions i hope that the president of the united states is listening to this because we are on a bipartisan basis having these same discussions in the house of representatives and in the committees on which our members serve now is the time not to go back to liberal reckless spending opportunities they will always abound it is always easier to spend somebody elses money i just dont think it is right so the republican party is here on the floor today with two more appropriations bills and it is going to sell to the american people the confidence that we have that we can make this government work more effectively and more efficientlyyes with fewer dollars but with greater opportunities for efficiency i believe that both of these bills strike what is a balance a balance between funding critical projects while making smart financial decisions these two can be accomplished and that is why we are trying to work together to prioritize it h r 2578 the commerce justice science and related agencies appropriations act of 2016 focuses on the true governmental interest fighting crime making decisions about how we keep terrorists at bay keeping the american people safe and supporting the unitedstates economy at the same time by making critical investments in science space exports and manufacturing certainly in tough economic times tough decisions are required and that is exactly where we are yesterday we had a chance to hear from two members of congressrepublicansone of them the gentleman from houston texas the subcommittee chairman he talked about the bill reflecting smart but fair decisions the decisions that he spoke about were that the legislation provided 51 4 billion in total discretionary which was 661 million below the presidents request h r 2578 also prioritizes vital programs that are essentially built around law enforcementfederal law enforcementand their ability to aim at the problems that our citizens see and that certainly our law enforcement sees and to put a priority on national security and public safety and initiatives that also aim for job creation and economic growth these are part of the priorities that have to be taken up and in fact they were the second bill h r 2577 the transportation housing and urban development and related agencies appropriations act of 2016 i believe similarly had many of the same characteristics first of all they are going to stick to exactly what we talked about in the budget and they are going to have to strike a balancea tough balancebut one which is based on the priorities of essential programs and on making responsible reductions to lowpriority activities this bill provides 55 3 billion in discretionary funding which is 9 7 billion below what the president wanted once again the president does not want to stick to the budget agreementan agreement which he signed into lawbut that is what this body is going to do we are going to live within the law and living within the law is what the american people expect as part of the plan this bill allows for important investments in national transportation infrastructure including investments in our national highways railways and airports it also provides help to people who are in dire need of affordable housing options i learned a long time ago when i became a scoutmaster for the boy scouts of america that needs always outpace resources needs are always out there and they are something that you just simply want to continue to be a part of but money is not always the answer sometimes a prioritization of the needs that you have to meet will then define you to a better process one which people can then better understand that is what we are doing here today like most members who will have an opportunity as a result of the work that we did last night in the rules committee i have ideas that i think can help improve h r 2577 one of those ideas i have brought to the floor many many times in a bill and during the debate on funding i think i will have good ideas that will help make our country strongerin this case make transportation stronger it became clear to me a number of years ago that government subsidized rail service on amtrak does not make economic sense what we have looked at is that amtrak takes money years and years and years ago they agreed that they would quit taking government subsidies and would run the railroad as an east and west operation instead what did they do they became a crosscountry hauler every single longdistance route that amtrak providesthose of more than 400 miles in lengthoperate at a loss every single month there are 11 routes that cost double the amount of revenue that they create that is why i have offered two important opportunities which were amendments to eliminate this the first would eliminate the funding for amtraks longdistance routes which have a total direct cost of more than twice the revenue that means if the cost is twice the revenue then it would be eliminated the second would eliminate the funding for amtraks worst performing line the sunset limited the sunset limited which is an eastwest and westeast operation is subsidized for every single ticket and for every single train by over 400 in government subsidies a loss totalling 41 9 million last year alone these are just some of the ideas you will be hearing about lots of them over the next 18some hours of debate that will take place this is a good thing about this rule members just like myself will have a chance to come and put their ideas as opportunities on the floor for other members to consider i think that is why we are here today to work together on a process that will make our country even stronger i reserve the balance of my time"]], "top_unsure": [[2.384185791015625e-07, 0.5000002384185791, 0, "i thank the

district is the source of much of californias water and home to its largest reservoirs just two of which can hold 8 million acrefeet enough for 32 million people for an entire year this water is delivered throughout the length of the state and no other district provides so much for so many however even my constituents are facing mandatory rationing and fallowed fields i support this measure because it respects state water rights and aids all californians without favoring any region of the state over another ask the bay area lawmakers who have expressed so much concern over sparking a water war where their water comes from you will find that their water comes from my district my colleagues districts in the valley as well as the sierras this bill advances planning of five surface water storage projects that would yield enough water for 9 6 million people projects that twothirds of californians voted to fund with state money just last year yet my disappointment here is that we have so many california legislators today and in the past that oppose anything we try to do to enhance the water supply and deliverability in the state of california what is more it isnt human water use that is negatively impacting listed species according to the national marine fisheries service and delta stewardship council 90 percent of endangered winterrun salmon are killed and eaten by invasive fish species before they even reach the delta the opposition despite all data to the contrary denies that invasive species are a part of the problem years of lawsuits aimed at reducing water use havent helped at all endangered salmon but this bill takes real steps to aid that population this bill takes action to reduce the populations of invasive species while opponents may claim this bill impacts commercial salmon fishing they wont say that the national marine fisheries service found that commercial ocean fishing reduces the remaining endangered winterrun chinook population by as much as 25 percent so there it is right there 92 5 percent of endangered winterrun chinook are killed by invasive species and commercial fishing outside of whatever happens in the delta 92 5 percent when opponents claim that this bill alters the endangered species act ask them to show you the language where it does so they cant show you that because it doesnt exist believe me if i could i would

longer be enrolled in employmentbased coverage and of those 500 000 will have no insurance so that statement is not correct and if i might say so when the chairman said the house will take up a bill

the tpp i have been down to the confidential room it is a very thick document and there are two bound volumes and there is a binder that goes with it as sort of a guide what struck me the most about

are not allowed to take notes from the room and this document references other bound documents so how could i possiblyone person by myself in a confidential roomunderstand what some of the unintended consequences of this trade agreement would be if i cant understand the document and if i am not allowed the resources to fully analyze this document i want there to be more daylight on this document before we put it on a path to approval the other reason i voted no today was the implication of ceding our authority to the world trade organization which struck me this week when we voted to overturn our country of origin labeling on beef and pork now whether you think we should require companies to label beef and pork when they bring them into this country from another countrywhether that is a good thing or whether that is a bad thingthat doesnt matter what disturbs me is that the reason for writing this law this week was the world trade organization told us we had to they said we have got to do that we swore an oath to the constitution not to the world trade organization my concern is that this trade agreement could bind us to things that we dont even understand yet because surely some trade agreement years ago has caused us this week to change our food labeling laws the third and final reason i voted against the tpa todayand this may be the best reason in factis that my
