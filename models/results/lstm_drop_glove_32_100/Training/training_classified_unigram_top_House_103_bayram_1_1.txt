does not vail out the shareholders officers or directors of failed savings and loans when an institution falls the shareholders are wiped out and the rtc gives them nothing officers and directors also receive nothing when the institution is closed the only people bailed out in the savings and loan riale are the insured depositors who relied on the unitedstates depositguar ntee i recognize that voting for this bill is not politically easy however there are no alternatives without such funding the unitedstates government would be forced to renege on its deposit insurance guarantee which would have disastrous economic and political consequences this is not a partisan rule while it precludes amendments proposed by republicans it also precludes amendments proposed by democrats frankly most of those were amendmenits that have been soundly defeated in the past and they were proposed by merahers who had no intention of voting for final passage even if their amendmnts were adopted this is a fair rule it provides debate on a bipartisan leadership amendment which incorporates many republican posit4ions and addresses manr republican as well as democratic concerns both parties were actively involved in the drafting of this amendment and were a le to reach a satisfactory ompromise specifically the amendment addresses republican concerns with landing for the saif the budget implications of

and the economy there is no single issue which evokes more passion or concern among the american people as crime at the community level it is time to increase the involvement of those who serve daily on the frontlines fighting this national crime epidemic it has been proven that serious crime decreases when law enforcement officials are visible members of the communities in which they serve thus community based policing is one highly effective measure which can combat the daily atrocities which occur in so many american towns and cities across this nation this will not solve the problem of

to the community the hope is that in doing so we can prevent them from commiting crime again antigang programs and substance abuse programs for both state and federal prisoners will also greatly assist law enforcement by trying to break the cycle of crime i support all of your bills today and commend you for an excellent job in bringing them to the floor before we recess this year in addition

the republican plan is detailed and specific and best of all it reduces the deficit by 429 billion over 5 years without raising taxes without touching social security without slashing defense and without crippling the economy the republican plan is a plain comrnmonsense approach of cutting spending by eliminating outdated programs and reforming or reducing many others the republican proposal reforms medicaid public housing foreign aid programs the madical malpractice system and child nutrition programs the plan also reduces funding for the corporation for public broadcasting the arts and

federal budget deficit in the case of the spending on additional government programs kasich amendment the substitute budget offinally after conclusion of debate on the fared by the republican members of the budget resolution the house will take up the budget committee i support the goal of restimulus package i believe we should not ducing the deficit strictly through cutting spend the 16 3 billion on the shortterm eco spending without rasin revenues nomic stimulus package this spending is for far too long every revenue increase aplargely in the form of govermment makework proved by congress with the intent of reducing jobs that in the short run will drive up the defl the budget deficit has actually increased fed cit and in the long run will not create lasting eral spending and consequently added to the jobs we would be better off to reduce the deficit this taxandspend philosophy is what federal deficit by an additional 16 3 billion helped drive our nation into debt and for the president is suppose to be looking for which we are now paying almost 300 billion ways to reduce the defictastimated to be per year in interest on the accumulated na 327 billion and instead has found a way to tional debl this interest payment has acadd over 16 billion in new deficit spending counted for more than 75 percent of the insuch spending is unnecessary and expensive crease n our naional debt over the past 12 and will result in very few jobs there are years roughly 13 programs in this bill that do not in comparing the budget resolution reported create any jobs and there are another 16 pro by the committee to the kasich amendment grams thet create jobs at a cost of 200 000 there are a number of glaring differences the or more per job obviously jobs are not the committee recommends 316 billion in tax inmain purpose of this spending program the creases over the next 5 years which the conomb director leon panetta claims the bill gresslonal budget office estimates wiln cost will create 219 000 jobs at 16 3 billion in families with aftertax incomes of 34 000 an total spending each new job will cost 89 041 additional 500 a year more in federal taxes per job as the republican members of the the kasich amendment calls for no new inappropriation committee pointed out the pd come gasoline or energy taxes and it does not accept the recommendation by president clinton to increase the tax rate on social security benefits through spending reductions alone the kasich amendment would reduce the 1994 budget deficit by 38 billionmore than twice the reduction recommended by president clintonand would provide for 430 billion in deficit reduction over the next 5 years 70 billion more than the proposal by president clinton the two budget resolutions also differ greatly on how to reduce federal spending the package recommended by president clinton calls for 156 billion in nondefense budget cuts versus 370 billion in nondefense budget cuts in the kasich budget over the next 5 years president clinton recommends 112 billion in defense cuts over the same time period double the amount recommended in the more responsible kasich budget the budget alternatives before us also take extremely different approaches to reducing unitedstates foreign aid payments with the kasich amendment recommending 13 billion in cuts over the next 5 years versus the 7 billion recommended by president clinton specifically i strongly support two major cuts in foreign aid included in the kasich amendment the first would save 1 billion over 5 years by withholding any future unitedstates contributions to the world bank and other multilateral development banks which as i have called attention to for many years have a history of making questionable and unsound loans to foreign nationsoften times our adversaries which will never be repaid the second recommendation is that the united states also withhold any future contributions to the international development association or ida over the next 5 years resulting in savings of more than 5 5 billion ida is the world bank affiliate which makes lowinterestloans to the poorest of nations many which have the worlds worst domestic policies and human rights records domestically the kasich amendment recommends that the federal government set an example for reducing spending by saving 100 billion over the next 5 years through reduced federal bureaucracy and overhead expenses it would reduce federal employment by 162 000 civilian positions over the next 5 years 50 000 more than recommended by president clinton it also reduces the budget for the operations of the legislative branch by more than 15 percent a figure which i believe could be increased to 25 percent or more finally the kasich amendment has less of an impact on older americans than president clintons proposal the kasich amendment recommends no increased taxes on social security benefits as included in the presidents plan it also does not increase medicare part b premiums for all older americans as recommended by the chairman of the budget committee instead it would initiate a meanstesting program for medicare which would raise medicare premiums and deductibles for older americans with incomes over 100 000 in the past i have opposed meanstesting of the medicare program and i believe that this recommendation should be the focus of lengthy congressional hearings before it is brought before the house in any legislation to implement the recommendations approved today the american people have spoken out and demanded that congress work to ensure that the federal government learns to live within its means many of the people from pinellas county i represent have applauded president clinton for putting forth a plan to reduce the budget deficit but even more have said that although this is a good first step congress should go further in reducing spending the kasich amendment does just that by significanty reducing spending without raising taxes following consideration of the kasich amendment we will consider a second proposal which provides for even greater deficit reduction the so called solomon amendment takes the kasich budget cuts and reduces spending over the next 5 years by another 38 billion the solomon amendment provides for no increase in taxes on the middleclass families no energy taxes and no increase in the taxes paid on social security benefits it does provide for a surtax on quartermillionaires a new 36percent tax rate for joint filers with incomes over 200 000 and it eliminates the deductiblity of compensation over 1 million for business executives athletes and entertainers this new revenue is used to pay for the extension of some very important tax incentives that help spur business investment and job creation these include the permanent extension of the research and development tax credit the targeted jobs tax credit and the restoration of the deductibility of losses from passive real estate provisions the solomon amendment also provides for a capital gains tax deduction for startup companies and repels the luxury tax on boatsa tax which has shut down many of our states and our nations few remaining boat builders finally the solomon amendment would require the committees with appropriate jurisdiction to report to the house later this year legislation to provide the president with lineitem veto authority over appropriations and authorizing bills and a constitutional amendment providing for a balanced budget amendment while i support the kasich amendment should it fail i will support the solomon amendment although it includes revenue increases there are half as many as recommended by president clinton and there are 38 billion more in spending cuts than the committee bill over the next 5 years and as i said before while i do not agree with every provision of the solomon amendment such as the significant cut in space station funding and the consolidation of our nations intelligence gathering operations i believe it senes its purpose in providing a framework for debate which relies much more on spending cuts than the presidents budget in closing i want to express my serious concerns about the procedure under which we consider these budget resolutions today we are being asked to vote on a budget resolution which is based upon a package which president clinton will not formally submit to congress for another 21 weeks we are also being asked to vote on a budget resolution today which if implemented would require significant sacrifices by the american people to reduce the federal budget deficit yet later this evening we will be asked to consider without the benefit of amendment a supplemental appropriations bill that will add 30 billion to the budget deficit for the current year in the 6 months we have until the new fiscal year begins we must dedicate ourselves to making the tough decisions required to reduce spending and get our fiscal house in order gimmicks and rhetoric will not do the job it will require long hours of genuine debate and a soes of difficult votes to enable our nation to reestablish its budgetary

we build a defense budget ke that allows us to have enough planes h enough people enough aircraft cared riers and enough equipment and personnel to meet that threat whether it g is a desert storm operation that we ir think we are going to need or defending st the korean peninsula against the e north korean attack a contingency n there or maybe having the capability i of making a panamatype contingency n operation we basically build to the ir threat s president clinton did something a is little different this year he took the n 50 billion cuts that george bush had made after the berlin wall had fallen le and he just arbitrarily came up with o 127 billion additional that is 127 bille lion in additional defense cuts it as senator sam nunn the chairman g of the senate armed services said re this number was pulled out of thin p air that means that the fact that the n north koreans are building a nuclear ld weapon we know that now we know e they have withdrawn from the nuclear i nonproliferation treaty the fact that n byelorussia and the ukraine and kazakhstan and russia all have nue clear weapons now those are the four d states that made up the former soviet ln union they all have nuclear weapons to now e h2927 we know there is instability in those nations there is a dispute as to now who has the pink slip on nuclear weapons some of them top end nuclear weapons we know our adversaries in the middle east are acquiring nuclear capability and the missile technology with which to deliver those weapons we know also that red china is claiming all the territory that is available in the south china sea they are moving in warships they are moving in aircraft landing areas building air bases for warplanes we know all these dangers are arising around the world and all of these dangers incidentally are since and in addition to those dangers that we had in the cold war era and yet in the face of those dangers we are cutting 127 billion out of defense so this new socalled new democrat plan that came from the socalled new democrat president clinton is not new at all it is the same old thing it is the same pattern that was utilized by jimmy carter the same pattern that was espoused by george mcgovern and many other liberal democrats and that is raise taxes and match those increases in taxes with spending cuts not in social programs because in social programs the clinton plan actually increases social spending but in fact cut only defense spending even though you have not evaluated the world situation and even though it could be very dangerous i thank my friends for yielding because i think it is an important point to make that before he became secretary of defense les aspin who was the chairman of the house armed services committee on which i sat made an analysis in this analysis he said what will we need in terms of planes and tanks and personnel and aircraft carriers and all of those other parts of national defense what will we need to handle three contingencies none of which involve the soviet union those three contingencies were a desert stormtype operation like we had in the persian gulf defense of the korean peninsula and lastly a panama canaltype contingency and he came up with the dollars we needed to do that he thought that was an important thing and bill clinton cut that level by 60 billion so the facts are that this package which is put together guts national defense throws 2 million defense workers out of work and has done all of this with no backdrop of national security against which to analyze and define exactly what we needed and i thank the gentleman for yielding me time to come over and talk just a little bit about national security and the fact that the clinton plan that we are going to be voting on that we have already voted on in part guts national defense and those are where the big cuts are to go with these big tax increases that are levied on the american people and i thank the gentleman

said that the nunn skelton language can work each strongly endorsed what we have done in this bill if my colleagues care about the people in the military they will support the skelton amendment which is the nunn skelton language i rise today to say clearly that enough is enough the issue of homosexuals in the military has been far too divisive has consumed far too much of the nations energy and has robbed this body of far too much of our legislative agenda we must put this issue behind us we must do so immediately it is my hope that we will do so today i am happy to announce that a solution to the problem is available there is a provision in the bill that codifies a workable policy and my amendment codifies a workable policy but does so in a manner that protects the combat capability of the armed forces it is supported by the president the secretary of defense and general powell and the other joint chiefs of staff perhaps most importantly the language in this provision is identical to that adopted by the committee on armed services of the other body by a vote of 17 to 5 with all the committee republicans voting to adopt your vote to turn back amendments to the language that currently resides in the bill will keep it identical to the language in the other body and will put the issue to rest in conference it will not be a conference item rather it will be a law that the attorney general the general counsel of the department of defense and a panel of constitutional lawyers agree can withstand the challenges in the courts in short it is a solution that will stand the test of time a solution that cannot be altered without coming to the elected representatives of the american people to us members of congress of the united states what does this provision do in the skelton amendment the provision would set out the fundamental difference between military and civilian life and makes clear the importance of preserving high standards of morale good order and discipline and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability it does this with 15 congressional findings that reflect the results of our hearings here in the armed services committee as well as in the other body the provision would require the department of defense to issue regulations within 90 days which direct separation if the member has engaged in attempted to engage in or solicited another to engage in a homosexual act states that he or she is a homosexual br bisexual or words to that effect married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the same biological sex the provision would require the secretary of defense to establish enlistment and appointment policies that are consistent with the policy and to conduct briefings upon entry and periodically thereafter upon reenlistment that address sexual conduct of members of the armed forces to include the policies prescribed in especially in this bill the provision would include the sense of congress that the secretary of defense should reinstate the procedure for asking applicants for enlistment and candidates for appointment about their sexual orientation if at some time in the future the secretary of defense considers it necessary based on the testimony of the secretary of defense the joint chiefs the general counsel of the department of defense and the services senior enlisted members during recent hearings before the subcommittee on military forces and personnel which i chair i am convinced that the heart of the prejanuary 1993 policy has been preserved in the nunn skelton language the result is a policy that will change very little of the daytoday life of service members it is clear to me that the bottom line remains the same as it always has been homosexuals will be separated if they demonstrate conduct that is disruptive to morale and unit cohesion the language in the bill would place that heart of the policy permanently in the law as i have stated before i have long been committed to codifying the solution to the debate by codifying we mean putting it into the law the statute books of this country in my view codification is an essential step if we hope to put this divisive issue behind us if we decline to codify the policy we will substantially erode the ability of the department of justice to defend the policy against challenge in the courts and we will have effectively invited litigation from people who perceive that the policy lacks the committed support of the congress i have elected to support the men and women of the armed forces on this issue and i believe the language in the bill does exactly that the polls i have seen would indicate that servicemembere are overwhelmingly in favor of continuing the ban on homosexuals conduct in the military two different surveys indicated that over 75 percent of the men and women in the military believe the ban that existed prior to january 1993 should be continued in one of those surveys a remarkable 45 percent indicated that they would leave the military if the ban was lifted such a hemorrhage of trained and educated talent is simply a risk to our defense capability that i am unwilling to assume in addition to the views of the troops there are two other surveys that reveal that retired flag officers oppose the service of homosexuals at an alarming 90 percent plus rate i recently received a letter from retired gen maxwell r thurman a figure well known to this body as an extraordinary leader and the general who led our forces to victory in panama he is a man i greatly respect his view echoes the testimony of the joint chiefs and other distinguished retired officers to include gen norman schwarzkopf and lt gen calvin waller general thurman says my own view is that overt homosexuality in the armed forces if permitted will be devastating to unit morale cohesion and ultimately unit effectiveness in combat those are the words of general thurman i like these other highly respected leaders am very cautious about any change that potentially threatens the morale and cohesion of our fighting force we must not risk fundamentally undermining the best military force in our nations history second place does not count on the battlefield for me personally the presidents initiative has been a disturbing issue my family background is deeply rooted in traditional religious values and many of my constituents have sent a clear signal that they believe the service of open homosexuals is wrong accordingly we must not forget that this policy focuses on the issues of greatest concern to service members and carries forward key elements of the former policy that protects those interests i feel we have achieved our objective of a policy that protects the combat capability of our military forces and the welfare of our men and women in uniform while allowing the services to stop asking the question of recruits and to exercise greater control in curbing wasteful inquisition

has provided ample funds in the esf and fmv accounts to fully meet our camp david commitments to israel and egypt and has made it very clear in this bill that it expects the administration to disperse these funds as it has in the past israel is the united states most important ally in the middle east more importantly it is a haven for refugees from the former soviet union and ethiopia where they have been persecuted both officially and unofficially for hundreds of years the funding that the united states provides to israel helps it maintain its qualitative military edge in a region where all but one of its neighbors refuse to recognize its right to exist it also assists the israelis in assimilating the huge number of new arrivals and provide decent housing and economic opportunity for them i am very pleased that the foreign operations subcommittee has included these funds and that the foreign affairs committee showed clear support for israel by earmarking them this bill also makes a strong statement about the importance of strengthening bilateral and multilateral voluntary family planning programs h r 2295 contains 392 million for the aid population program and 50 million for the united nations population fund rapid population growth is one of the most pressing problems facing the world poverty environmental degradation malnutrition and infant and child mortality caused by improperly spaced births are all direct results of the lack of adequate global access to voluntary family planning services in addition as prof paul kennedy clearly lays out in his latest book rapid population growth that is not accompanied by economic growth is a politically destabilizing force the highest growth rates in the world today are in the arab states of the middle east world population is presently increasing by 1 billion people every 11 years the human misery and irreversible environmental problems caused by population growth will only increase without action this bill addresses this urgent need and makes substantial increases in funding for population programs the bill also forcefully addresses the pressing problem of global environmental degradation with a central focus on promoting sustainable development as the report to accompany the bill makes clear economic growth must be predicated on sustainable use of resources rather than their exploitation funding is provided

actually bring down federal spending than any other effort made to date including the grammrudmanhollings act and the 1990 budget agreement the budget committee did not go as far in cutting spending

favor of the budget resolution even though in my opinion it did not contain adequate spending reductons now it is suggested that a deal is a deal and that supporting the additional spending cuts in the penny kaslch rescission bill might violate the compromise reached in the budget committee this suggestion has caused me great distress and significant contemplation because my most prized possession is my honor upon reflection i do not believe that supporting this bill is in any way a breach of my agreement to support the budget compromise reached in the committee in fact i voted in favor of the budget resolution in the committee and on the floor of the house last spring i could not vote in favor of the budget reconciliation bill passed by the house in august because of my

not enough we must weigh budget priorities against the revenue raised in taxes and make real spending cuts in fact establishing the right spending priorities is a driving principle behind many of the

rule and the conference report on the crime bill it is clear that most americans want the congress and government at every level to make fighting crime our number one public priority once again however a debate on crime has been overshadowed by a sideshow produced and directed by the national rifle association it is time that house members recognize that the nra leadership has no interest in combatingcrime instead it is preoccupied with collecting dues and contributions any scare tactic is acceptable as long as it fills nra coffers to listen to the nras shopworn arguments twisted constitutional interpretations and bullying threats one would never know that this bill contains only a modest provision to ban a few weapons that have virtually no sporting purposes and that few lawabiding citizens own no ones constitutional rights are threatened by this bill but the nra must raise that specter in order to rouse its current members to send more cash and induce new members to join make no mistake about my motives i have been a hunter i collect guns i keep a loaded gun in my home for protection i am a gun man but i do not need an assault rifleand i do not believe that passage of this bill will lead to the long arm of the federal government confiscating all guns this is a reasonably good bill and it deserves our support i have found that the nra members in the district i represent are way ahead of the nra leadership in washington rankandfile nra members tell me that they will fight hard to protect their right to own and use firearms for legitimate purposes but that they have no objection to reasonable efforts to keep weapons from those who would misuse them contrary to nra pr6paganda this is not a gun control bill it is an anticrime bill that includes the assault weapon ban as one part one relatively small partof an overall strategy this bill provides tougher sentences more law enforcement more prison cells and more crime prevention that is what the american people want it is easy to pick apart this or any legislation i would have written it differently we all would have written it differently but this bill is a step in the right direction this bill will not eliminate crime it cannot but it will prevent crimes that now occur it will take more criminals off the street for a longer time and most important it will save american lives letus

todays thirty years ago it made sense to offer incentives to attract businesses to the parks however it is now 1994 and park visitation rates exceed a quarter of a billion people per year in addition federal investments in roads and other programs in the past 30 years have made parks even more accessible and they are now have attractive business opportunities so in my estimation and in my experience with our national park system in hawaii where we have visitors from all over the world let alone the united states and hawaii itself s 208 makes a series of very prudent reforms it eliminates the concessioners preferential right to renew contracts if they have gross annual revenues in excess of 500 000 and it reforms the method of calculating the concessioners possessory interest in order for a more accurate value to be assessed i believe that this will protect the liability to the taxpayer this measure will return the revenues generated by concessionaires to the

well as of course the national park service it does recognize andi want to note for the record the area in which i have some knowledge and i think it should be something that should go on the record i want it noted from the act that there are established federal contracting authorities aside from the 1965 act that this bill would repeal and replace that the national park service can use in conjunction with the authority provided by the bill as reported for example the randolphsheppard act allows a federal agency to solesource a concession contract or authorize to a state which in turn assigns it to a blind operator the committee understands that this authority has been successfully utilized at the unitedstatess arizona memorial a particular area which is visited by literally millions of people at pearl harbor hawaii repeal of the 1965 act will not affect such other contracting authorities and the committee expects that the national park service will continue to utilize

donate tissue must be made after the decision to have an abortion it also adds another protection to ensure that only tissue that has been obtained under applicable state law may be used in research fetal tissue research has already led to a number of medical advances and is very promising in fighting diseases ranging from alzheimers and parkinsons disease to juvenile diabetes and leukemia the bliley amendment would add a number of unnecessary and burdensome regulations to the bill further impeding this critical research that has already been delayed for the past 6 years in addition it would ban the use of tissue from abortions that may have been paid for with federal funds while the federal funding of abortions is currently prohibited by the hyde amendment it has never been made a part of permanent authorizing language and would add still another obstacle to the future funding of abortions for poor women who receive their health care from the federal government the bliley amendment is opposed by a broad coalition of scientific and health organizations including the american medical association the american academy of pediatrics and the american college of physicians to

that i do not resort to hysteria the gentleman just explained that the example of the irs agent is a violation of law now if he did it and would be a violation of law under this bill and there is no evidence whatsoever that the bill that was defeated last week by 3 votes 275 to 142 275 voting for the bill on a suspension there is no evidence that the primary reason for the defeat of that bill was to permit the gentleman from virginia to offer any amendment whatsoever my thinking about offering amendments is that we offer amendments in an effort to improve the legislation and if we are permitted to offer all of our amendmentand all of our amendments pass that means that we have now an ideal piece of legislation and we would support it well i understand that at the committee on rules when the question was asked of the sponsor of those four amendments if they passed and were included in the bill would he support this piece of legislation the answer was no then there is some other reason for offering these motions and these amendments let me say to my colleagues that my reason for objecting to the offering of the amendment is that in my opinion it was not necessary for us to decide again after 19 years on this bill and passing it numerous times i do not think that we ought to be in a position of further trying to deny 3 million federal and postal employees a constitutional right that is guaranteed to all citizens under the first amendment and that amendment that they are talking about that the gentleman wanted to offer would exclude thousands of american citizens in good standing law abiding from participating in the electoral process of this country i think it is tragic that any member would want to deny another citizen the right to participate in politics i think that it is unnecessary for us to have a question of whether we do or whether we do not want to let american citizens some 3 million of them participate in politics i rise in support of the rule this rule provides for full debate of all relevant issues specifically the rule makes in order three amendments it permits an amendment that would prohibit employees of the federal election commission from engaging in partisan political activity the rule permits an amendment to provide that while federal and postal employees may run for local elective public office they will be precluded from running for statewide or federal public office finally the rule permits an amendment that substantially limits the ability of federal employees to solicit campaign contributions under this amendment a federal employee may only solicit accept or receive a campaign contribution if three conditions are met first the employee must be a member of a federal employee or labor organization second the employee may only solicit accept or receive a campaign contribution from a fellow member of that organization finally the employee may only solicit accept or receive a contribution on behalf of the multicandidate political committee of that organization this amendment prohibits a federal employee from soliciting accepting or receiving any campaign contributions from any subordinate employee and the amendment prohibits all federal employees from soliciting accepting or receiving campaign contributions from any member of the general public a few members have expressed concern that by somehow lifting the restrictions the hatch act places on the basic rights of federal employees we are going to unleash a torrent of coercion and intimidation these members apparently feel that notwithstanding theprohibitions in h r 20 federal employees will intentionally seek to vielate the law and abuse their official position i think federal employees are honest responsible citizens who take seriously their obligations and dutiep and fulfill those obligations with honor and credit to the extent that some may think otherwise however this amendment addresses those concerns once and for all by prohibiting solicitation of any member of the public any subordinate employee and any federal employee who is not a fellow member of a federal employee organization assuming this body adopts the amendments that will be offered and i will not oppose these amendments there is no reasonable or logical basis for still opposing this bill one either believes that federal employees should be able to voice their views regarding the politics of the nation or one doesnt this rule also permits a motion to recommit and there will be an upordown vote on final passage to claim that the majority
