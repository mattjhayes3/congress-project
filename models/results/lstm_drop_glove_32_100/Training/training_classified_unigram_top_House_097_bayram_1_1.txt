order by the rule governing house concurrent resolution 115the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is the constructive alternative budget resolution fashioned by the 18 members of thecongressional black caucus of the house of representatives it is the one budget resolution among the four to be considered by the house which responds most succinctly and directly to the mandate given the congress and the president by the american people on november 4 1980 of the four alternatives before us it does the best job of eliminating deficit spending reducing the level of federal spending providing tax relief to the american people and spurring jobs and economic recovery for american businesses and american workers the 18 members of the congressional black caucus are now about to detail for your consideration and debate a resolution that balances the budget in fiscal year 1982 which indeed offers the american people a 7 85 billion surplus instead of the 50 4 deficit that the reaganstockman proposal imposes upon us it is a budget that spends 7 95 billion less than djes the reaganstockman proposal it in a budget resolution that offers the american people 56 4 billion in tax cuts nearly 2 billion more in tax relief than does the reagan stockman proposal and we do it in a fashion that will not concentrate 80 percent of the business and industry tax incentives among the major corporations while providing only 20 percent of the tax relief to the small businesses of the nation which account for 48 percent of private sector gross national products and employ 80 percent of the working people of the country i want you to pay particular attention to the presentations of representative ranoel and representative ford on the tax package that is part of this resolution for it goes to the heart of why we are able to respond best to the mandate of the american people the american people want a new beginning but not a new beginning that is business as usual what good is a socalled tax cut that does not deal with bracket oreep that keeps throwing american workers into higher and higher tax brackets with no real increase in income the reagan proposal continues business as usual inthis regard the congressional black caucus budget resolutionalone among the alternativesgives us a new beginning by correcting bracket creep and returning 17 billion to the american people in tax relief the reaganstockman proposal gives the american taxpayers business as usual when it fails to take into account the increased social security payments that american wage earners and businesses will have to pay this year the cbc budget gives the amer1can taxpayer and small businesses a new beginning a 10percent tax credit on social security payments that returns 10 8 billion zo the american employee and another 7 2 billion to the businesses of our country the 10percent a year acrosstheboard tax cut proposal of the reagan administration is more of the same old thing it will have the average worker earning 15 000 a year paying 93 more in federal taxes by 1984 while the twotenths of 1 percent of the people who earn 200 000 a year will have the government return nearly 20 000 a year to them the american people voted for a new beginning not more of the same old thing with respect to the budget and tax policies of this nation they voted for a balanced budget and reduced federal spending and tax relief not for a legalized raid on the treasury by rich individuals and multinational corporations that will rob the people of 220 billion a year in tax revenues by 1986 they voted for a strong america not an america weekened by throwing 1 1 million people out of work which the reagan human needs budget cuts alone would do in fiscal year 1982 and the fauntroy amendment gives them that they voted for a just and compassionate america not a callous america that would deny a 1 5 billion free lunch to hungry children while continuing a 3 billion free lunch program for the rich that we call the three martini lunch deduction the fauntroy amendiment gives the amerncan people what they voted for it is living proof that the budget can be balanced government spending decreased and tax relief given without necessarily cutting back before yielding to my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to provide you more of the details of our constructive alternative budget resolution let me say three things about this budget resolution that the democraitic study group described as the substitute that takes the boldest step of any proposal being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit that offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house and that accomplishes all of this without hurting other important national programs the first is that while the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is authored by black legislators it is not a program for black people only the most serious problems confronting this nation just happen to be reflected most acutely in the black experience this is a program for all americans the elde ly on limited income most of whom are white the struggling young couples all over the nation who want but cannot find affordable housing anywhere most of whom are white the coal miners whose black lung benefits are being threatened most of whom are white young people from low and middleincome families who would be denied guaranteed student loans and basic opportunity grants for higher education most of whom are white the sick the cold the hungry the handicapped most of whom are white and all of whose burdens will be made heavier by the grammlatta budget proposal thus the solutions we seek are not for black people only but solutions that will benefit all americans black and white together young and old together rich and poor together protestant catholic jew and gentile together the second thing i want to point out is that our constructive alternative budget is based on a different assessment of the root cause of the problem we are experiencing in our domestic economy and the arena of world affairs than that of the reagan administration a in the area of the economy we maintain that inflation unemployment and loweconomic growth are not caused by government spending government taxation and government regulation as the administration would have us believe imprudence in each of these areas contributes to our economic woes and we are as determined as president reagan to sort out waste fraud and abuse at all levels of government expenditures but the fact is that our economic woes have nothing to do with the fact that we provide food stamps for the hungry medicaid for the sick housing for the poor and public service employment for the jobless our economic difficulties are rooted in the fact that other people are making better mousetraps nowadays our difficulties are rooted in the fact that over the past 15 years or more we have had a steady decline in economip performance in manufacturing output in product design and in productivity in sector after sector we are producing insufficient quantities of poorly designed products at too high a price when you do that not only does the world not buy what we make but we do not buy what we make this is best illustrated by an experience which i had a few months ago looking for a christmas gift for my young son marvin he said he wanted a portable radio for christmas i went to one of our local department stores and saw on the shelf a portable radio by rca amfm 87 i was about to purchase it when i noticed on another shelf something called sanyo it said amfm radio three speakers and tape recorder 47 now i love america and i have sense enough to know that when i purchase american made products i am sustaining jobs for americans but when i saw something better for less i must candidly admit that i bought the sanyo and i did it not because i like strange sounding names but because it was a better mousetrap the problem with our economy is that most americans are doing just what i did we are buying datsun toyota kawasaki suzuki honda yamaha panasonic sony seiko nikon and pentax that is our problem and it will not be solved by denying students basic opportunity grants or poor children free lunch or the elderly poor medicaid the problem is that we are losing market shares in the world at large as well as at home the consequence is rising unemployment inadequate profits and therefore reduced investments still worse productivity a falling dollar and still worse inflation our goal therefore must be to restore productivity the competitiveness of unitedstates industry and our other major economic sectors in both domestic and world markets to do this we must undertake the most fundamental reassessment of our economic structure since 1932or perhaps of all time as our colleague representative augustus hawkins has repeatedly pointed out and will do so again today to remedy that problem we must begin to implement the policies called for in the humphreyhawkins full employment and balanced growth act the third thing i should like to say is that the congressional black caucus makes a different assessment of what our problems are in the areas of world affairs our view is that our problems in 1hternational affairs do not lend themselves to military solution they are social economic and political in nature and thus we have emphasized a strong national economy and food and technical assistance as the primary weapons in the arsenal for our confrontation with soviet russia we favor improved national security but without wasteful military spending our budget as representative dellums will point out today calls for defense of our nation not domination of the world our emphasis on the area of foreign affairs must be for example upon development aid and technical assistance to nations like zimbabwe so that mr mugabe may build roads from the chromium mines to the sea where we can buy it sail it to detroit and make a kcair that goes a longer way to empty than does datsun that is what we need to be doing finally our speaker of the house thomas tip oneill has prominently displayed on a desk in his office in the capitol a quote from hubert humphreys last speech on capitol hill on november 17 1977 i think that quote summarizes the choices we must make this week on our budget resolutions he said the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shaows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the three other choices before you this week fail the moral test of government the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute which we now detail for you passes that test with flying colors i yield for the distinguished gentleman from new york to open our presentation of the details of our proposal"], [0.3826482892036438, 0.6173517107963562, 1, "h r 5997 requires that copies of the code of ethics for government service be posted and displayed in buildings housing 20 or more federal employees as you know the code of ethics for government service was adopted as a concurrent resolution during the

offered to provide 200 000 printed and laminated copies of the code suitable for hanging two hundred thousand copies is more than enough to meet the purposes of the legislation further the bill expressly provides for the acceptance of gifts to carry out the program so it is probable that the entire program envisioned in h r 5997 can be carried out without recourse to taxpayers money i really

also want to express particular appreciation to the minority particularly mr madigan mr buoyiill and mr brown of ohio for their support the steel caucus headed by congressman gaydos with the strong efforts of congressmen benjamin and obrien were also very helpful in urging early passage i want to express particular thanks to congressmen walgren and luken who were conferees and who worked very diligently to insure that the conference agreement reflected the needs of workers in this industry they together with senator randolph helped fashion an acceptable compromise in this very difficult area of the senate bill in a manner that clearly expresses the intent of the conferees that the bill provide job security and not result in significant unemployment locally modernization is extremely important to the steel industry because the industry has been short of capital during most of the past decade the objective of any modernization plan is to incorporate the most advanced technology and equipment into the design of the facility the additional capital dollars for investment that will be realized from the stretchout legislation must be spent in such a way to achieve maximum modernization for each dollar to maximize total capital expenditures the industry must have the flexibility to either rebuild existing facilities or construct new ones in many cases rebuilding is more economical and accomplishes the modernlzation objectives the extent to which an existing facility can be modernized depends on the condition of that facility the existing auxiliary and structural parts of any facility that can be utilized should be used to do so will allow the industry to obtain the state of the art in terms of modernization examples of projects which can be modernized through rebuilding are coke ovens and blast furnaces such modernized facilities can effectively improve efficiency and producitivity the bill before us is the house bill the house conferees were able to convince the other body that several of their amendments were unnecessary and possibly could ca se delay in gaining the bills objectives the basic substantive provisions of the tripartite agreement ate intact as worked out by the steel companies the steel workers the environmentalists and epa no changes in their agreement have been made as the house has always urged the parties worked out the agreement in good faith we do not want to undo it in regard to intervention by persons including states the house retained the position set forth in the house committee report of may 22 1981 that section 304 of the act applies to these court proceedings and consent orders the conference agreement restates this it does not change the law on intervention a personhas a right to intervene in court the conferees agree that the epa and the doj should support such intervention we expect the steel industry to also be supportive however epa and doj and the applicant are not required to support any position of the intervenor they can oppose all or part of any such position i believe intervention can help to speed up consideration of an application in the courts the conferees intend this they do not intend that intervention cause delay or be used as a dilatory tactic the new paragraph at the end of section 113 e merely restateq the commitments made by the industry to our committee and

armed forces with civilian law enforcement officials for certain purposes to amend title 10 of the united states code by adding four sections in a new chapter to get the bill out before the membersit is brief not lengthysection 371 permits the secretary of defense to provide federal state and local law enforcement officials any information collected during the course of military operations that may be relevant to a violation of any federal or state law this section does not provide any new authority with respect to gathering information for military purposes it merely provides for the dissemination of such information to civilian law enforcement officials if for example during an awacs training flight aircraft were identified approaching unitedstates international borders the air force could notify unitedstates customs officials to permit them to attempt to identify the nature and the business of this aircraft or if a navy destroyer operating off the florida coast ohserves some suspicious looking ships approaching the coast it could pass this information on to the unitedstates coast guard section 372 the next section permits the secretary of defense to make available to federal state and local officials equipment base facilities research facilities of the armed forces if that action will not adversely affect the military preparedness of the united states this section would provide clear authority for practices which have traditionally been approved by the departments of defense and justice in recent years the military departments have provided assistance to civilian law enforcement officials for example the army has on loan to the unitedstates customs service over 5 million worth of equipment and it loaned armored personnel carriers helmets and flak jackets to the department of justice personnel who participated in the wounded knee incident several years ago section 373 permits the secretary to assign members of the armed forces to train federal state and local law enforcement officials in the operation of military equipment made available by section 372 and to provide expert advice to them again this section clarifies authority for traditional cooperation with civilian law enforcement officials for example the army military police school at fort mcclellan has trained civilians in photographic operations and trained civilian officers in the use of equipment or facilities to them for law enforcement purposes section 374 requires the secretary of defense to issue regulations first to insurethat the provision of assistance equipment or facilities does not impair military training or operations necessary to the military preparedness of the united states and second to insure reimbursement for the provision of assistance obtained from the department of defense when the secretary determines it is appropriate the regulations provided by this section will insure that the cooperation with the civilian law enforcement of f dials does not interfere with carrying out the primary mission of our armed forces that is military preparedness the regulation will also insure that the law enforcement cooperation is not done at the expense of defense activities the results of the armed forces work should not be used at the cost of defense budgets to support the activities of other agencies of government regardless of how laudable those activ ities might be i understand the department of defense has always required reimbursement in the past and it will continue to do so under these provisions section 375 which is the most controversial part of this measure permits the secretary of defense upon request from a federal drug agencyhere we are getting down to a more narrow activity now just a federal drug agencyto assign armed forces members to assist federal drug enforcement officals in drug seizures jand arrests provided first such assistance will not adversely affect military preparedness of the united states second that the secretary determines that the drug enforcement operation may not succeed without the existence of military personnel third drug officials maintain ultimate control of the operation and fourth such assignment shall not occur in any location or circumstance not previously approved by the secretary of state this section would allow drug participation by armed services personnel in drug enforcement operations i should also point out that this direct participation by military personnel is authorized only in drug law enforcement matters whereas the provision of indirect military support relates to law enforcement generally this distinction is made because of the critical need for additional resources in enforcement of drug laws i am pointing out that the early sections of this section 908 are broader then these very narrow ones with regard to drugs heretofore such direct participation has not been possible because of the posse comitatus act section 1385 title 18 united states code that section prohibits the use of any part of the army or the air force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the law posse comitatus is defined by webster as the power of a county the power of a sheriff to summon the whole body of inhabitants to assist in preserving the public peace or in executing a legal order this prohibition originated in the army appropriations act of 1878 it was enacted in response to the use of federal troops to police state elections in former confederate states whtere the civil power had been reestablished and where the union veterans were enforcing the local law the primary concern of the act was the prospect of unitedstates marshals on their own initiative calling up troops to form a posse or to otherwise perform direct law enforcement functions to execute the law although it appears applicable only to the army the law was amended to include the air force when that department was spun off in 1947 although the act by its terms does not include the navy or marine corps the navy has adopted that restriction by selfimposed administrative action clearly the circumstances of 1878 do not prevail today our nation is faced with a crisis of law enforcement international drug dealers because of the tremendous profits of their illicit business can afford the finest and the most sophisticated electronic devices which are capable of penetrating our borders and evading law enforcement officials with immunity limited budgets prevent local state or federal law enforcement agencies from buying the radar or electronic equipment to locate the smugglers but much of the necessary equipment and expertise in the operation are found in the armed forces in order to respond to the challenges of the drug dealers this nation must marshal all of its available resources it can take a large step in that direction by permitting the use of military equipment and personnel in cooperation with civilian law enforcement officials some people say why dont you leave this as it is in the hands of the coast guard it would cost approximately 4 billion to build the coast guard ships needed to do the job if the coast guard were to get these ships after this drug war was over or greatly made unnecessary all these billions of dollars worth of ships would no longer be necessary we would also have to employ many thousands perhaps as many as 20 000 new coast guard personnel section 908 permits the use of the resources of the military departments in the war against drug dealers this section would permit the use of military equipment and personnel without violating the federal governments traditional separation of civilian and military functions participation of military personnel could occur only in drug enforcement and then only with the specific authority of the secretary of defense his approval would depend upon a finding that there would be no adverse effect on milit py readiness second that the drug enforcement operation would not succeed without the participation of military personnel third that the federal drug enforcement officers would maintain ultimate control over the operation not the mllitary fourth that previous approval of the location and circumstances must be given by the secretary of state those last limitations were placed on because of the concern of some people about the rio grande and that possibly there should be some provision that the secretary of state should pass on that before anything like that would be done those limitations will insure that there would be no indiscriminate use of armed forces personnel they will be called upon when it is apparent that the seizure and arrest would fail but for their participation in all situations they will be under the control of civilian federal drug enforcement officials thus preserving the historic separation between civilian and military spheres of activity of our government over the years congress has not hesitated to permit direct participation by the military in matters much less important on several occasions the military has been authorized to assist civilian law enforcement officials in areas such as detention of vessels for customs and in the enforcement of the 200mile limit the epidemic of illegal drugs is a matter of much graver national concern it threatens the morel and physical well being of our entire nation since the posse comitatus law makes any improper military support of civilian law enforcement a federal felo ly military commanders who must often make a speedy decision with regard to whether they can comply with the request have understandably been cautious in construing such requests but any delay can jeopardize important law enforcement operations it is important therefore that the law be as clear as possible in identifying those circumstances in which the military can cooperate lawfully with the civilian law enforcement officers accordingly it is essential that we take this action to amend the law the question then is very simply are we willing to make a commitment to stop drug smuggling or will we wait until those drugs shatter the minds and lives of a genei ation of our young people i believe we must act to protect our youth we must conmnit all of our resources including the military now i made a list of the various places where the posse comitatus law is not applicable by a particular special act of congress such include arresting trespassers in national parks who can be apprehended and arrested by military personnel also to protect against crimes against members of congress including any assault on a member of congress congressmen can call in the military to make such arrests there are many other things of this type protecting indians indian landa civil rights laws customs officials as a matter of fact congress even passed a law some years ago that if you establish a right to bird droppings on an island the military can be called in to make an arrest to protect your property in the bird droppings so certainly if we have these trivial things addressed things of not nearly the significance of drug smuggling we certainly should give assistance in the field of drug enforcement i want to say to the members i am somewhat of an amateur historian and this posse comitatus thing really sprang out of the fact that the people in the south did not want the union veterans to be disturbing them in the way they would like to be undisturbed and they got the power in congress to pass this law and they did what did the real fathers of

years with the federal bureau of investigation as a special agent in different capacities supervisory and otherwise most of it abroad but i have to tell you that i at no time had anything less than the highest respect for mr hoover i had to deal with him personally from time to time frequently as a matter of fact on may return from abroad for special assignments and for conferences but let me just say that mr hoover was the boss and there is no way in the world that any organization any law enforcement organization or any other organization can have more than one boss the buck stopped with him but in referring to what happened on june 3 2 weeks ago the american broadcasting co treated its viewers to a documentary on the life and times of the late director of the federal bureau of investigation john edgar hoover as is typical in the current fashion of television broadcasting this supposedly unbiased view of the career of director hoover which spanned over five decades was a collection of halftruths and oftrepeated criticisms which have been standard fare for those opposed to him and the bureau this documentary represents what is becoming the genre of broadcast investigative journalism the courtroom technique if you will of interrorgating one witness then editing his or her comments and sandwiching them between other hostile comments out of context the viewers are never treated to the full facts nor are they given the full answer it is in fact the camera or the editor acting as the prosecutor and the judge the jury we the viewers are not given the chance to see all evidence we only see what the interviewer wishes us to see that style is fine for feature length movies or a cartoon but not for a documentary about our federal law enforcement agency and its late director the public deserves better the charges against mr hoover as leveled by the american broadcasting co have been heard over and over again and have been leveled by critics of the federal bureau of investigation and mr hoover in other forums previous to that thursday evening these accusations typically range from bureau ineffectiveness the late director being a jespotic tyrant to charges of civil rights violations and political blackmail i think that it is important not only for the sake of the late director but for the outstanding service that the federal bureau of investigation has given this country to set the record straight the federal bureau of investigation was established in 1908 as the investigative arm of the unitedstates department of justice it was called then simply the bureau of investigation at the time it had the responsibility for investigating violation of certain federal laws j edgar hoover was made the assistant director of the bureau of investigation in 1921 at that time the bureau had the reputation of a place of corruption and political intrigue in one of his first directions as assistant director mr hoover organized a handpicked team of trustworthy agents to investigate terrorism in the deep south which was being perpetrated by a renascent ku klux klan on the basis of the investigation of one particularly brutal murder the bureau was able to turn away many prominent supporters of the klan in addition on the basis of a continuing bureau investigation imperial kleagel edward y clarke was indicted on white slavery charges and pleaded guilty at the same time under hoovers orders th i bureau uncovered the practice of selilng black prisoners to local farmers a subseqtent conviction stopped that practice the scandals that rocked the harding administration fully revealed the problems within the bureau of investigation a new attorney general harlan fiske stone had the choice of reforming or dismantling the federal investigative unit judge stone as he later became justice of the supreme court realized the need to have an active and efficient investigative unit at the federal level and knew that its choice of leader was critical in order to rid the bureau of its poor reputation he chose john edgar hoover vho accepted only after he was assured that the bureau would be free from political pressure subject only to the attorney general and that hiring and personnel decisions would be made only on the basis of merit judge stone and loover were determined to create an inestigative bureau that would be the model of integrity and more importantly an efficient uncorruptible arm of justice and the justice department and director hoover achieved that end and it was his promise tc do just that before he would accept the responsibility of being director the bureau instituted the policy of hiring only on merit got rid of all of the political appointees and began the task of becoming the model federal investigative unit in the space of 5 years the bureau had gone from what one writer of the time called a national disgrace to in the words of justice stone a bureau that the government can now take pride in instead of feeling obliged to apologize for it as the nation entered the depression the rate of crime was reaching epidemic proportions during the prohibition era gangsterism flourished as a result of this 7 imate and cases such as the lindburgh kidnapping case the bureaus duties were expanded by such laws as the kidnapping and extortion statutes the federal bank robbery act the national stolen property act and the antiracketeering act and agent were given authority to carry firearms and make arrests which they had not previously had today that expansion has grown to the point that the bureau is esponsible for investigations dealing with violations of over 170 federal statutes including the civil rights act which were imposed by thi congress on the bureau it was during this period that the bureau became prominent and the appellation of gman became popular in the folklore of this period and previously many critics point to this as an example of the use of publicity for the bureau for results that did not warrant such publicity it is important to note that such an appellation and the fear aspect that is implicit in that nickname reflected the great strides that the bureau had made in evolving from a national disgrace to an investigative unit that was given more and more reponsibility as it proved itself the federal bureau of irvestigation succeeded in its war against gangsterism and managed to stop such notorious criminals as george machine gun kelly alvin karpis john dillinger and the barker gang when war broke out in europe and it was feared that it would spread to the united states the federal bureau of investigation assumed another role that of counterintelligence and intercepting potential saboteurs and espionage agents on december 7 when news of the bombing of pearl harbor reached the united states fbi agents were ready and within 24 hours over 1 700 aliens were in custody to the credit of the dedication and hard work of the bureau in cooperation with other intelligence networks not one single enemydirected act of sabotage was committed in the united states during world war ii after the war the bureau again hae its responsibility enlarged with the passage of the atomic energy act the bureau was given the responsibility of safeguarding the secrets of the united states through personnel security checks and surveillance of seditious organizations in the early sixties and as the civil rights movement gained ground the bureau was in the forefront again of investigation of violence related to that movement in the development of the bureau one of the most efficient and respected investigative units in the world mr hoover introduced several concepts unknown in law enforcement he established the identification division in 1924 providing a new concept in identification senator carl hayden of my own state of arizona was instrumental in this effort which entailed an indexed fingerprint chart to help trace criminals he established the fbi laboratory in 1932 to use the benefits of modem science to aid law enforcement in 1935 the fbi national academy was established and remains one of the finest law enforcement education institutions in the world its purpose to train worthy law enforcement officers in administration and police work as the bureau has grown as additional responsibilities were thrown at it it attracted criticisms when director hoover received assurance that the bureau would be free of political influence he kept it that way he opposed any concept of a national police organization as has been charged in the program during the long sessions of the investigation chaired by senator mccarthy it was director hoover that come out against open publication of fbi security files to protect the innocent from any whispering campaign during the early and middle sixties the bureau and the director were charged with racism i find it odd that the charge was leveled because it was the fbi alone that responded to the violence in the early sixties when local law enforcement agenices could not or in some case would not investigate the murders and beating that took place the documentary aired by abc on director hoover tries to smear the bureau and the director with implied charges of fascism blackmail and generally attempting to paint a hardworking dedicated agency as a closed tyrannical society bent on destroying the constitutional right it was charged with protecting in relating the bureaus involvement with dr martin luther king abc implies that the director out of some racist or puritanical hate for dr king put him under surveillance and tried to prevent him from leading the civil rights movement abc patently ignores the fact that u hile wiretaps were authorized on dr king they were authorized by attorney general robert kennedy because of dr kings association with known communists and the fear that the communists would use the civil rights movement to foment other than peaceful change in american society the telecast opens with the line that j edgar hoover imposed his personal vision on congress presidents and on millions of americans the implied notion is that mr hoover used the threat of supposedly existent files on anyone who would defy him if indeed mr hoover imposed this vision on anything it was on the bureau he took a discredited agency and developed it into the most effective and respected investigative body in the world the documentary tries to make a case from the success of the bureau in stopping sabotage in world war ii as more a public relations creation than a fact however it still remains a fact that not one single enemydirected act of sabotage took place in the united states during the war the telecast makes several accusations of the kind that are only fit for cheap irresponsible tabloids the entire last third of the show is dedicated to examples of bureau surveillance and the implication is left that they were done in the attempt to gain leverage in the political arena director hoover was careful since the beginning of his tenure to have a reputable agency that worked to get investigation accepted in court not thrown out it is ironic that the method he most despised innuendo implications are used against him after his death the exercise we saw on abc is how to kick a dead horse his was a vision of protection of the nation and law he loved he battled nazism communism and the ku klux klan with equal fervor he introduced comprehensive law enforcement training in america for the first time he raised the level of law enforcement from that of mere night watchman to a respected profession more importantly he taught us respect for the law the best way to sum up director hoover is found in the book authored by ralph de toledano john edgar hoover did not wear golden shoes he was sometimes wrong many times more right but he lkved america he believed in america and he fought for amerlea for most americans that was enough for those who knew him that was a begin ning jume 23 1982 i have a letter in my hands from our former colleague congressman sam devine who is now

inflation slower economic growth and to a lesser extent the effects of erisa the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the demographics of the future cast doubt on health of the social security system it is difficult to foresee how current levels of support can be maintained yet far too many workers already depend on social security benefits as their sole source of retirement earnings on the other hand individual incentives for personal retirement savings and investment are not emphasized enough new inducements will be necessary to encourage individual retirement intiatives particularly during this era of shrinking disposable income when this aspect of retirement planning is the first to be dismissed the retirement income incentives and adminstrative simplification act of 1981 sets forth the necessary blueprint for building on the strengths and correcting the weaknesses of our present system of providing retirement income by preserving our private pension system and strengthening it through tax incentives and other means the bill sets the stage for expanded capital formation and increased productivity in the 1980s and beyond which will lead to greater retirement income security for all of americas workers and their families title i of the bill establishes the employee benefit adminstration eba a single independent agency to consolidate

commerce and navigation the bill would also have an impact on the scope of jurisdiction of unitedstates courts restricting the access to those courts by foreign workers it would seem to me that such a restriction of the courts jurisdiction should be examined by the judiciary committee before this house votes on it i oppose this bill not only because i do not believe it has been given full consideration i also oppose it on the ontents of the legis lation itself under current law a foreign worker injured while employed on a unitedstates flag vessel or oil production facility has access to unitedstates courts but only after a careful review of the circumstances surrounding the injury standing before the courts is decided on a casebycase basis giving the courts the flexibility to

pass a handgun control bill we wouldnt expect it to stop all violent crime but it certainly could save a great number of lives what are we waiting for i said the next life we save may be our own this bill is a very simple basic bill one that would simply require licensing and registering for all handguns it just seems to me after what happened yesterday that we must recognize that john hinckley if my legislation had been in force would not have been able to acquire the 22 caliber pistol that he purchased just a few days after having been picked up for illegally possessing other weapons we owe it to the president of the united states and to all those who have been exposed to this kind of tragedy to act on this matter immediately the world is watching to see if we really care enough to bring about a basic change in our gun laws"], [5.799531936645508e-05, 0.5000579953193665, 0, "i rise in strong support of the conference report on the municipal wastewvater construction grants amendments of 1981 and i urge my colleagues to do likewise this legislation has been hammered out over the course of the past year with our colleagues in the senate taking into consideration the administrations commitment to reform epas construction grants program and i believe we have done an excellent job under most trying circumstances all of the members who have labored so hard on this legislation are to be congratulated for the product that is before us today special recognition belongs to the chairman of the public works and transportation committee the gentleman from new jersey who provided the strong leadership and encouragement that has been the hallmark of his tenure as public works committee chairman the leadership of our subcommittee on water resources chairman bob roe from new jersey and ranking republican john paul hammerschmidt from arkansas also deserve particular credit for developing the original version of h r 4503 which the house passed just a few weeks ago by the overwhelming vote of 382 to 18 and for negotiating the excellent compromise that is embodied in this conference report and of course the staffs of both the house and senate public works committees on both sides of the aisle should be recognized for their outstanding efforts in connection with this legislation when president reagan took office less than a year ago he initiated a program of major realinement with respect to governmental responsibility the general thrust of his realinement was to reduce substantially the role that the federal establishment plays in the governmental process within this overall context the president proposed reducing the funding level authorized for fiscal year 1982 for epas construction grants program from 5 billion to 2 4 billion furthermore the president proposed no wastewater treatment plant funding until legislation reforming the epa s construction grants program was first enacted into law the conference report on h r 4503 represents the reform legislation that the congress has developed in response to the presidents initiative i believe that the process has been extremely difficult and in some cases a painful one but it has been most beneficial and the president and his emissaries ann gorsuch and john hernandez from the environmental protection agency are to be congratulated for taking the lead with respect to the need to reform this important environmental legislation i agree with president reagans goal of balancing the budget and have supported and will continue to support efforts to achieve that goal at the same time i believe we must be particularly painstaking in our efforts to insure that our budget balancing decisions are the best most informed decisions possible this is especially important with respect to capital investments designed to further the development of the nations commerce and industry and the wellbeing of our people for all thcir contributions to the nation public works investment programs are particularly vulnerable to disproportionate reductions when there are cutbacks nationwvide for budgetary reasons because the programs are national in scope the numbers are large and present a tempting target they are characterized by long leadtimes and therefore are anticipatory they must~ be commenced long before needs become critical the deterioration they are intended to compensate for is slow gradual incremental and diffused cutbacks are not immediately translated into public perception that needs are being shortchanged like our economic system in general they are often taken for granted this situation poses a serious budgetary danger while we quite correctly pursue a course over the immediate future of reducing our federal spending we must strike a very careful balance excess cuts in public works investments could shortchange vitally needed programs and undercut the larger economic objectives which the cuts are intended to achieve in this context it is precisely because i share the presidents vision of a revitalized reirdustrialized america that i accord great priorities to our public works programs on which so much of the economys vitality and the peoples wellbeing depends in other words in attempting to address our immediate economic needs we must guard against actions that could ultimately lead to severely undercutting our nations program of longterm revitalization i am convinced that the package of reforms embodied in the conference report before us today properly recognizes the need to balance budgetary objectives with equally important environmental objectives h r 4503 significantly reduces the level of authorized federal funding for epas construction grants program it does this not because there is either a realization or a perception that we do not have water quality needs greater than those able to be addressed by a 2 4 billion funding level rather the conference report recognizes that in these times of special economic sensitivity the federal government is unable to spend as much money as some would like to address legitimate water quality problems at the same time the amendments to the clean water act made by h r 4503 continue to provide for stability and viability in our nations clean water program i believe that the house in passing the original provisions of h r 4503 and the conferees in fashioning the compromise embodied in this conference report were guided by a number of key concepts first the hallmark of our efforts was balance and consensus for too long we have attempted to solve our problems in an atmosphere of hostility and contentiousness and with this legislation we attempted to create a new and better precedent with respect to the development of essential environmental legislation second we never lost sight of how important it isand will continue to beto preserve and enhance the quality of our nations waters i am convinced that all of the conferees believe as i do that while we inherit the earth from our fathers we also borrow it from our children third even while we sought all possible ways of eliminating environmental hazards we were guided by the conviction that it is impossible for us to have a society that is without risk we recognized that our task must be to identify those risks that are socially acceptable that we willingly assume because the alternatives are far more damaging fourth we viewed achieving our clean water goals in a total or wholistic sense always seeking to balance our environmental objectives against equally important economic social and international purposes there was recognition that economic energy environmental and social objectives were not opposed to one another all must be coordinated in the attainment of the quality of life our people want and to which they are entitled fifth the policies we adopted were i believe founded on sound technical bases with assurance as to feasibility of implementation and with due regard for cost effectiveness implementation will allow for flexibility both in means and schedules to achieve our clean water goals sixth procedures were adopted to expedite decisionmaking in recognition of the fact that unnecessary delay harms botil the environment and the economy seventh we made a special concerted effort to find new and better ways of addressing our water pollution needs strong incentives were developed to create more cost effective resource efficient reliable solutions to our clean water problems eighth the clean water act establishes a national water pollution control program as such the conferees understood that the acet must recognize and be equipped to respond to the legitimate significant water pollution needs of all regions and areas of our country north and south east and west large and small urban and rural ninth because we were dedicated to lessening the heavy federal presence from every area of our nationallife we strived to limit federal intervention to those responsibilities which the national government is uniquely qualified to carry out we attempted to minimize the role that the federal government plays in attempting to solve our problems and emphasized instead reliance on institutions and individuals better equipped to deal with those problems and finally state and local governments were truly given a greater voice in determining environmental policy and a greater role in its administration with the enactment into law of h r 4503 there will be more flexibility in the use of funds given to the states for environmental programs where authority is assigned to state and local levels the delegation is intended to be a true one so that the process is made simple and is not simply the addition of another tier of regulation others have discussed in detail explanations of this confer ence reports provisions i would just like to add some clarification on a few of those provisions section 4 of the conference report directs the administrator of the environmental protection agency to make three grants for certain projects already in epas construction grants pipeline the first involves the expansion of the southeast sewage treatment plant located in the bayview hunters point area of san francisco in order to mitigate the odors noise and visual impacts and other adverse effects on the community identified in epas environmental evaluation of the proposed plant expansion it was agreed that a greenhouse skills training center would be constructed adjacent to the southeast sewage treatment plant the center is to be connected to the plant by pipes which will carry methane to heat the cent er in addition sludge from the treatment plant will be used as fertilizer for the greenhouse a favorable grant eligibility determination and commitment to a 15 million greenhouse skills training project was made on january 22 1981 by the california state water resources control board which acts as epas representative in determining grant eligibility in the state of california however although epa was fully aware of cswrcbs decisions it wa not until several months ago that epaincorrectly the conferees believeinformed san francisco that the greenhouse skills center would not be eligible for grant funding under the clean water act in the meantime the city and county of san francisco had begun construction of the expansion to the southeast sewage treatment plant the second matter intended to be covered by this section involves the greater eureka wastewater treatment project in the eureka project approximately 139 acres of property adjacent to the proposed eureka treatment plant are considered to be environmental mitigation for siting of the proposed treatment plant and holding pond on 16 acres of wetland the 139 acre site is to be dedicated as permanent open space and maintained and managed as a wetland wildlife area having the dual purpose of acting as a demonstration project to improve water quality while at the same time insuring restoration and enhancement of habitat values of a substantial wetland area on november 21 1980 the california state water resources control board issued its concept approval letter informing the city of eureka and the unitedstates environmental protection agency of its determination that the purchase of the 139 acres was grant eligible a little less than 2 weeks later on december 3 the city of eurekas mayor signed and accepted a step ii grant award subsequently epaagain incorrectly we believeoverturned cswrcbs determination and advised the city that acquisition of the 139 acres was not eligible for federal grant funds both of these cases involve epas krefusal to abide by the grant eligibility determination made by the duly appointed agency of a state having construction grants program delegation responsibilities both involve mitigation measures arising from the construction of a granteligible treatment works both situations involve costs associated with an integral part of the underlying grant eligible treatment works in both instances epa erred in refusing to abide by the cswrcbs grant eligibility determination the third project covered by section 4 of the conference report involves what the conferees believe was the need to provide innovative and alternative grant funding for the vascular plant reverse osmosis technology that the city of san diego is proposing for its sewage treatment recycling system section 8 of the conference report deals with providing strong incentives for the use of innovative and alternative technologies and processes as author of the original innovative and alternative technology provisions in the 1977 clean water act i am particularly heartened that the conferees agree that these provisions constitute an important opportunity to make our nations clean water program more cost effective and environmentally beneficial during oui water resources subcommittee hearings on this con~truction grants reform legislation epa testified that to date epa has found that for each dollar invested in the innovative and alternative technology program to provide this incentive 6 is saved in project costs the i a provision contained in this conference report will i am convinced continue this excellent fiscal track record i would just like to highlight one last provision of the conference report section 10 provides a new scheme for federal funding of reserve capacity of special note scction 10 also has the effect of repealing the industrial cost exclusion ice provision of the act section 10 provides that any grant made after november 15 1981 for a publicly owned treatment works will include funding for industrial capacity on the same basis as residential capacity this is a most important provision and is one that was overwhelmingly supported by the house in different form on two separate occasions earlier this year allow me to make one additional point i am convinced that perhaps more than in any other area focusing on the tremendous wealth of talent that exists throughout our nation offers the promise of the best water quality return for our constructiongrants program investment it is a matter of investing in our nations infrastructure i spoke earlier about our national need to reinvest in our infrastructure there i was speaking of capital infrastructure here im talking about something else something perhaps far more important im talking about our political our problemsolving our people infrastructure i have long believed that the best government is the one closest to the people there it is less costly more accountable and more responsible to peoples needs but over the years i believe our people have lost sight somewhat of this fact we have had too much of a tendency to look to someone else to solve our problems to let the federal government dothings for us in the process we have lost many of the most effective solutions to our problems and a great deal of control over our destinies we have let our people infrastructure deteriorate this situation must be reversed nationwide we can begin by truly returning the power and responsibility of government back where it belongs to the hands of the people in this way best of all we will achieve our clean water and other legitimate national objectives i am convinced that the conference agreement on h r 4503 takes a major step in this direction i therefore strongly support its passage today and urge all of my colleagues to do likewise"], [7.295608520507812e-05, 0.4999270439147949, 0, "i agree with the gentleman that the burden on the government is a great one as it should be when we are dealing with first

legislation last year the house passed a pretty decent farm bill that went to conference the conferees accepted the worst provisions they could all through that legislation we came out with a bad farm bill today my farmers are getting less than 2 per bushel for their corn rural america is on the verge of disaster now the senate and the house both passed a provision calling for 10 percent paid diversion program the conferees in complete violation of the rules reduced this to 5 percent and again wrecked a farm program that might have had some help for our farmers farmers are in trouble today with this action they are going to be in even deeper trouble this next year the chairman says everybody is not happy with this conference report you bet your boots that in right some of us are not happy with it nor do i believe that the conferees should be permitted to completely disregard the rules of the house as they meet in that conference i agree that we must live within the budget targets set out in the first budget resolution i voted for the fiscal year 983 budget approved by this house and i believe that the budget reductions called for in this reconciliation bill generally are necessary to assure that the congress maintains the discipline essential to bringing about economic recovery however i am opposing the bill for two reasons first i believe that the conferees charged with negotiating the agricultural provisions of the reconciliation bill blatantly violated the rules of the house limiting the actions of the conference committee to the bounds established by the versions of the agriculture reconciliation bill reported by the respective agriculture committees in my opinion the conferees clearly went outside of the scope of the conference by agreeing to reducing by onehalf the size of the paid diversion programs approved by both this house and the other body i might add that the original paid diversion proposals sent to conference by both houses were approved by an overwhelming majority in both this and the other body second not only did the action of the conferees demonstrate a clear disregard for house rules it also displayed a flagrant lack of concern for the crisis currently facing agricultureespecially farmers in the corn belt corn belt farmers did not ask for special treatment however they did ask for an effective programa program that according to the congressional budget office would actually have reduced federal farm program outlays by minimizing the need for price support loans deficiency payments and storage outlay the action of the conference committee last week was especially inexcusable coming as it did just one day after the unitedstates department of agriculture announced record crops of both corn and soybeans the estimated size of this years cropswhich was totally unanticipated by those in agriculturefell like a bomb shell on farmers already wracked by low prices high interest rates and deteriorating iarm export markets i was tempted to stand here this afternoon and charge that corn belt farmers were sold out by the agrlculture conferees but that charge would imply that the conferees received something in return for forfeiting the chance for an effective farm program next year however as far as i can tell the confereesand farmersreceived nothing as compensation for gutting a responsible farm pro gram they merely backed down in the face of opposition from an administration that neither knows nor cares about the magnitude of the farm problem today i want to restate the fact that the paid diversion program originally sent to conference by both the house and senate would have saved federal farm program dollars farmers have not asked for special treatment but they do deserve a responsible program that recognizes the seriousness of the crisis facing agriculture today i urge opposition to this conference report"]]}
