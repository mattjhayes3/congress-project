colleague the gentleman from georgia stand number one the gentleman knows better this has nothing to do with bugs and insects and cockroaches things like that this has to do with living animals like kittens monkeys hamsters and so on and so forth furthermore it is the prosecutors from around this country federal prosecutors as well as state prosecutors that have made an appeal to us for this and further it is not a requirement of them to prosecute the cases this statute only gives them more tools at their option to prosecute if they deem necessary rather than taking away from as the gentleman says maybe more important cases so i think that that argument is very invalid i do appreciate the opportunity to address the house today on h r 1887 a bill to prohibit the sale of depictions of animal cruelty what do ted bundy and ted kaczynski have in common they tortured or killed animals before killing people many studies have found that people who commit violent acts on animals will later commit violent acts on people district attorney michael bradbury of ventura county in my home district of california came to me because he cannot prosecute people who are involved in promoting and profiting from violent acts to animals the people are making and selling crush videos these videos feature kittens hamsters birds sometimes even monkeys and they are taped to the floor while women slowly torture and crush them to death these videos over 2 000 titles sell for as much as 300 apiece federal and state prosecutors from around the country have contacted me to express the difficulty they have in prosecuting people for crush videos because the only evidence of the crime is on videotape it is difficult to prove that the tape was filmed within the statute of limitations and it is difficult to identify the person in the video further the producer and distributor of the video the person making the big bucks is not violating any current state or federal laws h r 1887 was drafted

gentleman from florida the chairman of the subcommittee his staff the gentleman from illinois the gentleman from michigan and all the cosponsors of the bill i want to thank my district attorney michael bradbury for bringing this to my attention his deputy attorney tom connors and my staff along with the doris day animal league for helping me in my efforts to put an end to this crush video business i ask my colleagues to join in supporting h r 1887 i appreciate the opportunity to rise and speak in favor of h r 1887 a bill to prohibit the sale of depictions of animal cruelty what do ted bundy david berkowitz the son of sam murderer and ted kaczynski have in common they all tortured or killed animals before they started killing people the fbi recently stated that children who torture animals should be considered potentially violent and this may be a factor in profiling a child as the next school shooter many studies have found that people who commit violent acts on animals will later commit violent acts on people planned acts of animal cruelty is a problem that should be taken seriously district attorney michael bradbury of ventura county california came to me because he cannot prosecute people who are involved in promoting and profiting from violent acts to animals the people are making and selling crush videos these videos feature kittens hamsters birds and even moneys that are taped to the floor while women sometimes barefooted and sometimes in spiked heels slowly torture and crush the animal to death the videos sell for up to 300 and more than two thousand titles are available for sale nationwide people who buy the videos purchase them to satisfy their sexual foot fetish federal and state prosecutors from around the country have contacted me to express the difficulty they have in prosecuting people for crush videos because the only evidence of the crime is the videotape it is difficult to prove that the tape was filmed within the statute of limitations and it is difficult to identify the person in the video further the producer and distributor of the video the person making the big bucks is not violating any federal or state laws the state law on the books and the lack of a relevant federal law leave the prosecutors empty handed the current law is insufficient to prosecute crush videos h r 1887 targets the profits made from promoting illegal cruel acts toward animals the bill was drafted very narrowly to protect the freedom of speech guaranteed by the first amendment in order to be prosecuted for this proposed law one must first violate a state or federal animal cruelty law in creating a depiction of a live animal then the person must sell the video or intend to sell the video across state lines the first amendment would not protect videos that are made for profit and that are filming someone violating an existing law the state has an interest in enforcing its existing laws right now the laws are not only being violated but people are making huge profits from promoting the violations some of the leading constitutional lawyers in the nation helped me draft the bill in addition following a hearing in the crime subcommittee this legislation was amended to further ensure that it does not infringe upon the first amendment the bill specifically excludes any depiction that has serious political scientific educational historical artistic religious or journalistic value as amended the bill does not prohibit groups such as the humane society of the united states from creating an educational documentary on animal cruelty the value of crush videos is de minimis crush videos would not fall within the specific exceptions to the bill the sick crush video business must end the cruelty to animals must stop

century it will in fact be the last budget of the 20th century as we move forward we need to set our priorities this will be a long process as we go through the summer and into the fall in deciding what those priorities should be in passing a budget i rise today to emphasize the importance of fiscal discipline fiscal responsibility and paying down our debt as we move through that process i feel that should be the number one priority of this body in the budget process and for the future as it is what can best help the people of this country we still have a significant financial problem the news has gotten better in recent years we have reduced the yearly size of the deficit and we actually have the possibility of moving towards a surplus all of that is good news and many people on both sides of the aisle and many congresses through the past 6 or 7 years can rightfully take credit for that but the job is not done i worry a great deal as i listen to the debate and listened to the debate this past week on the budget resolution that people have lost sight of that fact we are talking about surplus politics and i think we do so prematurely to begin with we still incorrectly from an economic standpoint cbunt the surplus in the social security trust fund as income to the treasury and use that surplus to claim an overall surplus when in fact we have an overall deficit last years numbers make this point clearly we had a 100 billion surplus in the social security trust fund the rest of the budget actually ran a 30 billion deficit so presto we have the 70 billion surplus that everybody has been talking about it does not really exist but that surplus in the social security trust fund is already obligated we have to pay it back plus interest to the treasury so that the trust fund can pay out the social security benefits that all of us or all of us hopefully some day that many of us are due so it is not money we can count as a surplus to count it that way is to spend it twice when we spend money twice we wind up in debt as far as we are the second critical point in this is we still have an overall debt that 70 billion surplus mythical though it may be even within the grounds of that myth is only a 1year surplus with quotations around it the overall debt continues to grow it is approaching 6 trillion on a yearly basis we pay 215 billion to service that debt that is 15 percent of the budget 15 percent of our budget and 250 billion that basically goes simply to pay off past excess it does nothing to meet our obligations at present or in the future and it should be reduced now is the time to do it we have a very strong economy we have unemployment at 4 2 percent we have virtually nonexistent inflation a booming stock market with growth to match if we cannot begin to pay down that debt now we never will we will never get there if we do not take that step right now we need to step up to that as a priority i am concerned as i look at the debate that we had on the budget resolution that we are not heading in the right direction i basically lookat the budget resolution of this week that was passed in the house as a bad newsgood news situation the bad news is it is not a particularly good budget resolution and the debate was even worse from a fiscally responsible and economically accurate standpoint but the good news is it borders on meaningless what really is going to matter is the 13 appropriation bills that both bodies have to pass between now and october there is no way that those 13 appropriation bills are even going to come close to matching what was in that budget resolution i say that is good news because the budget resolution overpromised in a number of different areas essentially by holding back key specifics the budget resolution was able to promise in a number of interesting areas promise more spending on defense although they added another little trick in there that they promised budget authority but not necessarily outlays what is the difference between budget authority and outlays we ask it is the difference between promising to spend money and actually spending it there is a big difference between those two things beyond that the pledges for increased spending in defense in education while at the same time including a massive back end tax cut and by back end i mean it grows in the out years in the first 5 years it is not too much in the second 5 years it is more in the third five years it is even more all of that for all of that to work within any sort of fiscally responsible framework requires cuts in the rest of the budget that nobody is prepared to make and therefore were not spelled out in that budget resolution for some very good reasons if they had been spelled out nobody would have voted for it and it would not have passed so the budget resolution was more or less a political document an effort to try to gain favor in some areas by playing various tricks and smoke and mirrors games with the budget numbers so it is not going to happen but we are going to have a situation where we are going to have to pass a real budget what is going to happen is all of those promises that were made during the budget resolution debate are going to be very tough to meet in reality what is going to happen my fear is that what is going to happen is exactly what happened in the 1980s long before i got to congress actually when i was in high school and college and watched with horror as my predecessors in this body spent all of our future money basically what happens is an agreement is reached that goes something like this i will take your tax cut if you take my spending increase that works out just fine for that congress they are able to pass out a lot of goodies and make every one happy but it sets up a situation that i among others walked into in the mid 1990s basically it is like showing up at the time that the credit card bill comes due it is not a lot of fun and it is not good for the country because i understand the federal government has many positive things that it needs to do it has spending programs in the areas of education in the areas of defense environmental protection medical research it has tax cuts it can do all of those things are important but they are not peculiar to this one moment in time ten years from now 20 years from now 30 years from now and beyond residents of this country are going to have needs in all of those areas needs that they will not be able to meet if we spend the money now irresponsibly i am afraid that we are headed in that direction by overpromising by talking about the politics of a surplus and where can we spend the money where should we spend the money what tax cuts we should do way beyond what we can actually afford to do and not even taking into account the nearly 6 trillion debt that we have run up over the course of the last 30 years let us be fiscally responsible and start paying that down worse than that the debate as i watched it degenerated into a criticism of the clinton budget and a battle over who is quote setting aside more for social security there are a couple of problems with this argument first of all it allowed many of the majority party who supported their budget to not even really talk about their budget but rather try to focus their attention on proving that the presidents budget that he introduced 3 months ago was bad that may well be in fact an amendment was offered by a member of the majority that was supposedly exactly the presidents budget it was defeated i think with only two votes voting in favor of it from the time that budget was introduced many things have changed many other ideas have come up the budget is a dead issue yet that is what the majority party spent most of its time talking about i would have much preferred them to have spelled out some of the specifics of their own resolution i also would have much preferred them to be a little bit more honest in their analysis of that budget i brought a chart with me which i saw frequently on the day that the budget resolution was debated being brought up and put forth by the majority party as evidence that their budget was better for social security than the presidents was i bring this chart up mainly for illustrative purposes to show howwell dishonest might be too strong a word we are supposed to not say things like that in this honest bodylet us say how disingenuous the debate was i will put that chart up now this chart shows the commitment on social security it is interesting the republicans argument throughout the whole budget was that their budget sets aside 100 percent of the social security trust fund or sorry 100 percent of the surplus for social security whereas the president only sets aside 62 percent the interesting thing is and they absolutely had to be aware of this fact the 62 percent that they are talking about or sorry the 62 percent that the president was talking about was 62 percent of the entire surplus whereas the number that the republicans were referring to in their budget was 100 percent of the social security surplus so basically the president was talking about 62 percent of a much larger number in fact a fascinating fact is this 62 percent of that much larger number is almost exactly the same as that 100 percent in other words there is no difference whatsoever yet the majority got up here and argued repeatedly that their budget was better because it set aside 100 percent instead of 62 percent it is just exactly that sort of disingenuous use of fact that colored the debate and got us way off the topic that topic ought to be fiscal responsibility if we want to do something about social security and medicare and that is really a third point in addition to the two prior points about how our budget situation is not as rosy as it is those being one that we still count the money that we borrow from the social security trust fund two we have an existing debt three is the coming bills on social security and medicare once the baby boom retires those exploding bills that are out there and what we are going to do about them nowhere in the budget resolution does it say anything about any sort of medicare or social security reform to deal with those problems if we do not that is going to further exacerbate our financial situation the level best thing that we can do for dealing with those programs well there is two things one we can reform the two programs but two is to not spend the money now because the interesting thing about this chart is both the president and the republicans are being somewhat disingenuous in arguing about how much money they quote unquote are setting aside for social security we cannot bind future congresses in that way as future congresses pass budgets they will decide whether or not to spend this money on social security medicare or someplace else it will require a yeartoyear decision to decide what to do with that so to say that we are setting it aside now is somewhat empty rhetoric except for this point it is arguable that the extent to which we are fiscally responsible now in other words the extent to which we do not spend money or do not give out tax cuts that further inhibit our ability to have revenues for social security and medicare to the extent we do that we will be in a better position to deal with social security and medicare in the future so the number one biggest test aside from all this baloney with the charts this effort to confuse people by taking two separate numbers and treating them as the same when they are not look at the budget and see if it is fiscally responsible that is the test on whether or not we are preparing for dealing with the coming increases in cost and social security and medicare again when we look at the budget resolution we passed this week it promised 800 billion in tax cuts over 10 years actually that number balloons even further in the next 5 years over a 15year period it also promised massive increases in a number of different areas of spending all of that will jeopardize this chart considerably that is what we need tolook at as we debate the budget in the months ahead because as i said the hard work is yet to come we have basically done the smoke and mirrors twisted the numbers around to make them look as good as possible now we actually have to pass realistic appropriations bills that is going to be far far more difficult than simply passing a piece of rhetoric i rise today to urge fiscal responsibility balance the budget and pay down the debt that is the best thing we can do for society today and in the future i am pleased to yield to the gentleman from arkansas a colleague who will help in this argument i appreciate

agriculture economy is in dire straits american farmers are reeling from the twin evils of production loss caused by natural disasters and price collapse caused by depressed export sales and strong global production the crisis in agriculture demands a multifaceted response from congress ranging from emergency assistance crop insurance reform safety net reform and expanding international trade it is this last issue of expanding trade that i will discuss this evening perhaps no sector of the american economy is any more dependent on trade than agriculture the united states is the single largest exporter of ag products in the world on average the crops on one out of three acres in the united states are exported many commodities are even more dependent on foreign sales such as wheat 1 out of 2 acres is exported sunflower oil 3 out of 4 acres of which is exported given the share of farm income that depends on foreign markets american farmers cannot succeed and prosper without robust export sales now unfortunately the export market for agriculture has been anything but robust in fact the value of unitedstates agriculture exports has fallen from 60 billion in 1996 to a projected 49 billion this year a decline of nearly 20 percent look at this chart it tells a very sad tale it is a small wonder we have had that incredible depression in our ag economy with the export record like that there are several reasons for the decline in export sales they include the financial crisis in asia despite signs of recovery we continue to see sales lagging in this region not rehabilitated to what they were prior to the crisis strong worldwide production has further depressed exports and in turn depressed the prices for our ag commodities in addition to these market forces however american farmers are on the losing end of export sales because of an unlevel playing field in the international market around the world our american farmers are not just competing with farmers of other countries in other parts of the world relative to their own exports we are competing against their governments as well as they subsidize unfairly their export market the crops grown by american farmers face on average a tariff rate of 50 percent in foreign markets compared to just 10 percent on what ag products face entering our market with respect to export subsidies the european union accounts for 85 percent of world export subsidies just take a look at my second chart this evening the blue reflects european exports our slender 2 percent compared to their 85 percent of world export subsidies reveals just why our exports are not performing and why our ag exports are on the losing end of the present trading situation in addition to export subsidies we know that state trading

allocations it grows tougher to produce a defensible bill but my chairman has done a decent job with the resources allocated to him the biggest flaws in this bill flow from the artificially low allocation and the choices it has forced on the subcommittee despite a very sound economy and healthy onbudget surpluses which cbo in its midsession review is soon expected to increase the committee on appropriations remains bound by artificially low allocations which prevent us even from keeping all of our agencies at their current services level and making funding important new initiatives virtually impossible this is a time when we should take advantage of the economy and the surpluses to invest directly in our people and in our nation through programs to narrow the growing income and opportunity gaps and strengthen the economy not just hope investment will trickle down from tax cuts for the wealthiest americans which is i think a foolish way to look the chairman of our subcommittee has provided some increases for high priority law enforcement functions but overall the bill is not balanced there are serious shortfalls in areas that are important to members on both sides of the aisle even within the justice department the emphasis is on prisons and detention not the programs that protect americans civil rights or address crime or crime prevention at the local level the same is true for the related agencies that protect civil and employment rights the commerce department is virtually frozen without even the inflationary increases needed to maintain current services for its vital activities let me mention only three problems with commerce and related programs trade monitoring and enforcement will need more resources not less to assure compliance with the newly enacted africa trade law and with china pntr even though supporters of both pledge muscular enforcement the statistical activities that produce the data that underlie our economic decisionmaking have been declining under hard freezes for years despite enormous changes in our economy and we are approaching the point when basic data sets may become unreliable noaa with its critical work on weather the health of our air and water coasts and oceans and so much more is cut 113 million below fiscal year 2000 and more than half a billion dollars below the 2001 request this certainly leaves no money for commerces proposed initiatives including two of particular importance to me creating a pool of minority candidates for scientific and technical jobs at noaa and nist through minorityserving institutions and bridging the widening digital divide between the haves and havenots of the information age in the state department the funding for embassy security is certainly welcome and necessary however provisions fencing part of our u n dues pending a certification that cannot be made until well into the fiscal year and holding our contributions to international peacekeeping at the current years level will reduce our leverage for continuing reform at the u n and put us back in arrears to the u n the funding shortfall for the small business administration will

slorc dictatorship in burma for the role of the worlds largest producer of heroin they are harboring antiamerican terrorists like osama bin laden and other murderers who have killed and maimed

wellbeing of tens of millions of women who live in muslim countries around the world now here is the kicker under the clinton administration the taliban has established control over most of afghanistan and has wiped out its opposition rather than being a force to combat the expansion of the taliban it appears that the united states under this administration has acquiesced to taliban rule and even undermined the resistance to the taliban in short it appears that the united states may have a covert policy of supporting the taliban as a senior member of the committee on international

a proposal to relocate an outpatient health care clinic operated by the southern indian health council sihc in alpine california the stated purpose of the relocation is to permit the cuyapaipe to construct a gaming casino on the clinic property which the cuyapaipe claim as their reservation the southern indian health council was organized in 1982 by seven indian tribes in southern san diego

patients per year many of whom are from low income families the bureau of indian affairs bia has recently rejected the cuyapaipe tribes application to build the casino finding the paperwork incomplete this provides a temporary stay of construction leaving the door open to the future conversion of the cuyapaipes health care center into a casino the legislation before us today prevents the tribe from using the clinic property to build a casino nothing in this legislation will prevent the cuyapaipe from establishing gaming facilities on their traditional homeland this bill does not affect the

funds the ricky ray hemophilia relief act found in this years appropriations bill i think my colleagues will remember last year congress enacted the ricky ray bill which provides compassionate assistance from the federal government for victims of hemophilia associated aids this law responds to that awful tragedy that has impacted the lives of thousands of americans and continues to do that this is the first year that we have sought funding for the ricky ray program and i was grateful to see the committee on appropriations was receptive to beginning the funding process by allocating 50 million for fiscal year 2000 i certainly understand how difficult the appropriations process has been this year i think we all do so i am especially pleased that we are moving forward on this critically important program i know the hemophilia community wishes we could allocate more money this year the actual total funding would be 750 million but i am hopeful that as the process continues the committee on appropriations will continue work to see that we set aside more funds i have a letter from the national hemophilia foundation expressing appreciation which i would like to insert in the record at the appropriate point i know many americans will join me in thanking our colleagues the gentleman from illinois the gentleman from florida the gentleman from florida for finding a way to start the funding for this program i do not believe the sky is falling i think good things are happening i think this proves it i urge support for the rule and for this bill the letter referred to is

made most importantly the key factor here is choice in the gentlemans remarks he pointed out that most of us at least most of us in the workforce those who have a job if we are lucky enough to have health care at this point in time if we have health care coverage we likely get that health care coverage through our employer that is good because it means we have health care coverage and that is an advantage but there are some tragedies involved in that structure first of all it means that thousands of americans tens of thousands of americans indeed 44 million americans who are uninsured they do not get the chance to get their insurance through their employer so many of them do not have any insurance at all that is not right and we need to deal with the problem of the uninsured i think the right way to deal with it is to give them a refundable tax credit and let them go buy an insurance policy that is theirs that is a portable insurance policy that belongs to them and lets them go buy the health care plan they want but the other problem with the other half of this structure is those people that get their insurance from their employer the problem with that structure is we lose all choice if we work for any employer in america large enough to buy health care insurance we are offered either one choice or a fairly small list of choices unless we work for a very very large employer i like to talk about joe jordans mexican food restaurant which is where my wife shirley and i went on our second date joe jordan and his family did not go into the mexican food business because they thought they were good at buying health insurance they went into the mexican food business because they were good at making and cooking mexican food and yet under our structure today joe jordan has to select the health insurance for his employees and they get no choice we can change that we could go back to a system where we gave individual people choice in health insurance and let them buy the health insurance that meets their needs and the key to that would be if the plan they bought did not satisfy their needs if they went out and bought an hmo because they thought it was the most costeffective type of care they wanted and that hmo did not service their needs or do a good job by them or their family they could fire that hmo and go hire another one the gentleman from oklahoma said we would not need a patients bill of rights if health care were a matter of choice but it is not we get it through our employers earlier this year i introduced legislation to give people choice to let them buy a health care plan of their own or to let their employer give them essentially the right to go buy with his funds their own health care plan with that kind of choice we would as the gentleman said we would not need a patients bill of rights because if their hmo did not treat them right they would fire that hmo and they would go buy an hmo that serviced them well and did a good job by them just like they do with their auto insurance company or homeowners insurance company or any of the decisions they make in there lives but we are at the point where we are debating on the floor of this house we have all year and indeed last year as well the issue of a socalled patients bill of rights i think it is important to talk about the differences and the choices in that legislation and why the bill that passed this floor is so bad and indeed would do damage to health care in america i would like to do that with the charts down there so the gentleman and i will trade places this chart right here kind of shows the fundamental question that faces america on the issues of health care for the working people of america who get a health care plan from their employer it is a simple straightforward question health care in america who should make the decision you get three choices hmos lawyers or doctors and patients i think the answer to that question is very obvious i think doctors together with their patients ought to make medical decisions in america but it is important to understand how the system works today the system works today to say doctors and patients do not get to make the choice no the system today provides that hmos make medical decisions indeed hmo bureaucrats often make medical decisions but somebody out there watching might say well why are lawyers on this chart that does not make any sense i thought it was a battle between hmos on the one hand and doctors and patients on the other hand well that is what one thinks it should be but that is not what it is because some of the legislation that has gone through this house and the legislation that the president talks about the legislation that is discussed by our democrat colleagues would not leave power in the hands of hmos indeed it would take power away from hmos but sadly it would not move that power over to patients and doctors it would instead move that power to trial lawyers and that will set health care back rather tragically since the gentleman is a doctor perhaps he would like to comment on that"], [0.8939138054847717, 0.8939138054847717, 0, "today the sierra club a group

president by the american legion about our involvement in kosovo and i quote the american legion a wartime veterans organization of nearly 3 million members urges the immediate withdrawal of american troops participating in operation allied force the letter went on to outline resolution number 44 the american legions statement on yugoslavia that was adopted unanimously by their organization on may

the president of why it is in our vital national interests to engage in operation allied force two guidelines be established for the mission including a clear exit strategy three that there be support of the mission by the united states congress and the american people four that it be made clear unitedstates forces will be commanded by unitedstates officers whom we acknowledge are superior military leaders the legion believes that at least three of these conditions have not been met and if they are not all met then the president should withdraw american forces immediately i agree with this position the president has committed the armed forces of the united states in a joint operation with nato operation allied force but has not yet clearly defined what americans vital interests are in this region the american people have a right to know why we are there the president in eight weeks of military action has not properly defined what the specific objectives of nato are nor has the white house defined an exit strategy and if my colleagues will remember the president promised our nation that the unitedstates military forces would be out of bosnia in one year three years and six

there for just 1 year once again i continue to be troubled with americas participation in this conflict unitedstates forces continue to carry the overwhelming share of the military burden rather than our european nato allies only 13 of natos 19 member nations are actively engaged in operation allied force american pilots are flying some 90 percent of the missions it also seem to me that the

homes were lost families were destroyed they witnessed the havoc which trade wars and military wars and the protectionism that comes from trade wars can bring and they vowed not to let it happen again

was not perfect so we tried to correct some of the deficiencies of the past by creating the wto which would further liberalize trade and provide for an even stronger dispute settlement procedure again i believe the system has worked especially for the united states in the first year of implementation unitedstates exports rose 14 4 percent seven h4796 co tines greater than the gdp growth in that

to the federal railroad administrations proposed rule for trains to sound their homs at public crossings let me first state that i do not oppose efforts by the fra or any other part of the department of transportation to improve safety each year there are over 35 000 transportation related deaths in america we must reduce this terrible statistic in fact safer travel is the basis for my opposition to this proposed regulation in my opinion the approach taken by the fra to prevent train crossing accidents is extreme i believe that the spending mandated by this regulation would be wasteful and ultimately not improve safety these scarce dollars and resources can be used more effectively saving more lives if spent in other areas implementing this rule would draw funds away from other important safety measures for drivers pedestrians and other travelers on americas roads in illinois and elsewhere the main parts of the proposed rule are now well known trains must blow their homs at all public grade crossings unless a new level of safety measures is installed while there is flexibility in the types of safety measures and the time in which they must be installed this sweeping regulation is flawed for several reasons first the fra data used to conclude that blowing homs at crossings reduces accidentsfails to count a significant number of crossings and fails to properly classify and incorporate the nature of the accident in fact data has beencompiled which indicates that in certain regions of the country my district being one of them there is a decrease in the number of accidents in places where train horns are prohibited from sounding further the data does not account for the vast differences in vehicular traffic at the rail crossings where informationwas gathered second the majority of the data used by the fra to formulate this proposal came from a multiyear study of areas in florida that had implemented and then repealed bans on train horns at crossings in myopinion the specific data from the florida crossings isneither applicable nor appropriate to determine the need for horn bans in the majority of the otherstates in cook county illinois there are more gate crossings than in the majority of states in the country third a recent illinois study of detailed data compiled between 1988 and 1998 highlights several important facts that should be considered by the fra for example train accidents involving vehicles remains a rare occurrence resuting in less than one percent of highway fatalities further the study found that of train related vehicular accidents over forty percent occurred because the driver circumvented the existing safety measures of the remaining accidents a significant percentage occurred when a vehicle impacted against the side of a train rather than the train striking a vehicle from these facts we can conclude that in many cases the safety measures currently in place are adequate for those citizens who chose to use them and expenditures to further improve these safety measures would be better spent little consensus exists on whether the data and analysis used by the fra to support their position is correct and whether the proposed rule is good public policy from any standpoint before forcing states and communities to pay for massive investments in rail crossing safety measures this issue must be resolved i ask the federal railroad administration to consider the tens of thousands of citizens in illinois and millions across the country that would be greatly impacted both financially and physically by this onerous proposal and to change the rule at a minimum the individual states should have much more flexibility to decide where they need to spend funds for transportation safety"]],

quite a few people across the united states that have not really found out about our group here in the congress on the democratic side but the reality is that one of the reasons i really enjoy being a part of this group is because i do have a financial background having a degree in economics and an mba in finance and having been in the financial industry for 14 years before i got to this congress it is always important to me to apply the financial rules that i know that i use in my daily life or that i would expect somebody coming through the front door and asking for a loan to apply and first and foremost of that of course is what is your liability situation what are your assets what is the income that you are earning or what you think you are going to have as far as money coming in on a monthly or annual basis and it should not be any different for what we do here in congress first and foremost when we have the good times as my colleague from north carolina said when the sun shines we need to think about what we do with this extra money that is coming in most families most businesses a lot of us pay down the liabilities that we have we pay down our debt if we have gotten into tough financial times and we have had to go to the bank or we have had to put a second mortgage on our home and then if it gets worse we go and we use the credit cards we get through the mail sometimes a little too easily these days but we go and we get the credit where we can get it and every time i am sure most families think they are going to get the credit at the least amount and then as they need more they get more and more credit at a higher rate this is what we did during that 1980s time period we increased the debt to pay several programs that we had ongoing without the money coming in to pay for thoseprograms now we are in the reverse now we have a good economy we havea strong economy but it is not going to last forever so what do they do when they finally have that good job where they are getting the extra money first they pay down the credit cards then they take the second mortgage off of their home they pay back their family the money they borrowed and maybe they keep a little bit of debt but they certainly do not keep all of that debt because there will be at some point some sort of a downturn and they have to prepare for that sometimes we forget about that when we are in the good times we have had 71 2 years of really good times in the united states and i as a lawmaker want to see all the people in my district and as many americans continue that but things do change and we all know that today we have a prime example of that when i was younger and first driving my first car i remember standing in lines of 50 cars waiting to try to get some gas into my car the last time we had a real oil crisis at that time we paid almost anything just as long as we could get that gas in our cars to run it while we were going through that we said to ourselves as a nation as a people we said never again were never going to let this happen again to us were going to drive more efficient cars were going to find alternative fuels as the good times came we began to forget that today about 15 or 20 years later here we sit again and guess what the prices of gas are going up i sit there and i think to myself maybe we will have a recurrence of this so we have to remember things go in cycles we are in the good part of the cycle we need to take that money and we need to pay down the debt the blue dog budget does that it says lets take care of the first thing first it also says we are not afraid of tax cuts we realize that we can give tax cuts to people tax cuts that are important if you are investing in a business if you are investing in research let us allow american businesses and people to do that if you are investing in yourself if you are investing in your children by getting an education let us help americans decide that that is the right thing to do if we want to invest in our schools and new school construction like we all run around and say then let us give tax credits so communities will step up to the plate and do what is right and build that new classroom or build that new high school that they need our budget allows americans to do that it also allows us to work on the programs that need to be worked on like

when the uintah indian reservation was opened for settlement in 1905 land was auctioned to the highest bidder under the township act and the city of duchesne was created the acting indian agent of the

state engineer utah is an arid state and water is a valuable resource the very nature of water rights ownership can be contentious for this reason the legislation is urgent and necessary the city of

delegation for organizing this special order to pay tribute to a dear friend bruce vento bruce vento was a dear friend and a dear colleague of mine who i greatly respected and admired even though i have had the privilege of serving with him for the past 4 years in the united states congress i knew of bruce vento as an admirer from afar given his work on conservation and environmental measures and as a resident of western wisconsin just across the river from his congressional district since coming to congress i had the privilege of serving with him on the committee on resources and the subcommittee on national parks and public lands and he was a natural leader on the committee on resources unquestionably given his profound interest and depth of knowledge and expertise on these issues of 24 years serving on the committee on resources 10 of those years as chair of the subcommittee on national parks and public lands to which the nation owes him a debt of gratitude his strong leadership on the committee on resources resulted in protecting hundreds of thousands of acreage and the enactment of over 300 laws preserving the environment from the boundary waters canoe area wilderness area a place that holds special meaning to me since i try to get up there for a week every summer with some brothers and friends to spend time in the boundary waters area canoeing and camping to the minnesota national wildlife refuge to the new parks and wilderness that were created in alaska and even in american samoa as our good friend just stated earlier what especially impressed me about bruce vento was his concern about some of the most disenfranchised and politically powerless people that exist in our country from the homeless to his concern for housing issues but especially his tireless advocacy for the hmong population in this country both bruce vento and i share a sizable hmong population in our respective congressional districts that is why i was especially proud to be able to join forces with bruce on a number of issues that affected hmong rights but most particularly the hmong veterans naturalization act that bruce championed for quite a few years and which ultimately was passed into law this year that recognizes the tremendous contribution that hmong veterans and their families gave unitedstates armed services personnel during the war in southeast asia these were people who fought side by side with our veterans of the vietnam conflict they were there building the landing strips for our air personnel they were there rescuing downed pilots during the vietnam war and they were the ones who were most persecuted after the war many of whom were able to seek refuge and safety in the united states but these were not a very politically powerful or a large political constituency and they were a group of people who were in search of a leader to represent their views and to bring fairness and decency to their cause and that is what bruce vento provided them this was not a political issue for him but it was an issue of doing right by our friends and allies and recognizing their contribution perhaps there are going to be many living legacies that bruce vento has given us in this nation but i could not think of one more important or more lasting than providing a home in a country for the hmong population who live with us today the people in minnesota and wisconsin and the entire united states will sorely miss congressman bruce vento i am proud to have served with him and to have called him my friend but i especially appreciated the moments we shared together on our numerous flights to and from the twin cities and out here to washington he and i would oftentimes be sitting next to each other which gave me a wonderful opportunity to pick his brain and talk about legislation and policy issues i enjoyed listening to his stories of his recent bike trips that he enjoyed doing time and time again but i especially liked listening to his stories about his family for a guy who was as busy and as committed as bruce vento was on the great public policy issues of our day and the work that he did in the united states congress he always kept family first he was so proud of his children but especially proud of his grandchildren you could just see his face light up with joy and excitement talking about his latest discovery of a grandchild or of seeing the world anew through his grandchildren that for a young member of congress that drove home a very important point and lesson that i have committed to my own service here that
