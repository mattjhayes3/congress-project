by many of the republican conferees further these republican conferees would be willing to mortgage the cost of this gift to the wealthiest taxpayers on the back of every man woman and child in this

cafta this trade agreement will eliminate thousands of american jobs without raising the quality of life for central americans and dominicans it is an agreement written to raise profits for multinational corporations at the expense of workers and the environment in the unitedstates and the cafta countries cafta should be renegotiated or voted down there is wide bipartisan opposition to this bill here in the congress because it endangers workers and jobs in the unitedstates and abroad it endangers our economy and it endangers the environment opposition to congressional ratification

owners and the clergy all strongly oppose the measure hundreds of thousands of central americans have taken to the streets to protest cafta i strongly support increased global trade for the united states however when negotiated i believe free trade agreements should place human and labor rights and the protection of the environment on an equal par with the rights of capital while cafta provides extensive protections for goods and capital it provides no new protectioos for workers or the environment and allows the signatory nations to do nothing more than enforce their own laws on labor and the environment implementation of cafta would further the failed experiment that was nafta as a result of nafta my home state of illinois has suffered the loss of over 100 000 jobs the nation hds lost almost 1 million jobs due to the displacement of production that supported them prior to the implementation of nafta free trade agreements like nafta and pntr for china perpetuate the race to the bottom in the global economy they lower working and living standards for workers in other countries and kill jobs in the united states caftas effects would be no different the labor provisions in cafta are intentionally unenforceable violations of core labor standards cannot be taken to dispute resolution the commitment to enforce domestic labor laws is subject to remedies weaker than those available for commercial disputes this violates the negotiating objective of current unitedstates trade law that equivalent remedies should exist for all parts of an agreement further the enforce your own laws standard allows countries the opportunity to rewrite and weaken their labor laws to attract investment instead of pursuing policies that undermine the rights and security of unitedstates workers and workers in other countries the united states should lead the world by example through a trade policy that improves the lives of individuals and does not just add to the profits of major corporations our policies should benefit workers here in this country create and sustain jobs and help our small and mediumsized and familyowned businesses grow cafta will not accomplish those goals nor will it offer better opportunities to the people of central america and the dominican republic the abysmal working conditions in mexico should serve as a sign of what cafta will bring to central america and the dominican republic the mexican middle class that was supposed to arise as a result of nafta is missing i visited ciudad juarez on the tenth anniversary of nafta instead of finding a thriving mexican middle class i found workers living in the packing crates of the products that they were manufacturing the poverty rates and disparities in wealth in mexico have actually grown since nafta cafta would just spread those conditions further south by offering multinational corporations new opportunities to profit off the backs of lowwage workers i dispute the attempts by free trade proponents to reduce the debate to a choice between free trade and no trade this agreement or no agreement we can do better we can achieve our economic objectives and moral responsibilities through responsible trade and we can and should go back to the drawing board and fix cafta if we want to protect workers and the environment and give the people of the drcafta countries the chance for a better future i urge my colleagues to vote no on cafta so that we can renegotiate this flawed trade agreement"], [0.034564316272735596, 0.9654356837272644, 1, "this evening as i do each tuesday evening that the united states house of representatives is in session i rise on behalf of the 37memberstrong fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition as you walk the halls of congress as you walk the halls of the cannon house office building the longworth house office building and the rayburn house office building it is easy to spot an office that belongs to one of the 37 members of the fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition because you will find this poster as a welcome mat by each door of a blue dog member as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 419 147 820 878 and some change your share of the national debt that is every living man woman and child including the children born today every american citizens share of the national debt is 28 134 as members of the blue dog coalition it is what we call the debt tax debt and that is one tax that cannot go away until this republican congress and this administration gets our nations fiscal house in order last week the president made a big announcement about how the deficit really was not as bad as what his white house had first thought and reported it would be i think the best way to sum up the events of last week can be found in an editorial july 11 2006 from the los angeles times entitled another mission accomplished and i will not read the entire editorial but i think it sets the stage for what we plan the spend the next hour discussing this evening it starts off like this the release of the white house midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets not by a fulldressed presidential dogandpony show but president bush plans to preside today with members of congress and invited guests in attendance by all indications including his own in his weekly radio address last saturday he plans to turn this into a celebration just in time for the fall campaign the editorial from the los angeles times dated july 11 2006 continues this is proof if anyone still needs it that this administration is desperate for something to boast about on mr bushs watch tripledigit budget surpluses have turned into annual tripledigit budget deficits there is no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly dispiriting fact yes the report is expected to project that this years deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last years probably somewhere between 280 and 300 billion versus a 318 billion shortfall in 2005 and it concludes that part of the editorial by saying that is not much to crow about well they are right last week the administration released its midsession review of the budget and after further examination lets take a closer look at what the report actually tells us the report actually tells us that what we have here is another record deficit the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit makes 2006 one of the four largest deficits in our nations history it is hard now to believe that we had a balanced budget in this country from 1998 to 2001 but it did not take this administration and this republicanled congress very long to turn fiscal responsibility into record deficits i 2000 as you can see the largest deficit ever in our nations history occurred in 2004 when the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was 413 billion in red ink in hot checks if you will the year 2003 was the second largest deficit ever in our nations history where for the first time in over 50 years the republicans controlled the white house the house and senate and they gave us the second largest deficit ever in our nations history 378 billion the third largest record deficit ever in our nations history again occurred while the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was in 2005 and it was 318 billion deficit the third largest deficit ever in our nations history then this year the president has a press conference has a grand ceremony and event to announce that the deficit for fiscal year 2006 is only 296 billion the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history i think the editorial in the los angeles times had it right when it said that is not much to crow about the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit as i indicated makes 2006 the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history while this number represents an improvement over the 2005 deficit of 318 billion it still ranks as the fourthlargest deficit ever in our nations history these revised estimates do not account for the extent of our budget problems because they include in the calculation the annual surpluses in social security the first bill i filed as a member of congress when i got here in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund this republican congress refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why because they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund this outofcontrol deficit this outofcontrol debt this reckless spending that we are seeing occurring in our nations capital and the way the republican leadership is running our government and thiscountry in fact when the social security surplus is excluded as it should be the 2006 deficit is not 296 billion it is 473 billion now throughout the evening we are going to be talking more about this

care about your problem and we want to support that extra 100 million that is in this bill and we want to say to people who are confronted with the whole myriad of challenging medical problems such as juvenile diabetes that we want to help and we want to support an additional 250 million for nih we want to say to those 6hat need community health centers where they do not have access to medical care we want to help you with 66 million additional and with liheap with the northeast in particular and with the community services block grants this is a bill that is caring about people i woult suggest to my colleagues on this side that we need to demonstrate with a very strong vote that even though our friends on the other side think it is not enough that it is going to have problems involving reconciliation but this is not a ways and means bill this is not a budget bill this is the peoples bill with peoples programs it is not the reconciliation bill that is another topic and people will have their opportunity to vote on that but i simply want to say that given the resources that we have given the times that we are confronted with that we have done a very responsible job even to the point that members have sacrificed their earmarks they have sacrificed 1 billion worth of earmarks in order to do the things that i outlined before to do more education to do more health research to do more community health centers so this is something that all of us are taking part in trying to serve the needs of the american people as effectively as possible this is a lot of money 142 5 billion and this literally is the peoples bill i want to point out to my friends on the other side that when the republicans became the majority party this bill was 69 billion today it is 142 billion more than double what it was in 1994 that is pretty substantial dedication to education to health research to a whole host of things i would point out in the last 10 years we have increased title i aid to disadvantaged students by 91 percent we have increased special education by 380 percent that is a dramatic increase i think it is great that we and i want to say historically that has had strong bipartisan support that we care about people who have needs i was once an elementary principal in a public school and we did not have any special education program that was the problem of the families today we have billions of dollars spent on these programs that is a credit to america that people do care about each other and it is demonstrated by the support we have for idea with an increase of 380 percent that has been bipartisan we have tripled the federal funding for reading programs i think we are more and more aware that learning to read early in your education experience is vitally important today we are faced within the united states with a dropout rate of over 30 percent that is a terrible waste of human talent one of the things that causes that i think isinadequate reading programs early on we are trying to address that problem we have addressed that problem we are also recognizing in thisbill that the key to a good public education system is a good teacher a good principal a good superintendent caring people so we put in this bill some additional money to recruit and retrain quality public school teachers and principals parents who have worked with principals in the school system know how important that is pell grants we have gone up 64 percent in the last 10 years again we want to help those students who want to get an education who have limited economic resources to get an opportunity to participate in the american dream we have done this with americas historically black colleges we have increased their funding 182 percent that is a dramatic commitment on the part of the federal government all in all i think we as congress can take some pride this is not the back of the bus when you spend 142 billion anything but this is a frontrow seat and we have tried to make sure that every american every american could be in that frontrow seat on the education bus on the health research bus on the labor department programs for job retraining bus i think this is a bill we can take pride in my colleagues on my side since we cannot get any help from our friends on the minority side for whatever reason i have not quite figured that out but i think our members need to strongly support this bill and continue the pride we can take in our accomplishments since we became a majority since 1994 as i have outlined and particularly in the last 10 years this is a bill that is responsible it is a bill that reflects good management of resources it is a bill that we should all support strongly i hope my colleagues on the majority side will come in and vote in a positive way to increase education to increase medical research to increase a whole host of things that will serve our people throughout this land effectively"], [0.9636666178703308,

engineering and mathcollectively stemprograms and i thank him for including a change in the managers amendment stem education is extremely important to our nation because our economic and national security rely on technical and innovative expertise in these fields however i am concerned that this resolution despite the change in the managers amendment still gives premature support to the academic competitiveness councilsacc recommendations which are not due until february 2007 the impetus for the acc sprang from a 2005 government accountability office study on federal stem programs it is my understanding that federal agencies with stem programs have a seat at the acc table however i am concerned that not all agencies have an equal appreciation or understanding of the importance of stem education in improving our national competitiveness and security the national science foundationnsfhas a proven track record of expertise und experience in stem programs we all know that nsf grants have led to truly revolutionary discoveries and technical advances nsffunded researchers have won more than 160 nobel prizes and these pioneers have included the scientists or teams that discovered many of the fundamental particles of matter and decoded the genetics of viruses but many do not know that another essential element in nsfs mission is support for science and engineering education from prek through graduate school and beyond the research that the nsf funds is thoroughly integrated with education to help ensure that there will always be plenty of skilled people available to work in new and emerging scientific engineering and technological fields and plenty of capable teachers to educate the next generation since the nsf has been a leader in stem education for more than 50 years and has established excellent evaluations for all of its programs the acc should give very strong recognition to the role nsf and its education programs play in promoting our economic competitiveness and national security and they should build upon the strengths of the nsf the treasure trove of knowledge the foundation represents should not be overlooked but in fact should be used as a base for the acc recommendations specifically i am concerned that the gostem resolution calls for minimal duplication among stem programs without defining what this means hnd also goes further than the established goals for the acc that are set out in the deficit reduction act for years i have been promoting the math and science partnership programs at the department of educationedand the national science foundation unfortunately because both agencys programs have the same name some have mistakenly thought of these programs as equivalent even though they are in name only and duplicative even though they most definitely are not i am working on legislation to change the name of the nsf program to help avoid future confusion among other differences the nsf program is designed to provide rigorous scientifically based research on what works in stem teacher professional development whereas eds program is designed to implement these ideas on the state level a wide array of teachers scientists and education researchers agree that there is much research needed in the areas addressed by the nsf math and science partnership program yet the presidents budget has called for eliminating new research in the nsf program since there has been significant confusion about different stem programs i am pleased that the acc will focus on coordination and strengthening the federal stem endeavor there is a plethora of stem education programs across many different federal agencies the goal of the gostem resolutionto better coordinate federal stem education efforts 4s needed and is very admirable however i do not want to put the cart before the horse and prefer that congress carefully consider whatever recommendations the acc puts forth before adopting them additionally the gostem resolution calls for consistent standards of evaluation while this is a laudable goal apples cannot be compared to oranges in particular i am concerned that new programs could receive failing grades since they have not had time to demonstrate results will the new smart grants a tremendous tool for bolstering the stem education pipeline receive a results not demonstrated designation as other new programs do in part reviews furthermore we should expect very different outcomes from programs that focus on student learning compared to piograms that focus on graduatelevel research in the physical sciences the tools used to define effective are extremely critical i am uncertain what evaluative methodology the acc will adopt to define effective and therefore am very reluctant to give premature support to the accs recommendations i urge that members pay very close attention to the accs recommendations but please think critically about the evaluative methodology the acc uses in developing its recommendations and recognize and build upon the existing expertise of agencies such as the national science foundation also think very hard about how our actions will

the iraqi army but in the more difficult task of establishing a democratic government we would be far down the road to affecting a paradigm shift in the middle east one which would replace potentates dictators and repression with representative governments transparency and opportunities for both men and women if we were to fail the cost would be incalculable it would be a reaffirmation for many in

israel that are friends of the united states 1000 regardless the situation in iraq is what it is there is no question iraq is a petri dish for terrorists now our main nemesis in iraq is called al

in iraq i truly hope that we have turned a corner with the death of zarqawi and the forming of the government if voter turnout is any indication theiraqi people are eager for democracy they had a higher voter turnout in iraq than we did in virginia for our gubernatorial race but make no mistake what we are trying to do in iraq has been and will continue to be extraordinarily difficult even with zarqawi gone there are many dangerous people who will stop at nothing to stop us i dont support a public date of certain withdrawal from iraq doing so creates an untenable situation for our

moderate arab allies here today but first lets consider what we are and are not voting on today the unitedstates congress cannot stop this sale as this provision would seek to do we simply do not have jurisdiction beyond our shores in fact the sale has already happened and the shareholders will be paid over the next couple of weeks while i appreciate the desire of members to stop the sale the fact is that this language does nothing of the sort im not sure what the goal is the language certainly does not stop the purchase bydubai ports world and even more importantdoes nothing to improve the security of our ports i would argue that this provision does not improve our security but will damage us economically militarily and diplomatically it seems as if we are operating in a factfree zone here the facts are that companies based in many other countries are already managing most of the nations ports will we be seeking to overturn these contracts next the fact is that no american company chose to bid on peninsular and oriental there is only one american company large enough to take on this kind of contract and my understanding is that firm is already at capacity would we simply wish an american ports management company into creation lets talk a little about port security we know that no matter who manages port operations the unitedstates coast guard the unitedstates customs service and unitedstates longshoremen continue to be responsible for port security the checking of cargo and the handling of cargo stephen flynn of the council on foreign relations testified before congress we need to khow whats in the box more than we need to know who is moving them around a container yard so if our concern truly is port security why are we not focusing on supporting that overall effort the fact is that dubai ports world is of course involved with the jebel ali port one of the largest and among the most advanced ports in the world according to the new york times it is the worlds 11th largest port and annually handles more than 7 5 million containers many of them going directly to and from the united states on a number of issues they have cooperated with the unitedstates government to allow for our inspections robert c bonner formerly with customs was quoted in the new york times dubai has acknowledged the absolute importance of securing cargo against terrorists on cargo security we ought to be concerfied about whats being onloaded in foreign ports just as much as we are concerned about whats being offloaded on our shores once a dangerous ship arrives its far too late for concern so if we trust dubai ports world on the first crucial half of a cargo transactionthe loadingwhy would we not trust the company to be involved in unitedstates cargo operations in a strictly management capacity nonetheless the company has moved forward to sell the operations to a unitedstates buyer dpw announced yesterday it has retained credible wellknown legal and financial firms to handle this transaction the company has agreed to abide by a voluntary commitment to hold unitedstates ports separate until the sale is complete and still it seems that its not enough i would ask what more would we have dpw do when will this be dead enough to satisfy the unitedstates congress the action i am sad to say sends exactly the wrong message to the world about the climate for international businesses in the united states it sends the wrong message about our willingness to engage in transactions that create growth and jobs here at home it tells the world that we are an unreliable trading partner while we are sometimes obsessed with the socalled outsourcing of american jobs abroad why are we not similarly concerned about our ability to insource jobs through

washington state one of the peruvian products that have benefited most from the atpa windfall is asparagus which grows in the sandy coastal areas of perunot the mountain highlands where coca is

of frozen asparagus from peru have increased more than twenty times this flood of dutyfree imports has been devastating for american asparagus growers in the major production areas of washington

unitedstates operations and reopened down in peru perhaps if you are not from an asparagus production area in this country you may think this tradeoff is worth it if it results in less narcotics production the unfortunate reality is that this policy has failed according to the white house office of national drug policy coca cultivation in peru has increased to 94 000 acresthe highest level in eight years the international trade commission noted that any impact to narcotics trade from atpa is small and indirect yet the impact to the american asparagus producer is the exact opposite

may consume as we stand here today we continue to see significant progresstoward greater economic opportunity and prosperity across the country more than 2 7 million new jobs have been created over the last 17 months and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5 2 percent the lowest level since september 2001 our economy is strong and it is getting stronger the backbone of a strong economy is a welltrained and highly skilled workforce and it is absolutely critical for workers to have the education and skills necessary to adapt to new opportunities and to move into higher wages federal reserve chairman alan greenspan agreed with this view when he testified before the committee on education and the workforce last year the chairman said we need to increase our efforts to ensure that as many of our citizens as possible have the opportunity to capture the benefits of the changing economy one critical element in creating that opportunity is the provision of rigorous education and ongoing training to all members of our society chairman greenspan this morning testified before congress and talked about the need to do a better job with our education system and better training and retraining of american workers the bill before us the job training improvement act would achieve this objective by strengthening the nations job training system in 1998 congress established a system of onestop career centers aimed at providing one convenient central location to offer job training and related employment services while these reforms have been generally successful the workforce investment act system is still hampered by bureaucracy and duplication that prevents it from being as effective as it could be for workers and their families our bill includes a number of reforms aimed at strengthening our job training system and better engaging the business community to improve job training services our bill includes a number of reforms first requiring state and local workforce investment boards to ensure the job training programs reflect the employment needs in local areas secondly allowing training for currently employed workers so employees can upgrade their skills and avoid layoffs third encouraging the highest caliber providers including community colleges to offer training through the onestop system and leveraging other public and private resources to increase training and opportunities the bill also includes other important reforms first it consolidates the three adult wia training programs giving states and local communities greater flexibility and enabling more job seekers to be served with no reduction in services in addition it targets 70 percent of the youth grant funds to outofschool youth an underserved population that faces significant challenges in finding meaningful employment the bill includes a proposal passed by the house last year introduced by the gentleman from nevada to create personal reemployment accounts of up to 3 000 to help unemployed americans purchase job train ing and other employmentrelated services such as child care transportation services and housing assistance giving them the flexibility they need in order to gain meaningful employment in addition it includes the presidents community college proposal to strengthen the partnership between local businesses community colleges and the local onestop delivery system later today we will consider an amendment from my colleague from virginia to strip the faithbased provisions from this bill an amendment that would deny faithbased providers their rights under the historic 1964 civil rights act when we considered this bill in committee we twice rejected it on a bipartisan basis and i urge all members to vote against it today the 1964 civil rights act made clear that when faithbased groups hire employees on a religious basis it can exercise the groups civil rights liberties and not discriminate under federal law in 1987 the supreme court unanimously upheld this right as my colleagues can see from the chart that i have next to me former president bill clinton signed four laws allowing faithbased groups to staff on a religious basis when they receive those federal funds those four laws are the 1996 welfare reform law the 1998 community services block grant act the 2000 community renewal tax relief act and the 2000 substance abuse and mental health services administration act all allowing faithbased providers to preserve their rights under the 1964 civil rights act our nations faithbased institutions have a proven track record in meeting the training and counseling needs of our citizens why would we want to deny them the opportunity to help in federal job training efforts president bush repeated this call to empower faithbased providers both during his state of the union address and again yesterday i can think of no better place to start than to protect the rights of faithbased groups who are willing to lend a helping hand in providing job training and other critical social services to the most needy of our citizens i want to thank the gentleman from california for his work in putting this bill together a bill that is supported by a broad and diverse coalition of groups including the unitedstates chamber of commerce the national association of counties the national association of workforce boards the national workforce association the coalition to preserve religious freedom and the salvation army amongst others we are part of a dynamic economy that is constantly creating new and different types of jobs so the knowledge and skills of each job seeker is absolutely critical in determining their succesg or failure if we are going to help them succeed then strengthening our job training programs is essential the bill i believe accomplishes that goal unfortunately the only plan that my colleagues on the other side have put forward to address the needs of american workers is the status quo their plan fails to reduce duplication and inefficiency it fails to give states and local communities more flexibility and it fails to take advantage of the positive role that faithbased institutions play in our communities and the success they have in providing critical social services to those most in need the status quo is no plan at all i ask my colleagues to support the underlying bill i reserve

chairman mr coble in developing this bill which will focus on improving the due process and effectiveness in atf enforcement of federal gun laws and regulations currently as many as 98 percent of violations cited by atf against gun dealers result in nothing more than a letter of reprimand or meeting with atf officials at their office backed by some threats of revocation there are complaints on the one hand that the enforcement system treats federal firearms licensees unfairly by focusing too much on minor technical violations with threats of revocation so on the occasional though rare occasion where the gun dealers license is actually revoked for what is perceived to be a minor violation it generates perceptions of unfairness and breeds disrespect of the regulatory process if a violation is challenged the system perpetuates a further appearance of unfairness by using atf employees responsible to their supervisors to decide the case on the other hand there are complaints that atf is unable to effectively license the licensees because the only available sanction is revocation and licensees note they are unlikely to be revoked for anything more than a serious violation therefore they can be casual with a lesser violation since they are unlikely to receive anything less than a warning"], [0.03220087289810181, 0.5322008728981018, 1, "of the problems here is this is

much about who we are as kansans and who we are as americans discrimination and slavery are an unfortunate part of our countrys history black americans suffered greatly and many fought and died to obtain their freedom the struggle between proslavery forces and abolitionists was fought across the country and significant battles took place in my home state of kansas during the 1850s the outcome of bleeding kansas was a free state in the heart of an expanding nation that offered hope and opportunity to former slaves while the end of the civil war brought with it expectations that african americans would finally enjoy the rights described in our founding documents many rights obtained were largely stripped away by the end of the reconstruction period many recognized the sacrifice that kansas had made to become a free state ex slaves left the south and ventured out to the vast prairies of kansas in search of freedom and opportunity the destination for many of these individuals was nicodemus founded in 1877 by six african american men nicodemus was formed as a community specifically for african americans at a time when prejudice and oppression were still common nicodemus offered african americans a place to own their own land to make a living farming and to prosper in a jurisdiction allowing self government the young community of nicodemus grew and prospered during the 1880s as a result of the ingenuity of black entrepreneurs and the dedication and commitment of black farmers though many african americans in the south were denied an education nicodemus established schools and educated the towns children since the bustling activity and growth of the 1880s nicodemus has had its ups and downs yet it today remains a community of african americans and a testament to the human desire for freedom nicodemus is the only remaining western town established by emancipated slaves during the reconstruction period and it is critical that its history not be lost on november 12

across the ocean to economies for example france where they did not address the social security problem the social security challenge that they have there and because now the cost of those senior survivor benefits are so high in france their economy is crumbling under the weight of those costs in fact no matter what solution we have we depend on growth in this economy to fund the transition and so we have to have two things we have to have a plan to save and strengthen social security for our children it is safe for todays seniors but for our children to make it safe and secure and solvent for them and we need a growing economy so that they can have those good jobs so that they can build the personal accounts while they meet the social security needs for those that were in the

purposes and this would have a very injurious effect on the customers of explosives in my state costing a tremendous amount of money as i say the president has requested this for the last 2 years in

and certainly from my standpoint to make the point that this is an inappropriate way to try to fund the functions of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and making the request and not knowing that it probably would not be approved by the congress makes a huge hole in our bill the chairman is putting it into the bill at a much lower level and i do not know whether he anticipated this particular action and i am not going to speak for him on that but this i think demonstrates to the administration that this kind of a tactic knowing that the administration relying on the fund and the congress not approving it and then have to take the money out of some other account we are just not going to continue do that so by striking it i hope that what results is that there is a hole in batfs budget at the end of the year and making the point that this is probably not a good idea for the administration to do if they in fact want all of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearm
