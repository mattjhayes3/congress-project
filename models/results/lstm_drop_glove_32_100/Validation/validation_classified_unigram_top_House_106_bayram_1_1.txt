and his dedication as reflected in this conference report to meeting the needs of the men and women who produce the intelligence on which policy makers and military commanders rely as adopted by the house the intelligence authorization was onetenth of one percent above the presidents request this conference report is below the house bill and twotenths of one percent below the request the primary reason for the reduction is that some of the items authorized in the house bill were funded several months ago in a supplemental appropriations measure the conference report as did the supplemental appropriation bill supports the transformation initiative that the director of the national security agency general michael hayden has begun to implement it is critical to the security of the united states that nsa be modernized general hayden has developed a plan which the committee generally supports the modernization of nsa will not succeed however without the sustained visible support of the most senior leaders of the department of defense and the intelligence community to date in terms of resource allocation i have not seen evidence that the rebuilding of nsa is a top priority of the executive branch i hope that this changes next year one of the shortcomings in the intelligence community in my view is that there is too much emphasis on collection and not enough on making sure that which is collected can be used if it were possible to collect only important information this imbalance would be inconsequential our national technical means however collect volumes of information that must be analyzed to identify what is important put in a usable form and sent to those who need it last year congress made clear its expectation that the new future imagery architecture fia would be an adequate balance between collection activities and tped or tasking processing exploitation and dissemination activities congress was clear in the description of the consequences that would flow from an executive branch decision not to make tped investments sufficient to utilize fully the collection capabilities of fia as the classified annex to this conference report makes clear the resolve of congress on this issue has not changed the conference agreement amends the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa and the criminal code in ways that deserve some comment among other things the fisa amendments make clear that in making a probable cause determination that a target wasan agent of a foreign power the court may consider past activities of the target i am advised that the targets past activities have regularly been part of a probable cause determination in this respect the amendment represents a codification of current practice there have been suggestions that the amendment is needed to ensure that information once excluded from the probable cause determination merely because it was dated will now be considered i believe that this is an incorrect interpretation of both the current practice and the effect of the amendment those facts which are relevant to determining the probability that a target is currently an agent of a foreign power should be considered those facts that are irrelevant regardless of whether they are fresh or stale should not be considered section 304 makes the unauthorized disclosure of properly classified information acquired by a person who has or had authorized access to the information a felony subject to 3 years imprisonment when the disclosure is made willingly and knowingly to aperson known not to have authorized access i disapprove of the practice by which some individuals entrusted with access to classified information leak that information to unauthorized recipients including members of the media i share the frustration of those who open their daily newspapers only to see in print some of the most sensitive information in our governments possession i have however grave concerns about the reach and the scope of section 304 there are currently a variety of statutory and administrative prohibitions on the authorized disclosure of classified information the fact that more leakers are not punished is not and i stress is not the result of too few prohibitions it is the result of the great difficulty inherent in identifying the leakers section 304 adds another prohibition unwisely in my judgment it will not make it easier to identify the source of a leak before our conference began the gentleman from florida mr goss and i received a letter from the chairman and ranking member of the committee on the judiciary urging the rejection of this provision in their letter the gentleman from illinois and the gentleman from michigan noted that by making all leaks subject to criminal penalties the provision has profound first amendment implications and goes to the very heart of the ability of the public to remain informed about matters of critical public interest which often relate to governmental misdeeds in conference i offered an amendment to narrow the definition of classified information under section 304 to make sure that only leaks of information of substantial sensitivity would be punished under this provision other leaks would continue to be punishable under other statutes or administrative procedures although my amendment was approved by the house conferees the senate rejected it i hope that in the next congress the committee on the judiciary in whose jurisdiction the issues raised by section 304 properly reside will carefully examine the provision last years intelligence authorization act established a commission to examine the judicial review questions raised by the foreign narcotics kingpin designation act the commission was given one year from the date of enactment to review the current judicial regulatory and administrative authorities under which the united states blocks assets of foreign persons and to provide a detailed constitutional examination and evaluation of remedies available to united states persons affected by the blocking of assets of foreign persons i had hoped that the commission might have completed its work in less than a year because of the great importance i attach to the resolution of the due process concerns raised by the drug kingpin legislation although it now appears the commission will need all of the time allocated

american people and especially to married people had i been invited to the conference that is after the speaker appointed me i would have been able to bring to that conference a message from the president of the united states because i was authorized to say that even though the president thought that there was a better way to target the relief for married couples he recognized that those in the majority had this overwhelming compulsion to reward those people that god has already rewarded with additional wealth but he had authorized me to tell the conferees had i been told where the meeting was that he was willing to go along in the spirit of bipartisanship with the republican majority marriage penalty bill if only they would consider and attach to that some relief for the older folks that cannot afford to purchase their prescription drugs the chairman said that is wrong that we should not participate in youscratchmybackandiscratchyours well we are politicians and if my republican colleagues have such an overwhelming concern for the taxpayers that they are talking about giving back close to 1 trillion let us be honest with the taxpayers the republican majority is not giving them back anything not 1 red cent what they are doing and they should be doing with us is revising the tax system to give them some relief they are not sending americans a refundable tax check as every one of the speakers implied they are just reducing their tax burdens and we would want to join in that effort we cannot have bipartisan bills by closing up the conference and having it from room to room so that the minority cannot participate we cannot have bipartisan legislation unless my republican colleagues reach out and ask the white house what can be accommodated unless they talk with the democratic members on the committee and the leadership and then reach an agreement that is the beautiful thing about this great country and what used to be this great house of representatives is that no one comes here with all of the answers just being in the majority does not mean that they are brighter than the rest of us just being elected does not mean they have all of the answers it means that they reach out they discuss the problems together and they come up with not what is best for their convention in philadelphia but what is best for the people of the united states of america it is no great genius if they can count that they have 218 votes and that they have some democrats that will vote with them from time to time to pass bills they have passed any number of bills knowing that they are not going to become law how does that make them a better legislator how do they go to a convention and say i passed it and they did not support it where they really have leadership is if they are able to say i had some great ideas i was able to persuadethe house and the president of the united states to buy these ideas and together yes together we did not just pass bills but we made law we want to do it with them there is not an issue that they brought up that we do not want to cooperate with them but they just cannot give us slivers of tax relief and forget that we have a responsibility not only to relieve the tax burden of the taxpayers but also to make certain that the social security system is there when they are eligible for it we have a responsibility not just to give access to health care under medicare but to make certain that an older person can afford to get their prescriptions when the doctors say they need it we have to reduce the tax burden on our people but we also have a responsibility to pay down the federal debt that is 6 trillion that means that every year we are paying billions of dollars in interest we ought to relieve the next generation of that burden what i am saying is it is no profile in courageto come here and pass bills especially when they have been promised a veto what is courageous is to be able to say i want to sit down with these democrats there are enough differences between our parties to fight about in november but tax relief for the married couples tax relief for estates tax relief for couples with minimum wage relief to be able to get affordable drugs protection of social security and protection of medicare they are not democratic issues these are american issues we cannot tackle these problems and we cannot bring solutions to those problems by going to democratic caucuses or going off to our conventions saying we fought off those people and the other side cannot go to philadelphia and talk about all the bills that they have passed unless they can tell the voters that they have given them relief because they have worked it out with democrats and with the president so here we are once again i suspect there will be other bills on their way to philadelphia where they will be there trying to say if one is appointed to a conference would they be kind enough gentle enough courteous enough to allow the democrats to attend the conference it is a part of the house rules are they so afraid of a different opinion are they so afraid to engage are they so committed not to do anything to provide decent legislation that the president may sign are they so embeddedwith the concept that they do not want to touch prescription drugs that even when the president sends a national message they want their bill take care of american old folks take care of our sick and to make certain that when we leave here that we can go to california we can go to philadelphia we can go to our conventions and say that we differ and that is what makes america great that is what makes this congress great but do not hold the older folks hostage giving them slivers of proposed tax givebacks when they know that they are not talking about anything that they intend to become law it is not too late for us to work together we have had enough of the fighting why can we not go to philadelphia

for yielding me this time i concur in the ranking members remarks and the subcommittee chairmans remarks concerning this bill in return i want to just thank her for her leadership on this issue it is a very important matter frankly private mortgages insurance is a major basis to provide for lower interest rates and affordable housing for many many homeowners that otherwise would not be able to acquire the loan they need to purchase a home and so keeping this particular product in place is enormously important but also we need to be vigilant to make certain that the individual homeowner that has such a loan with private mortgage insurance is in fact being treated fairly in terms of this insurance and given the right to cancellation and to exercise the option to drop such insurance once the loantovalue ratio of down payment and equity has been exceeded that is exactly what the basic law did that was en acted in fact it was brought to our attention by as has been pointed out the gentleman from utah who has had an active interest in this as a consumer and as a representative from utah what we have before us today of course is the technical corrections i know that the members of congress would be surprised to learn that we do not write perfect laws that from time to time we have to go back and make some modifications to clarify intent and to eliminate ambiguity that is really what has happened in this case with congress coming back to this law which we passed a couple of years ago to try and clear up some of the misunderstandings this is really congress at its best or this house at its best trying to deal with those ambiguities or dealing with some of the issues this has been done in such a way as to provide for a common sense policy path that will in fact ensure that the rights to exercise and cancel this insurance and i might comment to my colleagues that these payments could be anywhere from 50 to 100 difference a month in terms of what the homeowner actually pays in terms of mortgage insurance this is no small matter for those that might be canceling such insurance to have the benefit of making this savings this permits them to repair their credit it permits them at midpoint to avoid this type of insurance when it is not necessary and we all know that translates into homeownership it translates into more americans being able to take advantage of the american dream of homeownership really i think that our committee has prided itself in terms of obtaining and being part of the goal that had been enunciated by this administration and for others for many years and that is obtaining one of the highest rates of homeownership in our history today of course we are in the high60 range in terms of homeownership some states because of lower costs are doing much better such as my state of minnesota others are challenged because of the high cost of housing and homeownership in those states but nevertheless this bill will help maintain and provide the stability provide the predictability and provide the cheaper mortgage insurance and these important tools which are making it possible to obtain the dream of homeownership in this country i commend this bill to my colleagues i rise in support of h r 3637 the pm technical corrections and clarification act as one of the architects of the recent law that affords people the right to stop paying for costly private mortgage insurance when they no longer need it i am pleased that we are finally moving this technical corrections bill that will benefit consumers and the industry i joined my colleagues in cosponsoring this needed private mortgage insurance technical corrections and clarification act so that we can clarify some meanings and make corrections to terms rights for consumers and responsibilities for mortgage lenders under the homeowners protection act of 1998 we worked together then as we did today with interested consumer and mortgage industry groups to come up with a bill that worked to the benefit of all parties unfortunately when we passed the homeowners protection act we were unable to prevail on one issue and that was to actually have a regulator to work out some of the details of the statute and the underlying policy that has left us with the need to clarify some smaller points in the statute as is being proposed in this bill before the house of representatives today this point in highlighted by provisions such as those in section 6 where we are coming back to define what the term refinanced means that clearly is a definition that the federal reserve board or the department of housing and urban development could have handled without further congressional action there are more meaningful and key clarifications contained in h r 3637 for example the bill h r 3637 will clarify that pmi cancellation rights exist not only on the cancellation date but on any later date as well so long as the borrower meets all the other cancellation requirements including being current on loan payments this was clearly our intent and is a needed fix resolved in this measure h r 3637 also will make clear that a good payment history should be calculated on the later of the cancellation date or the date the borrower requests cancellation in this way the borrower cannot be frozen in a category of not having a good payment history at the first cancellation date and therefore never eligible for cancellation even if he or she had repaired and improved their payment history the bill eases lenders burdens by assuring a timely yet sensible termination time of the first day of the following month after a borrower become current this change eliminates the need for a lender to check and cancel pmi every day of the month following a consumers potential eligibility it also clarifies that cancellationlterminationrights are based on most recent amortization schedule for adjustable rate mortgages and other products where the amortization schedule may change over the course of a loans life two other important technical corrections include assuring that the goal post cannot continually be shifted by changing a currently undefined midpoint h r 3637 will clarify that the midpoint is the halfway point between the first date of the loan and the last day of the period over which the loan is scheduled to be amortized finally our bill also makes clear that the appraised value at the time of the refinancing and not the value at original purchase should be is used to determine the loan to value ratio and cancellation termination rights i want to express my thanks to my democratic and republican colleagues who have all worked together to bring this technical corrections bill before the house today and i urge other

as time passes all the defects and shortcomings of the bill in spite of the efforts of the subcommittee to try to rationalize its actions serious problems are very apparent in this bill i would just point out the serious shortfall in terms of funding for housing based on obviously cooked numbers apparently from the committees and from the committee on the budget and arguable numbers from the administration some of which i agree and disagree with within this bill there is 945m nearly 1 billion dollars less than in 1999 for housing it is like the house is participating in a continued sham in terms of the budget act the fact of the matter is that the public is rejecting the policy path that has been laid out by the congress but the majority insists on getting up and passing bills that seriously underfund programs and seriously underfund housing this is almost a billion dollars less than what was actually funded last year based on trying to use standardized numbers several billion dollars less than the administration has requested i would say looking at what the need is that the serious problems of the past have now turned into a crisis with regards to housing we cannot continue to use housing as the honey pot to take money out and spread it around to programs that have more popular support in my community in minnesota we have about a 1 percent vacancy rate in fact vouchers that are often provided as an answer very often do not work and will not work so even though all the facts change all the circumstances change the congress acts as if in 1999 is still on a 1997 budget rationale funds are being split off for various purposes here for an 800b in tax breaks for pentagon spending for other matters and yet we do not respond to the various and the deep needs of the low income people in our communities and their housing crisis the homeless funds are cut lead paint abatement funding cut community development housing funds those of the least powerful in our society are shortchanged i urge my colleagues to reject this bill i hope we could get to work and be in reality rather than remain in a state of denial regard the needs of people for shelter in safe sanitary housing once again the gop leadership is relying upon gimmicks to hide their fiscal year 2000 appropriations process train wreck by turning their backs on funding needs for important people programs and failing to invest in important social housing and community development programs the republicans have all but ensured a major confrontation this fall with congressional democrats and the administration the rush to provide tax cuts for special interests and the wealthy have clouded the need to address social program funding realities unfortunately the vahud appropriation bill started out on a sour note with the republican budget blueprint earlier this year adding salt to the wounds the gop majority appropriators chose to lay out unrealistic laborhhseducation 302 b allocations in order to spare from reductions popular defense spending military pork projects and nasa programs all of these increases are provided at the extreme cost of housing and development programs and environmental protection such irresponsible gop policies will put in place a convoluted process of shifting money into popular programs to attract votes and comply with the spending caps at the expense of the powerless in our society sadly this vahud bill continues to force hud to draw the short straw for housing and community development programs and that will impact real people through the loss of jobs and affordable housing there are few improvements to mention though i am pleased that there is finally some commitment to restore 10 million in funding to the fema emergency food and shelter program a program that i have worked with chairman walsh in the past to increase funding however the bill we will vote upon this week continues the theme of the past few years making housing a principal wellspring for spending increases elsewhere and tax cuts for special interests and the wealthy hud estimates that in minnesota we will lose over 23 million jeopardizing 1 600 jobs and almost 2 400 units of housing for lowincome families if this bill were enacted the cuts in hopwa housing for persons with aids and mckinney homeless assistance funds would result in 138 homeless and persons with aids not being served the st paul public housing authority one of the nations best accurately explains the consequence further cuts in public housing funds will jeopardize our safe affordable and quality public housing because cuts in operating subsidies will slow responses to repairs cut key staff who screen applicants and generally impair their ability to apply for and comply with federal programs the lack of commitment and cuts that this vahud bill would deliver will result in fewer resident services and will mean less ability to deter criminal activity and other community concerns unfortunately the vahud appropriations bill cuts close to a billion dollars in funds from huds budget last year and is some 3 billion below the administrations request despite trying to hide the cuts by spreading the pain around it is clear that housing and community development will suffer under this billan atrophy by design this atrophy has also hit successful programs like the neighborhood reinvestment corporation which faces a 10 million cut in this bill further while the overall vahud bill has lost some of the emergency spending gimmicks the gop majority appropriators have chosen instead to gouge ever deeper in the laborhhseducation funds in order to spare the popular veterans and nasa programs predictably housing and community programs have been left with cuts to the community development block grant cdbg and even the mckinney homeless assistance programs housing for persons with aids public housing and the list goes on no new housing assistance despite the commitments to authorize 100 000 new vouchers made in the 1999 budget authorization this is a warped policy especially at a time when millions of people are on waiting lists for housing are on the streets and according to a department of housing study deems 5 3 million families have worst case housing needs this situation is frankly dire the circumstances and facts change the federal budget is in better shape but lowincome housing needs have exploded yet the funding response ignores the facts the real need of our communities which should be addressed by this bill is in preserving our federally assisted housing from the optout or prepayment phenomenon by matching state programs to keep buildings affordable or marking up market rents so landlords stay with our successful programs but how will we be able to move forward for the future with preservation efforts when this bill does not squarely address the real housing needs of this country with what we have now we are already sliding backward and the passage of the vahud bill this week is like throwing a drowning person an anvil this is not acceptable policy for housing our people or creating the economic opportunities that will help them move forward in tandem with their communities and neighborhoods this appropriation process and budget blueprint is wholly inadequate if we are going to cut spending it must be based on equal sharing of the burden not loading all the cuts on the backs of lowincome americans and the programs which serve them certainly this policy path and bill should be rejected to add insult to injury this spending measure makes no effort to reconcile the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars of rescinded section 8 moneys that have been usurped for emergency spending this year and the last this year for example we lost 350 million in section 8 that is made up if at all on the backs of other critical housing programs like the cdbg block grant which serves low and moderateincome folks in cities across the country while the committee may claim inadequate appropriation authority under the budget the fact is that there are 215 earmarks spending money on special interest projects the conclusion of this bill is to deny funding for housing and other needs but to buy off votes to pass it with projects and earmarked funds i am concerned regarding the cut in funding for the community development financial institutions cdfi fund as the sponsor of the bill to maintain and improve the cdfi fund which has been reported by the banking committee i think it would be more appropriate to keep the funding for the program at 95 million instead of what the committee provided through this bill a reduction of 25 million this underfunding is even more serious if we are to be able to have the running room to adequately fund the prime program that the banking committee has also reported out"], [0.09762054681777954, 0.9023794531822205, 1, "last thursday the house very wisely

the total and which would in essence be a poster child for burden sharing when i got up to the floor as did many of my colleagues we talked about genocide and ethnic cleansing and said that it was important for nato to have a presence in kosova in order to prevent ethnic cleansing today in the front page of the washington post there is unfortunately an article which says kosovo killings called a massacre and i just wanted to read some of the article and then ask to have the entire article put into the record but the article starts off by saying an independent forensic report into the killings of 40 ethnic albanians in the kosovo village of racak in january has found that the victims were unarmed civilians executed in an organized massacre some of them forced to kneel before being sprayed with bullets according to western sources familiar with the report the findings by finnish forensic experts set to be released wednesday in pristina the kosovo capital contradicts claims by officials of the serb led yugoslav government that the dead were armed ethnic albanian separatists or civilians accidentally caught in a crossfire between government security forces and separatist rebels western officials have blamed the killings on government police it has been apparent for many years now but especially during the past several months that ethnic cleansing and genocide has been going on in kosova and by the way i say kosova because that is the way 92 percent of the people who live there who are ethnic albanians pronounce it they pronounce it kosova and in my estimation if that is what the people who live there call their land that is what i call it we have said that ethnic cleansing and genocide has been going on and that is wliy it is just so important for nato to be there people who say that it is not in our vital interests i would argue that it is in our vital interests to stop genocide and also in the unitedstates vital interest to prevent a larger outbreak of the war which would surely if given a chance suck in many neighboring countries including the potential to suck in nato allies of turkey and greece and bulgaria and other countries as well and so that

china i was taken away by the secret police for interrogation on many details related to our student association and the activities of other chinese democratic groups and organizations for several days they tried to force me to do things i did not want to do including signing a confession letter on the fifth day i was given 20 minutes to pack my luggage and say goodbye to my scared parents and was forced into hong kong still the secret police told me they had treated me leniently because i am married to an american he had contacted his congressional representative the gentlewoman from ohio in order to protect me the government told me i must cooperate with them afterwards and do what they wanted me to do if i ever wanted to return home to visit my parents again last september i learned my father had a 102 degree fever for several days and was diagnosed with cancer i decided to take a trip back home immediately however about 20 police stopped me at the shanghai international airport they searched my luggage and would not let me make phone calls or even go to the bathroom in the airport i asked them to respect the united nations universal declaration of human rights which the chinese president had just signed and let me go visit my ill father but my plea was simply ignored i was put on the airplane back to tokyo even though they knew that the hospital had sent us a critical condition notice which stated that my father could die any minute in tokyo i repeatedly appealed to the chinese authorities to allow me into china for basic humanitarian reasons but to no avail up until this day i still have not been able to visit my poor father for a long time she says i have viewed america its people and its government as the ones who hold the moral flags high who would be willing to help and sometimes sacrifice themselves for the people in the rest of the world to gain their basic human rights and dignity and for humanitarian reasons now for this permanent normal trade status as well as admission to the wto the world trade organization i wish you could prove that again i wish you could answer this question correctly is business more important than the principles we live by do we care about the human rights condition of more than 1 2 billion human lives in the past the annual congressional conditional renewal of most favored nation to china was able to provide some leverage for chinese human rights improvement such as the release of some political prisoners and the relaxation of the political atmosphere within china unfortunately as you all know without the attachment of the human rights improvement conditions in china have deteriorated in the last few years at this point i would like to insert the remainder of this letter in the record and i will come to the floor again to read the conclusion the chinese communist government has not and will not learn democracy and respect human dignity from the pntr they would only take its passage as an advantage and signal that it is ok to continue their miserable poor record on human rights and democracy but if america could care less about people far away look at what they have done to falun gong members and taiwan recently i hope you do realize that the pntr would do no more benefit for american workers especially those in the trade unions where people earn a living wage with health and retirement benefits in china there are no real workers unions thus it puts american workers in a much more disadvantaged position to compete with let me stress i wish that america will protect the human rights of its own people furthermore america should help to protect the human rights of its own people by helping to protect the human rights of the people in the other countries only when these countries have human rights and democracy shall the world be in peace and i wish we could hold morality above money but not the other way around and i wish none of us including our democratic government would have to kneel in front of a dictatorial government for money or mercy or the human rights we deserve to have and finally with all of your conscience and help i wish that in the near future i would be able to visit my ill father in my homeland thank you all sincerely"], [0.10097134113311768, 0.8990286588668823, 1, "i enjoyed listening to my colleague from georgia who was just at the microphone talking about how the republicans are working on an agenda and one of the parts of their best program was saving social security i also note with interest that right after the republicans passed their 3 trillion tax bill the wall street journal wrote that in order to pay for it they are going to have to dip into social security and take 25 billion out of social security to pay for this tax bill the fact of the matter is that america is enjoying the greatest economy in the history of our country the longest economic recovery since the second world war we have more people working more people are buying houses more people are entering the workforce from people who historically have not been able to find a place in our economy than any time in the country and we have had relatively low interest rates all of that has happened since the 1993 economic program of the clintongore administration when this congress took a courageous vote but was only able to pass it with democratic members of the house and senate not a single republican voted for that when we voted for that and the clintongore plan passed they said that everything was going to go downhill that interest rates were going to soar that people were going to be unemployed the economy is going in the tank the dow is going to crasjh none of that has come to pass over the last 8 years it has taken us 20 years to get out of the hole that ronald reagans tax cuts put us in in 1981 in 1981 we had a huge tax cut that we could not afford it was sort of like increasing your kids allowance after you have been unemployed it sounds good but it does not make a lot of sense for 20 years we have tried to dig our way out of that hole for the first time we are now looking at surpluses and we are looking at surpluses over the coming years but what the republicans are asking us to do is to take all that economic prosperity to take those low interest rates to take that job creation to take that employment to take those new homes and roll the dice with those with the tax bill that is 800 billion in the first 10 years and then goes to 3 trillion in the second 10 years now in order to do that they tell you that everything is going to stay the same over the next 15 years you have to believe that nothing is going to change in a negative fashion over the next 15 years but if you go back to the wall street journal we already see that the republicans are starting to think of ways of breaking the current budget caps because they cannot live within them but the surplus that they want to give people back in tax cuts is predicated upon the fact that those budget caps will not only be enforced at their current levels they will be reduced so there will be less spending and yet the republicans are trying to figure out ways to increase the spending this year because they cannot live under the cap i think the american people are on to something when we look at all of the data what the american people are saying is we know we have a 5 trillion debt that has been run up over the past history of this country now the sun is shining on our economy and people are working and they are buying houses and taxes are being generated why do we not pay down the debt why do we not save that 150 billion in interest why do we not take that interest and apply it to the debt just like a family would if they had a windfall you would pay off the mastercard you would pay off the visa bill you would try to get out of debt and the interest you save you might use to buy your kids some clothes or you might use for whatever purposes you want and the interest you save on low interest rates would be applied to your family income you would be able to refinance your home that so many millions of americans already have under this economic recovery for all of this we are going to pass a 3 trillion tax bill that the washington post tells usmainly benefitsrelatively few people the wealthiest people in the country get most of that tax cut but whatdoes it put at risk it puts at risk every familys wellbeing because even alan greenspan said that if he had his way he would not cut taxes he would not increase spending he would just take the savings we are making now in the surplus and apply it to the debt and let the surpluses continue to run because he knows that not every day is going to be a sunny day for the american economy the clouds are going to come the economic cycles are going to reoccur and we are going to have some bad times what better to go into bad times with than a little bit of extra in your savings account to tide you over just like a family does that is what a nation has to do we are going to have some options over tomorrow and the next day we can decide whether we are going to be prudent whether we are going to take care of this economic recovery whether we are going to allow it to last longer so more people can participate or whether we are going to pick up those dice and just roll them out there on the crap table and see whether we can put it all at risk i vote to believe i vote to believe that we ought to be prudent that we ought not to take social security and medicare and the education of our children and put it at risk because understand if you take the republican proposal and you take a 3 trillion tax cut there is no money for anything else that is why again as the wall street journal points out they are already trying to play shenanigans with the spending programs to hide spending they are already prepared to go in and take 25 billion out of a social security trust fund that is already broke that is how they finance their tax cut i do not think that is a program that american families want to endorse"],

issue in making a final decision we are all fully aware of the explosion in costs for prescription drugs in recent years this phenomenon has in part been linked to the rapid proliferation of the number of new drugs that have become available in the past decade we are currently enjoying a period of revolutionary advances in the fields of medicine and medical technology yet at the same time a significant portion of our elderly population is unable to benefit from these new advances due to the high costs that are associated with them this is ironic when one realizes that senior citizens are the primary group that these new advances are targeting one fact that has become increasingly apparent is that medicare is woefully inadequate in meeting the medical needs of todays senior citizens when medicare was created in 1965 outpatient prescription drugs were simply not a major component of health care for this reason medicare did not provide coverage for selfadministered medicine todays health care environment is vastly different from that of 1965 the majority of care is now provided in an outpatient setting and dozens of new prescription drugs enter the market every year to treat the common ailments of the elderly including cancer heart disease arthritis and osteoporosis but while the health care environment has made remarkable progress since 1965 medicare has stood in place consequently most of my colleagues and i have heard from constituents who are now facing the dilemma of paying for these expensive new drugs while living on a fixed income the individual who is forced to choose between food and medicine is no exaggeration it is an all too common occurrence across the country the high cost of prescription drugs have become a threat to the retirement security of our nations senior citizens it is for this reason that i am pleased to see that the ways and means committee has completed its work on a proposal to provide prescription drug coverage for medicare beneficiaries what concerns me however is the process by which this measure was brought to the full house for consideration the decision to add prescription drug coverage will result in the greatest change in the medicare program since its creation this is not something that should be done lightly or in haste given that i have serious reservations about bringing such major policychanging legislation to the floor for final passage less than 3 weeks after it was introduced with that said i would like to comment on the positive points of the bill as well as to highlight some of my specific concerns with the legislation in my view any proposal to offer prescription drug coverage under medicare needs to contain the following characteristics to be voluntary to have universal eligibility under medicare contain stoploss protections to guard against catastrophic expenses offer choices in the type of coverage provided and remain a good value over time the proposal outlined in h r 4680 clearly meets these requirements it differs from the administrations proposal in that it defines the scope of its stoploss protections and ties its benefits to medical inflation and the actual costs of the drugs rather than the consumer price index h r 4680 also avoids a onesizefitsall governmentimposed solution by offering senior citizens a choice in the types of plans in which to enroll in doing this the government will guarantee that at least two plans will be available in every area of the country moreover the proposal fully funds all costs for those enrollees below 135 of the poverty rate and partially funds the costs of those up to 150 of the poverty rate in addition this legislation also establishes a new agency the medicare benefit administration to oversee the implementation of the plans it further creates an office of beneficiary assistance and medicare ombudsman to serve as a patient advocate and mandates the establishment of a policy advisory board much like those for the irs and social security administration as i mentioned i do have some reservations about certain aspects of this bill the first of these is the matter of adverse selection simply put this is the condition whereby most seniors in good health avoid signing up for a plan leaving the majority of enrollees coming from the sickest segment of the population if this were to occur the premium and deductibles would have to be far higher than presently outlined the bills sponsors reply that by covering part or all of the costs of those with incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty level the proposal would ensure that there would be an adequate base of healthy seniors to offset the portion in greatest need of the benefit this remains to be seen and i believe that this particular aspect of the plan needs to be monitored closely i am also concerned about the viability of private insurers underwriting plans in areas where it is not profitable for them to do so recent experience with medicare choice plans in my district have borne out this concern in such cases the government would step in as the insurer of last resort assuming a share of the risk as well as subsidizing the cost of offering service in a rural area my chief concern with this is that it has the potential to become a costly venture for the government where the private insurers deliberately hold out in order to secure a greater level of government funding in spite of these concerns i firmly believe that this legislation is an important first step in providing a benefit to our senior citizens which is long overdue the prescription drugs situation will not change on its own in the future rather we will continue to see a flood of new revolutionary products hitting the market however there is a price to pay for innovation as our recent experience has shown in accepting this it is important that we do not continue to fall into the trap in which we presently find ourselveshaving new products that are too expensive for their target audience this bill is the first step towards correcting this problem for that reason despite my stated reservations i intend to give it my qualified support it is my hope that my concerns will be addressed in a future housesenate conference on this issue should this not be the case i will reconsider my future support when the final compromise language comes before the house regardless of the final outcome i will not support any legislation which under the claim of reducing drug prices denies doctors the ability to prescribe those medicines which they deem best for their patients simply to save money this is exactly what has happened to the governmentrun systems in the united kingdom and canada the relationship between the doctor and patient is sacred and should not be tread uponespecially by any government bureaucrat this issue is too serious for party politics and as i stated at the outset i urge my colleagues to give it their careful and thoughtful consideration"], [0.9104480743408203, 0.9104480743408203, 0, "i support the amendment and i am in support of the final passage of the basic bil really the transplant community has put it a lot better than any of us could i would like to just share with my colleagues some excerpts from some of their comments a sickest first policy would increase the number of retransplants as more patients experience graft rejection and thus reduce the number of organs available for transplantation overall patients would have to become sicker in order to receive a transplant thus reducing their chance for survival this would be completely counterproductive and result in increased cost with reduced success i quote dr r robert higgins director of thoracic organ transplantation henry ford hospital in michigan he went on to say a national list coupled with a sickestfirst policy would make it all but impossible for my patients and in particular patients everywhere that are poor or minority patients to receive a transplant from a physicians point of view without available organs there is nothing i can do to help my patients over the longer term if the rule were in effect today the federal government would essentially be denying the benefits of organ transplantation to a broader number of patients dr higgins of henry ford hospital made those comments joseph brand chairman of the national kidney foundation we believe that less patients would receive liver transplants if the optn were required to develop policies where organs are allocated to the sickest candidates first such candidates are likely to have poor outcomes and require repeat transplants thus reducing the number of organs available for other candidates furthermore nkf has maintained that a sickest first policy should not be applied to renal transplantation because of the availability of dialysis as an alternative therapy mr john r campbell senior vice president and general counsel of lifelink says in talking about the great instances of the donations first costs will dramatically increase because of the required private jet transportation of hearts and livers second warm time warm time or the time from organ procurement to implantation will increase and thereby decrease the function of the organs this will also increase costs the patients at the top of the transplant list are very sick and do not do as well with their transplants as other patients therefore retransplants will increase because very sipk patients are more likely to experience rejection of the organ and transplant hospital

though to some of the debate that took place on the rule the minority leader came here and suggested it was inappropriate for us to be debating this resolution at this time that was also voiced by the ranking minority member of the house international relations committee here today and by others as the gentleman from new york chairman gilman said unfortunately debating the issue before the situation fully developed is important for congress to have a meaningful role i want to remind my colleagues what happened in somalia where without any consultation we saw the administration move from protecting the people involved in the deliveries of food to a nationbuilding process it was classic mission creep i want to remind members what happened in the formulation of the dayton accords when in fact we were told by the administration do not do anything it might upset these delicate negotiations ongoing in dayton then what happened before congress had any opportunity express its view or to have a role before the dayton accords were actually signed troops were on the way to bosnia and we were locked in then what were we told what we had been told before we have to support our troops our men and women in the field and congress was cut out of the process here we are in another similar situation but what we have here is very different what we have here is an invasion by the united states and nato of a sovereign country kosovo is an autonomous region within serbia this member has previously voiced and still has enormous difficulties for many reasons with the proposal for a peace keeping i would have to call it a peace enforcement plan in kosovo chief among them is the members reservation that the president is ready to act outside the unitedstates constitution to engage uninvited unitedstates combat forces in an internal conflict in a country which is not a threat to the united states the unitedstates constitution clearly limits his authority to place unitedstates armed forces in hostile situations but can do so only in response to a national emergency created by attack upon the united states its territories or its armed forces the more extreme measure of launching unprovoked air strikes against serbia a sovereign country for which i have little respect in terms of their leadership who have committed extraordinary atrocities in kosovo nevertheless the administration proposal to deploy troops to kosovo is tantamount to a declaration of war against serbia article i section 8 of the unitedstates constitution specifically grants war declaration authority exclusively to the congress the presidents commitment to deploy our troops into a hostile and foreign territory of kosovo cannot be considered a defensive measure that falls under his authority what is going to happen if we ever have a peace agreement on kosovo it will be coerced and it will have to be an enforced peacefor who knows how long we have an administration which has threatened imagine this if you do not sign mr milosevic we are going to bomb you i suppose we are going to bomb the kla too how does one find the kla to bomb how does one enforce peace on that side let me ask some questions about the current peace proposal we have one party somewhat bound to the unitedstates the other bound by the threat of unitedstates force many questions need to be addressed by what means are we going to protect the kosovars who will police the borders how will we neutralize the danger of kosovo expansion when it has no international status what is the political objective autonomy is not the destination sought by the albanians how do we handle the relationship of the albanians in kosovo with those in the surrounding region what are the rules of engagement what is the concept of how it will end under what authority can nato invade a country in this matter morover the projected kosovo agreement is unlikely to enjoy the support of the parties for a tong period of time for serbia acquiescing under the threat of nato bombardment it involves nearly unprecedented international intercession yugoslavia a sovereign state is being asked tocede control and in time sovereignty of a province containing its national shrines to foreign military force though president slobodan milosevic has much to answer for especially in bosnia he is less the cause of the conflict in kosovo than an expression of it on the need to retain kosovo serbian leaders including milosevics domestic opponentsseem united for serbia current nato policy means either dismemberment of the country or postponement of the conflict to a future date when according to the nato proposal the future of the province will be decided the same attitude governs the albanian side the kosovo liberation army kla is fighting for independence not autonomy the kla is certain to try to use the ceasefire to expel the last serbian influences from the province and drag its feet on giving up its arms and if nato resists it may come under attack itself perhaps from both sides what is described by the administration as a strong peace agreement is likely to be at best the overture to another far more complicated set of conflicts ironically the projected peace agreement increases the likelihood of the various possible escalations sketched by the president as justification for a unitedstates deployment an independent albanian kosovo surely would seek to incorporate the neighboring albanian minontiesmostly in macedonia or fyromand perhaps albania itself and a macedonian conflict would land us precisely back in the balkan wars of earlier in this century will kosovo then become the premise for a semipermanent nato move into macedonia just as the deployment in bosnia is invoked as justification for the move into kosovo is nato to be the home for a whole series of balkan nato protectorates in bosnia the exit strategy can be described the existing dividing lines can be made permanent failure to do so will require their having to be manned indefinitely unless we change our objective to selfdetermination and permit each ethnic group to decide its own fate in kosovo that option does not exist there are no ethnic dividing lines and both sides claim the entire territory americas attitude toward the serbs attempts to insist on their claim has been made plain enough it is the threat of bombing but how do we and nato react to the albanian transgressions and irredentism are we prepared to fight both sides and for how long in the face of issues such as these the unity of the contact group of powers acting on behalf of nato is likely to dissolve russia surely will increasingly emerge as the supporter of the serbian point of view the presidents statements that we can make a difference and that america symbolizes hope and resolve are exhortations not policy prescription this is bumper sticker foreign policy is nato to become the artillery to end ethnic conflict if kosovo why not intervention in east africa or central asia and would a doctrine of universal humanitarian intervention reduce or increase suffering by intensifying ethnic and religious conflict what are the limits of such a policy and by what criteria is it established in henry kissingers view that line should be drawn at american ground forces for kosovo europeans never tire of stressing the need for greater european autonomy here is an occasion to demonstrate it if kosovo presents a security problem it is to europe largely because of the refugees the conflict might generate kosovo is no more a threat to america than haiti was to europeand we never asked for nato support here the nearly 300 million europeans should be able to generate the ground forces to deal with the problems for 2 3 million kosovars to symbolize allied unity on larger issues we should provide logistics intelligence and air support but i see no need for unitedstates ground forces leadership should not be interpreted to mean that we must do everything ourselves again paraphrasing henry kissinger he said in opposing ground troops in kosovo thateach incremental deployment into the balkans is bound to weaken our ability to deal with saddam hussein and north korea the psychological drain may be even more grave each time we make a peripheral deployment the administration is constrained to insist that the danger to american forces is minimalthe kosovo deployment is officially described as a peace implementation force such comments have two unfortunate consequences they increase the impression among

four things that this bill does first it would put on the internet a list of all of these federal paperwork requirements one place where the businesses by industry could go and look if you are a doctors office you would see all of the forms that you have to fill out if you are a sign company you would see all of the forms that you have to fill out if you are a machine tool company you would see all of the forms that you have to fill out it would be on the internet it is widely accessible so that every small businessman would know exactly what their responsibilities are second it would offer small businesses compliance assistance instead of fines on a first time paperwork violation so that frankly we would not be playing gotcha with americas small businesses government would be saying we are on your side we think it is important that you fill out these forms and we will help you do it if you make a mistake we will give you time to correct it there are times when that provision doei not apply and this is what is important it does not apply when doing so would harm or threaten the public interest and as i mentioned in the debate on the rule i would like to offer an amendment after our hour of general debate that tightens that language and addresses some of the concerns to make it clear that if it has the potential to cause serious harm that would mean there is no exemption from the fine it would not apply if it would impede criminal detection or if it would involve one of the internal revenue laws these exceptions we thought were important because the agencies made a good case why they needed to be able to go forward with civil penalties but i will tell you it is my firm belief that filling out a form does not stop an environmental spill filling out a form does not stop somebody who wants to be crooked if 99 percent of americas businesses are good honest decent people but there is one rotten egg trying to cheat the government frankly we are not going to find out because he does not fill out the form there is much too much reliance on paperwork to do the hard diligent work it takes to ferret out those bad actors what we have preserved in this bill are all of the other remedies criminal sanctions if someone commits fraud many of the agencies have injunctive relief where if they find a business is doing something that is illegal doing something that might harm the public they can come in and close it down fda has been doing that for years now where they detect that somebody is producing a product maybe it is apple juice maybe some other food product that might be harmful they do not wait to look at the paperwork they go in with injunctive relief and shut that business down until the problem is corrected that remedy is still available after this bill so this is an important provision and one that i think it is important we think about correctly in the debate the third thing that the bill does is it would create a paperwork czar in each of the agencies who would contact small businesses on paperwork requirements and help them fill out the forms this paperwork czar would be an ombudsman for small businesses within the agency where they could feel they could call up and say how do i do this how do i fill out this form i have gone through half the pile already but i just do not understand this one what do i need to do to comply with the law the fourth one is that it would establish a multiagency task force to study how we can do even better at streamlining those requirements i was enormously impressed with our colleague from new york who reported that with some effort as the head of the labor department in that state he was able to reduce all of those 20some forms down to just 2 or 3 it took hard work i am sure to do that and that is what we hope this multiagency task force will accomplish for us these are 4 important goals 4 things that this legislation accomplishes that will be good for americas small businesses now one reason that this bill is needed is that the federal agencies frankly have not been doing their job under the 1995 paperwork reduction act in 1995 congress mandated and the president signed into law a bill that told the agencies they must reduce their paperwork by 25 percent so that we could take a quarter of this pile of paperwork and throw it out the door as being redundant unnecessary something that was not needed well the record shows the agencies are not doing their job in 1996 they were supposed to reduce it by 10 percent in fact it was only reduced by 2 6 percent then in 1997 they were supposed to reduce it by another 10 percent and it actually increased increased by 2 3 percent and then in 1998 when they were supposed to finish the job make that 5 perceqt reduction the agencies actually increased their paperwork another 1 percent so we have seen a net increase since the paperwork reduction act was enacted in 1995 to me that screams of the need to make a change to that bill and to create the proper mechanisms to actually reduce unnecessary paperwork now there is another provision in the law that congress passed in sbrefa the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act that was passed in 1996 that mandated that the agencies on their own adopt a policy that would allow small businesses to be exempt from the civil penalties very similar to our provision but what it did was it gave the agencies the latitude for adopting their own policies it frankly is very similar to the amendment that my colleague the gentleman from ohio mr kucmnch will bring later today well the record is clear frankly that the agencies are not obeying sbrefa either in fact only 22 of the 77 agencies that assess these civil penalties even submitted a plan and those that did address the question of relief for small businesses did so in a way that often caused more harm what they said was we are still going to impose the fine but then we will allow you to arbitrate to come in hire a lawyer go through an arbitration process and maybe we will reduce the fine at the end of the day as i tried to emphasize earlier madam chairman americas small businesses are not large corporations they do not have hundreds of lawyers on their staff to handle those types of cases they are trying to each day just get a product out the door do their services help the public with what they are providing in the way of their service in their community so that policy actually does more harm than good for that reason i am not able to support the amendment of the gentleman from ohio because it really just repeats the same language that sbrefa had that the agencies have indicated they have no intention of following through with now let me mention a couple of actual examples that our hearings on this bill brought forward last spring our subcommittee held 2 hearings several small businesses were represented at those hearings one lady teresa gearhart who owns a small trucking company with her husband in hope indiana a small town in rural indiana told us that her company has enough business to grow and add new employees that she thinks she could actually add 5 more employees in the coming year but they have made a conscious decision not to do so i was puzzled by this quite frankly and i said teresa why would you not want to expand you seem to be successful you offer a great service to the community she said we have looked at the paperwork and if we go over a certain threshold then the amount of paperwork we have to fill out actually goes up and it is not worth our time we cannot hire somebody to fill it out my husband and i already do all the paperwork as it is and we cannot take anymore so they made a conscious decision to not grow their small business to not offer more opportunities for employment in that community and to not thrive and perhaps have a chance to compete and become one of americas larger businesses a second person who testified was mr gary roberts now gary is the owner of a small company that installs pipelines in the town of sulphur springs indiana he came and told us about a problem that he had with osha now when one mentions osha to americas small businessmen instead of saying yes they come to help me make sure i have a safe work site they cringe because they think osha is going to come and find something that they have not filled out right in their paperwork and charge them 750 2 000 whatever the fine may be this happened to gary roberts he was working on a job his men were on the site they had complied with all of the safety requirements to excavate and lay the pipeline but they had left the manual that repeated all of those requirements that they had been trained on and drilled on back at the office the osha inspector came he did not find anything wrong it was a perfectly safe work site one of the workers actually ran back to the main office and brought the manual to show they had one and had been using it and they were told you are out of luck you did not have it here when i arrived that is a 750 fine that type of gotcha technique is continuing to go on and it is exactly the type of problem that we need to address with this legislation we have heard from farmers as well mr van dyke a muck crop farmer in michigan was fined this year for not having the proper employment disclosure paperwork this was his first violation he had always filled it out he did not have it for some reason and he ended up settling for 17 000 this is a farmer who has workers who help him harvest his crops who had a 17 000 fine this year as a result of a paperwork violation now this is all the paperwork as i said that is required for americas small businesses we need to do better by them we need to reduce that we need to put the agencies on the side of small businesses and we need to do our job in making sure that the paperwork reduction act is working and helping americas small businesses madam chairman i look forward to the debate on the amendments madam chairman i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.891350269317627, 0.891350269317627, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume today i am pleased to bring to the floor for consideration house concurrent resolution 399 which recognizes and honors the 25th anniversary of the passage of the individuals with disabilities education act on november 29 1975 i am pleased so many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have joined me in cosponsoring the resolution since 1975 when congress first authorized the original idea law we have refined and improved the law several times in 1990 the statute was named the individuals with disabilities education act as most everyone knows this act assists states and local school districts with the excess costs of educating students with disabilities in each reconsideration of the law we have worked to ensure greater access to education for all students with disabilities we also have worked increasingly to improve the quality of the education that children with disabilities receive i am especially interested in quality education and am pleased by the progress that children with disabilities are making for instance children with disabilities are increasingly completing their high school education and embarking on postsecondary educations i believe strongly in the goal of idea that every child should have the opportunity to receive a quality education i note that teachers and school administrators also support this goal however we all realize that schools need additional funds to make this goal a reality to this end i have consistently fought for increased funding for idea during my years in congress as a matter of fact for the first 20 years in the minority my colleague the gentleman from michigan and i were the only two who were seeking additional funding yet we all realize what it means to the local school districts to go without that funding that 40 percent of the excess cost that 40 percent is based on the perpupil cost to educate children nationwide and 1 or 2 years ago that was 6 300 which means we should have been sending 2 500 plus dollars in stead local districts have had to make up the money because we have not done the job this is why i kept saying to the president like every other president you do not need some new thing for a legacy all you have to do is help me get this 40 percent then the local districts could do everything they want to do because they would have the money to do it locally just a couple of examples we have new york los angeles chicago miami and washington d c if los angeles had been getting 40 percent they would be getting an additional 118 million a year if new york city were getting their 40 percent they would get 170 million extra every year now imagine what they could have done in all these years to reduce class size if that is what they wanted to do or to maintain their buildings or even build new buildings these are big dollarswe are talking about unfortunately that did not happen in fact 2 years in a row the president sent budgets up to the hill that actually cut the amount of money that would go to special ed in the last 6 years i am happy to show and i am happy to show it because i have been chairman the last 6 years but i am happy to show that we have doubled the amount of money that has gone back to local school districts as my colleagues can see on this chart on this chart we can see the presidents request is in yellow and what the congress has done is in red so we have been able to double that funding which means so much to that local school district we still have other work to do in relationship to having a perfect idea if there is such a thing as perfect in our 1997 amendments we focused the law on the quality education a child with disabilities is to receive rather than upon process and bureaucracy gave parents greater input in determining the best education for their child and gave teachers the tools they need to teach all children well for instance these amendments the individualized education program is developed with the general curriculum in mind and students with disabilities are taking district and statewide assessments in greater numbers both of these improvements mean children with disabilities will receive a higher quality education we decreased the amount of paperwork required of teachers so that they have more time to spend with their students we also dealt somewhat with the discipline problem so i am happy to say that on this anniversary we are now moving in the right direction both in how we present the program and also in the amount of funding that we are providing getting closer to that 40 percent based on the perpupil expenditure in each district i am also happy to say that during the first 20 years as i indicated there were only the gentleman from michigan and myself preaching i thought to the choir but we were not preaching to the choir i guess we were preaching to the heathen as a matter of fact but i am happy to say in the last 6 years we have people coming out of the woodwork on all sides of the aisle to get this money why because i imagine they are hearing from their local school districts what a burden this is to a local school district to try to meet our mandate it is not actually a mandate however if they do not provide a quality education to all children with disabilities they are going to be in real trouble so naturally they are going to take the federal program because they hope they are going to get some federal support i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.8911958932876587, 0.8911958932876587, 0, "i rise tonight to discuss security issues facing this country and to focus the bulk of my discussion on the issue that is going to be i think a major issue for the rest of this year and well into the presidential elections next year and that is a national debate on who lost russia what caused the current economic and political instability that is occurring in that nation that still possesses a vast supply of nuclear material weapons weapons of mass destruction and pose a significant security threat to america before i talk about russia and present some perspectives i would like to first of all commend the congress members on both sides of the aisle for the passage today of the final conference report on the defense authorization bill this bill which passed the house with an overwhelming margin is a tribute to the gentleman from south carolina and the gentleman from missouri the two leaders on defense issues in this congress and to all the members who worked hard on giving our military the best possible support in terms of resources to meet the challenges and threats of the 21st century i am concerned that the bill does not have enough in the way of resources to meet the level of deployments that have been entered into by this administration and by the president in fact the level of deployments over the past 7 years are now at 33 and that in fact compares to 10 deployments in the previous 40 years from world war ii until we cannot continue to have our troops stationed around the world involved in harms way in every possible place from the balkans and kosovo to macedonia and somalia and central america and now perhaps east timor and provide less resources to pay for all these deployments that has been our big problem over the past several years so while this bill does not address all of our needs it certainly is the best possible legislation that we can come up with given the amount of dollars that the administration made available and the amount that we in the congress were able to plus up above the presidents request i would hope the president would sign this bill into law as quickly as possible there was some lastminute controversy raised because of provisions dealing with changes in the management of our department of energyrun laboratories but i can say this that those changes are needed they are important and they are critical we could not have passed doe reform legislation in my mind that the president would have signed had it been in a freestanding bill and therefore including it as a part of our defense authorization bill was extremely important the second issue i would discuss briefly is an announcement that is going to be made tomorrow by the administration regarding a change in the policy over encryption encryption is the technology that we use in the information age to protect and secure transmissions of data up until this point in time we have had strict limitations on the type and capability of encrypted software that we allow our companies to sell overseas the reason is that we do not want terrorist groups in rogue states to be able to get the capability to classify their communications so that our national security agency and intelligence community cannot get into the kinds of transmissions involving illegal activities and drug sales and arms transfers that is so important to our security for the past several years it hasbeen a stalemate many of the software companies have been pushing very hard to pass legislation to remove all limitations on being able to sell encryption software abroad at any bit strength any capability many of us in the congress who are concerned about security issues and members of the permanent select committee on intelligence on both sides of the aisle have raised our voices and have said we cannot just in one fell swoop wipe away the controls that allow us to maintain the kind of access to secure systems that allow america to protect our troops abroad as well as our homeland here in fact in each of the last two sessions of congress i have offered successfully amendments in the subcommittee on defense to the encryption bill overwhelmingly supported by democrats and republicans to slow down this process and to force us to look at the security concerns we have said during our opportunities to amend this bill both last year and most recently in july or august this past summer that we were looking for a compromise that we were looking for a way that we in fact could allow our companies to maintain their market share worldwide but also at the same time provide mechanisms for the national security agency and the intelligence community to make sure that they were being consulted when this technology was being sold in a meeting i had with deputy secretary of defense john hamre just 1 hour ago in my office he told me that tomorrow the administration will be announcing what i think will be a successful compromise that will allow industry to be happy but will allow those of us who have security concerns to be happy that we are in fact not giving away capability to our adversaries that may come back to haunt us this compromise which has yet to be worked out in terms of legislative language will do three things it will allow a process to be kept in place to make sure that our intelligence and defense community have a process before an application is granted for an encrypted software to be sold overseas above the 64bit strength capability this gives our technical people the ability to monitor the kind of software encryption that we are selling so that they understand the implications of the sale secondarily the companies will certify the end user of this encrypted algorithm software so that we know where the encryption is going to make sure it is not going near the hands of a terrorist group or perhaps a nation that is a direct opponent of the unitedstates thus could cause security problems for us the third provision would allow the defense department and the administration and intelligence community to oppose the sale of this more capable encryption to a nation or to an entity that we feel would pose a security threat to america based on these three conditions the administration and dr hamre are going to announce this change tomorrow and i am convinced that this change would not have occurred were it not for the efforts of members of the national security committee and permanent select committee on intelligences who stood up and cast very difficult votes the intense lobbying campaign by the private software companies who have significant pacs and who were having a significant influence on republican and democrat members brought tremendous pressure to bear on many members who wanted to make sure that our security was not being jeopardized in last years vote in the house subcommittee on defense and last years permanent select committee on intelligence and in this years votes in the house subcommittee on defense and permanent select committee on intelligences democrats and republicans stood together they said that we want to make sure in spite of the tremendous pressure by these software companies that we give every possible consideration to our security concerns those security concerns apparently are now being met tomorrow we will hear the outline of the specifics from the administration i have offered my support to dr hamre to work to develop bipartisan legislation to amend the safe act the goodlatte bill to provide for a compromised solution to what has been a stalemate in this country over the exportation of encrypted software i want to particularly thank the members of congress who were leaders in this effort and who without their support this compromise would not have occurred on the committee on armed services in particular i want to thank the gentleman from virginia he was the cosponsor of the amendment that i offered this year which passed in the committee with a vote of 46 to 8 overwhelming support by republicans and democrats that bipartisan support was obtained because of the leadership of the gentleman from virginia"], [0.8907410502433777, 0.8907410502433777, 0, "i

the neps purpose is to facilitate state and local governments preparation of comprehensive conservation and management plans ccmps for threatened and impaired estuaries in support of this effort section 320 authorizes the epa to make grants to states to develop ccmps for 30 designated estuaries across the country while the nep has been successful in developing these ccmps 20 of which have been completed the law does not authorize appropriations for implementation of the ccmpsa deficiency which threatens to slow our progress in restoring these estuaries my own state of new jersey has three approved sites in the nep one of which barnegat bay lies primarily within my district the barnegat bay watershed drains from a land area of approximately 550 square miles over 450 000 people live within the barnegat bay watershed that population doubles in the summer as people flock to the shore the continued economic health of the barnegat bay watershed is dependent on the continued health and natural beauty of its waters the bamegat bay estuary is not only a vital component of new jerseys tourist industry but is an important natural resource that supports populations of commercially and recreationally significant fish and rare and endangered species nonpoint source pollution while diffuse is cumulatively the most important issue in addressing adverse impacts on water quality and the health of living resources in the bay the contaminants found in rain and snowmelt as well as groundwater contribute to nonpoint source pollution the final comprehensive and conservation management plan for barnegat bay will be available to the public in may 2000 for public review but without the additional funding for this program as well as explicitly permitting the

about this issue during that time i am happy to yield to my friend from oregon who refused to i guess like the chinese leadership refused to yield to me when i was simply going to ask a question in response to the fact that the gentleman from michigan referred to me so let me just take a few minutes to respond to a couple of those points that were made that come to mind and then talk about this general issue and then i should inform my friends that i would love to do this over the hour but because of the fact that my colleagues would not yield to me and because of time constraints i have to be upstairs for another commitment in about 12 minutes there are two television programs i am going to be debating in fact the minority whip on one of the television programs where he and i will discuss this but it was a previous commitment that my office made for me so i hope my friends will understand but i will try within the 12minute period that i have to unlike my friendsfrom the other side of the aisle yield to them for a question or a comment and i will do it just as generously as i possibly can it will certainly be more generous than my democratic colleagues did let me say this this vote that we are going to be casting the day after tomorrow is the single most important vote that we will cast clearly in this session of the congress i believe that as we look at this question it really transcends simply the issue of job creation and economic growth it has to do with whether the united states of america is going to maintain its role as the paramount global leader why is that so important it is very important because this building in which we are all seated or standing happens to be the symbol throughout the world for freedom and one of the most important freedoms that exists happens to be economic freedom now my colleagues were talking about the fact that over the past 2 decades we have seen the united states grant most favored nation status to the peoples republic of china and look how bad the situation is well mr speaker they are not going to get an argument from me about many of the problems that exist in china today i am the first to admit that we have very serious human rights problems in fact i will take a back seat to no one in this congress or anywhere in demonstrating concern about human rights i have adopted refuseniks i brought wounded mujahadine in from afghanistan during that war i have worked for human rights i marched to the chinese embassy the week after the tiananmen square massacre in june of so anyone who tries to claim that those of us who believe passionately in economic freedom and want to expand that throghont china anre snmehow placing american business interests above the interests of our very precious american values are wrong they are wrong in making that claim they fail to realize the interdependence of political and economic freedom and they fail to recognize that while over the last couple of decades we have dealt with a situation which has provided china oneway access to the unitedstates consumer market this is a vote that is unlike any in the past this vote does in fact pry open that market with 1 3 billion consumers nearly five times the population of the united states do they have a standard of living or awage rate that is anything like that of the united states absolutely not 0 2100 i want them to i want them to i aspire toseeing economic strength throughout the world and even for the impoverished hundreds of millions in china now the minority whip talked earlier about some quotes that came from chinese leaders stating that if in the area of insurance for example they do not like a decision that is made they will ignore it they talked about the area of agriculture and some leader in china saying if they do not like exactly what is taking place insome deal that is put together that they will just null and void it that is the whole point of what it is we are trying to do here we are trying to put into place a structure whereby the peoples republic of china a country that yes has violated agreements in the past a country that has not been forthright a country that has been very repressive they will under this agreement be forced to live with a rulesbased trading system and as i said for the first time they will be forced to open up their markets what happens if they decide to thumb their nose at an agreement that is made we have for the first time an opportunity with 134 other nations this international organization known as the wto and i know many people like to criticize it but do they know what the goal of the wto going right back to when it was the general agreement on tariffs and tradein 1947 established following the second world war do they know what the goal of it was to cut taxes to cut taxes that is the raison detre for what was the gatt and now the wto because a tariff is a tax a tax unfortunately creates a situation whereby we do not allow for the free flow of goods and services let us talk about the issue of automobiles and i will say that on the issue of automobiles we have a situation where we export about 600 cars a year into china that tariff is 45 percent it drops under this agreement i cannott say that every one of the 1 3 billion chinese will be able to buy a sport utility vehicle at 50 000 but i will say this that there will be an opportunity to sell more unitedstates manufactured automobiles in china i will say another thing they keep saying on the other side of the aisle that we are trying to do everything that we possibly can to make sure that companies have a chance to move to china set up operations there well they can do that today guess what they have to do it today because of domestic content requirements that exist in china but under this agreement those domestic content requirements are thrown out so the incentive that many companies have to open up their plants in china today will not be as great i do not want to stop any company from making a business decision if they want to move to china i do not think it is my responsibility i do not think it is governments responsibility to block the free flow of goods services ideas or businesses but i do think that anything we can do to provide an incentive for a level playing field whereby these companies can stay in the united states and still sell

here to washington and we talk about the issue of medicare prescription drugs as we have for months and months and sometimes the discussion the dialogue gets fairly arcane and complicated and seems to go far from the flesh and blood of the people we are trying to represent and the gentleman from erie just talked about the fact that seniors should not have to at that stage of their lives be worrying about whether or not they can afford their prescription benefit i want to read a letter that i received recently from just such a senior in my district who certainly is worrying she is from holland pennsylvania which is the little town that my family moved into in 1955 she wrote this letter to me just a few weeks ago a couple of weeks ago dear congressman greenwood i never thought that i would come to this time in my life and findmyself neglecting my health out of sheer necessity i am a widow 70 years of age my medical problems require drugs that amount to over 1 000 per month i am enrolled in aetna unitedstates health care which has a cap on prescription drugs of 500 a year after filling out the prescriptions my cap was met i am in pain daily and i cannot correct this problem because of financial difficulty i have stopped taking prilosec which costs her 285 each month zoloft approximately 100 a month losomax another 100 a month xanax approximately 100 a month and zocor 100 or more i need these drugs filled monthly and i simply cannot afford them i am also in need of pain pill vioxx which costs 89 and i have not been able to purchase it i have cried myself to sleep over this dilemma i had to visit my pulmonary doctor who diagnosed me with fullblown asthma and chronic bronchitis my doctor told me that i cannot miss a day taking my medication for my lungs i take zevent two puffs twice a day flovent two puffs twice a day and albuterol 2 puffs every 4 hours the prescription for each is 98 times three lasts 2 weeks so 98 every 2 weeks for each of these three medications that is 600 per month right there i cannot stop taking this i tried and ran into breathing problems again i also must take zithomax for chronic infection 89 i must keep this on hand always also my ophthalmologist prescribed xalton for glaucoma which i must take faithfully nightly another 89 the drugs i must take average about 800 per month the other drugs i need for osteoporosis reflux and hiatal hernia anxiety and depression high cholesterol and nerves i had to eliminate them and i can feel my health decliningeach day i tried a generic brand drug for my lung infection and i had to end up taking three zithromax as the generic did not help me my problem is that i make 200 too much per month to qualify for assistance you figure this out i have two friends who make 200 and 250 less than i do per month they are paying 6 for all their prescriptions because they qualify for the program they are gettingi help with their electric bill they are being well taken care of they are able to go out to dinner weekly and on a bus trip now and then i can do none of this my money is going to prescription drugs i just pray that some good congressman like you could make the guys in washington see what this drug problem for the aged is doing to us we worked hard all of our lives and then have to come to this that is a pretty persuasive argument i think a pretty poignant letter from a real woman who lives in my district a 70yearold widow who is only able to use every penny of her income simply for the drugs that she has to have to stay alive and then she neglects her other needs and so her cholesterol problem her anxiety her depression her pain her osteoporosis all of those conditions go unchecked because she does not have this benefit that is why all of us in washington who care about this issue are trying so hard to get this done and that is why we have come here tonight to talk about the bipartisan bill if this issue is not handled in a bipartisan fashion my constituent this 70yearold woman will not get relief it is absolutely the case the people of the united states have elected a republican house and a republican senate and they have a democratic president in the white house for us to get this done this year we have to exercise bipartisanship and that is why this bill that we are supporting is bipartisan now unfortunately in the special order that came before us my friend the gentleman from new jersey and i will give him credit for this he comes to the floor every night just about and makes a speech about prescription drugs but what is so discouraging to me is the level of partisanship there are reasons for there to be differences between the presidents plan the democrats plan and the republican plan because this is a hard problem to solve andit takes different kinds of thinking from different perspectives there are reasons why the republican plan is different this is a complex issue one of those differences between the two plans is that we think that you need catastrophic coverage we think that it is important that when some of these drugs that can cost 10 000 to 20 000 per year you cannot stop the coverage at 2 000 and let the individual be on their own becausethat is not going to help my constituent my constituent will not be helped by that because she will run out of money and not only will her insurance coverage not be sufficient but now the medicare coverage will not be sufficient and that is not good enough when you look at the presidents plan and when you look at the republican plan there are differences i happen to prefer the republican plan but the fact of the matter is they are more alike than they are different what we have got to do this year is we have to be bipartisan and make sure that the bipartisan bill is adopted by the house that we take ideas from other members we negotiate this with the president and get it done when you see members of congress come to the well of this house or sit in committee hearings and meetings and when you hear them looking for common ground and looking for a bipartisan approach when you have republicans and democrats supporting the same kind of legislation then you know these are serious members who care about 70yearold widows from holland pennsylvania who cry themselves to sleep at night conversely when you see members of congress come to the well of the house and you listen to them in the hearings and they spend most of their time emphasizing the differences contrasting the republicans and the democrats this lady does not care whether the bill is a republican bill or a democratic bill she wants a bipartisan approach that gets the job done when you see members constantly emphasizing partisan differences then you have to conclude that these are members who are not interested in solving the problem they are interested in winning elections they are interested in political gain and leverage and i think that is what is shameful we need to get this done in a bipartisan fashion the bipartisan bill we are here to talk about tonight will do that i urge my colleagues in the congress to support that i would again

return the compliment the gentleman from missouri has been a leader on this issue and frankly without the gentlemans hard work and without his dedication and devotion we would not have this opportunity to come forward tonight and to talk about what is i know shared in america and is understood to be a very very important issue we have heard about the compact tonight but as the gentleman noted we have a very important markup tomorrow in the committee on agriculture dealing with a very complex issue with respect to milk market orders i like many of us have listened over the past several weeks heard the discussion from those members who do not share our perspective i have read their statements and i think unfortunately there is a great deal of misunderstanding there is a great deal of misinformation as to the particulars of milk marketing and milk market reform i think however we can all agree on one thing and that is that the current system of milk marketing in america is extraordinarily complex some would say it is arcane and it is true the proliferation the really fragmented evolution that has surrounded the growth of marketing orders in america today has really provided us with what i think we can all agree upon is a very ineffective system but for all of that complexity and for all of the need for change i think that the need for the market order system today in 1999 is as evident and is as important as it was back in the 1930s clearly some of the things from 60plus years ago when the original market orders were first constructed exist today as they did then milk production as the gentleman from missouri"], [0.0021443963050842285, 0.49785560369491577, 0, "to the gentleman my friend from durham nc i want to read to him that we got word just a few minutes ago from the gentleman from north carolina that the white house not the house or senate leadership demanded that the 508 million for north carolina relief be taken out of the laborhhs bill i was not there and i do not know but i wanted to pass that on since i was asked to share that with the house body i will say that we have worked very closely together this is what i think is good about this congress and good about america the american people know when their brothers and sisters are in trouble that they come forward and do what they can to assist them i think this resolution is proper i am sorry if it has been read as politics but i do not really think that it should be because right or wrong there is a belief that we need to have the guidance and the leadership of the president to come forward to the congress with his recommendation after consulting with omb with recommendations as to what should be done for the people that have been devastated by hurricane floyd whether it be north carolina or other parts of the united states that have been devastated some of the frustration that we hear back home and let me first say that fema and these other agencies and the multitude of volunteers has been enormous it really does the heart well to know how much people care about others that are in trouble but some of the frustration back home as the gentleman from ohio just mentioned is that the citizens in eastern north carolina who pay the taxes we are elected in washington to spend their tax dollars it is the taxpayer that is in trouble now particularly in eastern north carolina as well as other parts new jersey and some in maryland and some other parts that need the help of the congress again it is their money it is not our money it is the peoples money the people that pay thetaxes one thing that comes to mind that i hear quite frequently in my district i do not vote for foreign aid i have been here 5 years and i have yet to vote for foreign aid and i do not intend to vote for foreign aid until i see it down in single digits 6 7 billion instead of 12 or 14 billion we passed a bill that was 12 7 billion in foreign aid and the president wants 4 billion more again i voted against that because i thought the 12 7 billion was too much money another problem that we are having is that people read recently where the president of the united states said well we ought to forgive 36 countries that owe th united states of america they do not owe the united states of america they owe the people that make up the united states of america 5 billion so the people in eastern north carolina want to know if we can forgive a debt of 5 million why can we not get a couple of billion out of the congress to help them as they try to recover from this devastation again i have to answer these questions back home so i am bringing it to the floor of the house this summer the united states sent 500 000 in flood relief to aid china every time i have been on the floor of the house and had a chance to vote i am opposed to mfn for china so it is important that we forget the politics and we talk about coming together and passing legislation that

previous speakers this is quite an extraordinary event which we can produce over a period of less ise march 23 2000 than 5 years a budget that goes from deficit to not only to going to surplus but protecting 100 percent of that surplus for social security while strengthening medicare and providing the resources that are necessary to provide prescription coverage for seniors retiring potentially the entire public debt by the year 2013 at the same time promoting tax relief for families farmers and seniors providing significant increases in defense and strengthening support for education and science i am here specifically to talk about one aspect of education that is of particular interest to me and that is funding for the individuals with disabilities education act commonly known as special education when i came to congress in 1996 total funding was justa little bit more than 3 5 billion or about 5 percent of the total 40 percent mandated as required by law i am pleased to say that in this budget this year we have incorporated instructions to the appropriators to increase special education funding by a full 2 billion which is almost 100 percent of what the entire funding was when i came to congress in 1996 full funding of special education is good education policy it is good policy for communities for families for school administrators for those who are affected and participate in idea programs but most importantly it is also a form of tax relief for us to have failed to meet this unfunded mandate for so many years is inexcusable what we do in this budget is move a long way towards meeting that obligation i stand here today as a proud supporter of the budget plan that we have here before us today and for american families for taxpayers i urge the adoption of

the last minute which were wrong for the american taxpayer wrong for the environment and wrong for the development of longterm water policy in my state of california over the past 2 weeks i have worked hard with members of the committee on transportation and infrastructure and members of the house in general to address the implications of this water grab the baydelta in my district is the largest estuary on the west coast and serves as the drinking water source for 22 million californians moreover it serves as a key component of the states 24 billion agricultural industry in california

davisbacon to have to fall under construction we think that is wrong a it adds between 15 to 35 percent to the school construction we are saying let the schools keep the extra money instead of paying

florida texas colorado louisiana and south carolina according to the bills sponsor that leaves 44 states without funding to enhance gun enforcement i personally think if we are going to do this all
