russian revolution i have placed in this record several years past the white paper issued by president coolidge secretary of state prank kellogg in which he gives as a reason and rationalizes the sending of the marines in 1929 into nicaragua in hot pursuit of sandino himself though they never caught him and then occupying that country for 13 years making sure that we installed the militia known as the guardia civil that we installed the somoza dictatorship and despotism of that family and eventually it was due like a rotten tomato to just cave in as it did in 1979 everybody outside of

improvement act on elementary and secondary foreign language programs the first would restore a provision for the critical foreign languages program in the secretarys discretionary fund of the department of education while the second would establish presidential awards of excellence in the teaching of foreign languages i am very pleased to be joined by representative sawyer in introducing the first amendment and equally pleased to have your support and that of the ranking minority member for both measures the critical foreign languages program of the secretarys discretionary fund is a small but important component of the federal governments involvement in foreign language education at the elementary and secondary levels for the past 3 years this program has been allocated 2 million each year mostly for grants to fund a total of 70 foreign language programs at the elementary and secondary levels the types of programs funded are those that are superior in and of themselves or are good models mostly in the areas of teacher training and curriculum development for critical foreign languages this category officially includes a total of over 100 languages though there is a narrower category of the 11 most critical and a large portion of the programs are actually in just 3 languages chinese japanese and arabic there is a concentration on these three because among those languages critical to our national security and economic prosperity there is a special need for programs in these three most of the programs to date have been cooperative ventures between local schools and institutions of higher education in addition some money has gone directly to state education associations to aid in the development of statewide plans for foreign language curriculums the critical languages program has become one of the most effective among those funded by the secretarys discretionary fund and as i mentioned one of the best foreign language programs at the federal level nonetheless it was deleted from the school improvement act by the committee largely as i understand because the discretionary fund is mostly intended to fund math and science programs and because an option to spend money on foreign language programs would still be retained however historically nearly all the money in the discretionary fund not specifically earmarked for foreign languages has been used to meet pressing math and science needs while i applaud the increased attention to foreign languages recently demonstrated by congress in h r 3 the critical foreign languages program of the secretarys discretionary fund is much more valuable than its small funding level of approximately 2 million would suggest it is the only part of title iii specifically earmarked for foreign languages and departmental staff have ensured that these funds are used for innovative and solid programs eliminating critical foreign languages from the discretionary fund would mean that little or no title ii money would go toward foreign languages and a small but important portion of the federal governments foreign language program would be lost my amendment would add foreign languages to math and science as an eligible area for funding under section 2130 national programs of title iicritical skills improvement of the school improvement act it would in addition set aside 25 percent of the funds in national programs specifically for the improvement and expansion of instruction in critical foreign languages this amendment restores the status quo for this program before the drafting of h r 5 and would not increase the cost of h r 5 because funds would be taken out of those authorized for the entire program this amendment would guarantee the continuation of a small but important program focusing on languages essential to our security and economic wellbeing and therefore constitute a contribution to our country far in excess of the resources devoted to it my second measure would establish a system of presidential awards for teaching excellence in foreign languages in order to focus national attention on the critical need for foreign language teachers few people would i believe deny that such a pressing need exists in a recent survey by the national association of state supervisors of foreign language teachers 57 percent of the states responding reported a current shortage and almost 65 percent expect to experience such a shortage in the near future while considerable attention has been devoted to decreasing the shortage of teachers in other areas notably math and science important to our security and economic prosperity relatively little effort has been made to remediate a comparably great shortage of foreign language teachers my amendment which would add a new section 2135 to title iicritical skills improvement would take a small but significant step toward correcting this major deficiency in oureducational system a total of 104 awards would be made by the president to elementary and secondary teachers who have demonstrated outstanding teaching qualifications in the field of foreign languages at least one elementary and one secondary school teacher from each state as well as the district of columbia and puerto rico would be selected thereby ensuring attention across the nation to foreign language teachers the cost of this program would be 1 million for fiscal year 1988 with the necessary sums being allocated in subsequent years while this amendment would not actually create a new federal foreign language program these presidential awards would significantly add to the prestige of good foreign language teachers and thereby motivate a greater number of more highly qualified persons to become and remain foreign language teachers this would have significant value beyond the relatively small cost of the program as it is now difficult for many school districts across the country to attract and retain highly qualified foreign language instructors in general as i noted foreign language instruction has been neglected in favor of other critical skills given that the ease of learning a second language is inversely proportional to age it is discouraging to find that only 1 percent of students in our elementary schools receive any kind of foreign language training moreover a 198283 survey showed that only 21 3 percent of all high school students were enrolled in foreign language courses 88 percent of which were in spanish and french these distressing facts attest to the need to devote much more and higher quality attention to foreign languages especially at the elementary and secondary levels this measure would dramatically increase the prestige of teaching foreign languages and therefore help improve instruction in and attention to foreign languages in the crucial years to come global interdependency is a fact of life and america can no longer exist in this world wearing linguistic blinders the investment in our future national security and prosperity represented by these two measures is very minimal yet the stakes are high we must act now to put our foreign language and international education system back on track and these amendments represent small but significant steps in this direction i therefore urge the support of my colleagues for both measures"], [0.4152984619140625,

development of this essential legislation plenty has been said as to the need for this legislation legislation which should permit us to round the bend in this war to eradicate drug abuse in this great country instead i rise to explain the provisions of fitle vii the portion of the antidrug bill developed by the committee on merchant marine and fisheries in a true bipartisan fashion in developing our title the committee sought to provide for more effective coast guard enforcement of laws relating to drug trafficking this goal is addressed through two avenues first this legislation clarifies several legal questions which have arisen since the enactment of the antidrug abuse act of 1986 second the legislation authorizes additional appropriations for coast guard operations and the purchase of equipment for fiscal years 1989 through 1992 allow me to briefly explain the provisions contained in our title and our reasoning behind their inclusion since the passage of the antidrug abuse act of 1986 several legal questions have arisen which had the potential september 7 1 988 september 7 1988 coi1 to adversely impact the coast guards drug interdiction efforts these include first personal liability exposure of naval commanding officers involved in drug interdiction activities second enforcement problems related to difficulties in determining the flag status of vessels and third liability exposure of the coast goard and its employees the antidrug abuse act of 1986 authorized coast guard law enforcement detachments ledetsj to engage in drug interdiction activities from navy vessels liability problems may occur when naval vessels have to fire into a vessel suspected of drug smuggling which refuses to stop if personnel on the suspect vessel are injured and a search of the vessel turns up no drugs the naval commanding officer may be subject to a law suit under section 637 of title 14 united states code commanding officers of coast guard vessels and persons acting under their orders are indemnified from penalties or damages when a coast guard vessel fires at or into another vessel that does not stop following an order to do so on two occasions navy ships with coast guard ledets aboard have had to fire into suspect vessels that refused to stop on both occasions the vessels contained large amounts of drugs in one instance one person was injured fortunately no one was killed given the continued escalation of drug smuggling and the associated violence the frequency of these types of events will likely increase thereby exposing naval personnel to increased opportunities for personal liability claims section 7002 of our title serves to correct this problem by extending indemnification protection to naval commanding officers and personnel acting under their orders aboard navy vessels on which coast guard law enforcement detachments are assigned pursuant to section 379 of title 14 united states code the coast guard has encountered two types of cases where it has had difficulty in enforcing the maritime drug law enforcement act of 1980 because of problems related to determination of the flag status of a vessel the first case occurs when drug smugglers sink their vessel to avoid detection during the boarding a related situation occurs when the occupants of a vessel the registry of which can not be determined at the time of the boarding later raise a valid foreign registry as a defense in court the second case occurs when the vessels flag state retains jurisdiction but shows little interest in prosecuting unitedstates citizens or resident aliens current law does not allow the coast guard to proceed against unitedstates citizens or resident aliens in either of these cases under section 3 a of the maritime drug enforcement act 46 unitedstatesc app 1903 a it is unlawful to knowingly or intentionally manufacture or distribute or to possess with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance on any vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states section 7003 of our title extends the application of section 3 a of the act to include unitedstates citizens and resident aliens aboard a vessel of any nation this would allow the united states to try a unitedstates citizen or resident alien for a violation of the maritime drug enforcement act if the flag state of the foreign vessel fails to try the individual for the offense under the law of that country this section is not intended to limit the authority of the flag state to take custody of and proceed against the individual it would also not change the existing requirement for consent of the flag state before the coast guard boards a foreign vessel on the high seas or in the territorial waters of another nation nor would it change international procedures and arrangements for obtaining custody of unitedstates citizens through extradition proceedings subsection b of section 7003 amends section 3 b 2 of the maritime drug enforcement act to require that claims of vessel nationality or registry be raised at the time of boarding by the coast guard this addresses the situation in which a vessel appears to be a unitedstates vessel at the time of the boarding but individuals charged with a violation of the act later raise the vessels foreign registry as a defense to prosecution requiring that a claim of foreign registry be raised at the time of boarding would allow an inquiry into the vessels registry and appropriate requests to the state of registry for a waiver of jurisdiction the coast guards increased emphasis on drug interdiction has also led to increased exposure of coast guard employees and the coast guard itself to law suits currently coast guard employees are liable for actions undertaken in the performance of their duties this exposure has resulted in 32 suits being filed against coast guard personnel the coast guard itself is also subject to suits for all of its maritime activities under the authority of the suits in admiralty act on land however it is protected from common law torts by the federal tort claims act ftcaj this has the anomalous effect of exposing the coast guard to a variety of suits for actions taken at sea which would be protected by ftca if they were carded out on land we have sought to alleviate this problem through the legislation incorporated as sections 7004 and 7005 section 7004 authorizes the commandant of the coast guard to indemnify any coast guard member or employee against personal liability for actions taken within the scope of their official law enforcement duties it is patterned after the authority of the federal aviation administrator to indemnify federal aviation administration employees for damages for actions taken within the scope of their employment section 7005 incorporates certain of the exceptions to suits against the united states presently contained in the federal tort claims act 28 unitedstatesc 26712680 and is intended to clarify maritime law relating to the liability of the united states prior to 1960 admiralty suits against the united states other than those arising from the operation of certain vessels were brought under the federal tort claims act in 1960 congress amended the suits in admiralty act 46 unitedstatesc app 741752 to encompass all admiralty actions in order to remove uncertainty over the proper forum for certain claims against the united states on land the unitedstates government and its employees are protected from common law torts by the federal tort claims act the federal tort claims act does not apply on the navigable waters of the united states or on the high seas on those waters the suits in admiralty act applies the suits in admiralty act does not contain several of the exceptions to suit contained in the federal tort claims act section 7005 would amend the suits in admiralty act to include several exceptions currently provided under the federal tort claims act specifically the exceptions for discretionary function and customs detention are particularly important with respect to coast guard law enforcement efforts for example claims frequently arise with respect to seizure of vessels during maritime law enforcement efforts in some cases vessels containing large quantities of illicit narcotics have been seized but have sunk before they could be returned to a unitedstates port and claims have been filed against the united states for loss of the vessel because the vessel is destroyed no property is available to effect a forfeiture therefore the ability of the united states to use the defense that the vessel was subject to forfeiture and that title vested in the united states at the time of commission of the act notwithstanding the lack of a declaration of forfeiture is unclear inclusion of the federal tort claims act customs detention exception from suit within the suits in admiralty act provision would insure that the united states is not liable for damage to detained property on navigable waters of the united states or the high seas under the same circumstances as is presently the case for damage to detained property that occurs ashore section 7006 amends s ction 2 of title 14 united states code to specifically authorize the c ast guard to enforce and assist in the er orrimont of all unitedstates laws over as well as on and under waters subject to the jurisdiction of the united states and the high seas the section also adds maritime air surveillance or interdiction to the coast guards primary law enforcement duties the committee does not intend that this section interfere with or override the provisions of the memorandum of understanding between the unitedstates coast guard and the unitedstates customs service signed may 11 1987 and approved by the national drug policy board section 7007 requires the secretary of transportation and the secretary of the treasury to sign an agreement reflecting the most effective use of unitedstates coast guard and unitedstates customs service resources to interdict iliigal drugs on the great lakes the section also encourages the secretary of state to begin negotiations with officials of the canadian government on an agreement to increase cooperation between and coordination of our respective governments efforts to interdict drugs on the great lakes the agreement and negotiations under this section will not only increase the effectiveness of drug interdiction on the great lakes but will also have a deterrent effect against any increase of drug activity on the great lakes section 7008 has as its basis the belief that the owner of a conveyance and those who rely on the continued operation of that conveyance in order to earn a livelihood should not be punished for the actions of another h 7098 cor which are beyond the knowledge and without the consent of the owner this concern arose as a result of the implementation of the administrations zero tolerance policy seemingly overnight we are appilsed of numerous inequitable instances when for example a fishing vessel would be seized and be subject to being forfeited because some small amount perhaps even just a trace of illegal substances were found in the personal belongings of one of the crew members this placed an economic hardship upon the innocent when in fact it was the guilty individual who should bear the burden of the punishment section 7008 of our title provides that no vessel vehicle or aircraft shall be forfeited to the extent of an interest of an owner for a drugrotated offense established by that owner to have been committed or omitted without the knowledge or consent of the owner finally a perennial coast guard problem is the lack of adequate funding these problems are evidenced by the fact that over the past 5 years in constant dollar terms the coast guard has been level funded by way of comparison the department of defense has seen its budget increase by over 15 percent during the same period in an effort to help alleviate coast guards funding problems the department of defense has periodically provided the coast guard with additional funds for the purchase of new equipment but has provided very little additional funds for operations the coast guards operating expenses problems reached the breaking point in fiscal year 1988 when it suffered a 103 million funding shortfall this forced it to close a number of units to reduce law enforcement efforts by 55 per cent and to cease performing discretionary search and rescue patrols section 7009 authorizes appropriations for the coast guard to remain available until expended of 264 million for acquisition construction and improvements 82 million for operating expenses for fiscal year 1989 and 30 million per year for operating expenses fer fiscal years 1990 1991 and 1992 this money shall be used to provide 500 additional fulltime positions and to

additional expenditures at least in the agriculture committee we did exercise fiscal responsibility for 1987 and show no additional expenditures to the budget however for 1988 and the outyears we too have problems i am concerned about the homeless individuals and families however as we did in house joint resolution 102 we must be able to pay for the benefits we provide of the many issues before the 100th congress this is one which i find to be difficult to resolve as i have said before during the several hearings the subcommittee has held concerning this issue of food assistance to the needy i firmly believe that in our nation of abundance it is a tragedy for one child or one elderly person or anyone to go hungry we are a generous countryboth through government programs and through the private sector usda programs alone provide over 20 billion in food assistance private sector contributions to various nonprofit organizations regularly increase from year to year and approached 80 billion last year and yet there is no dispute that there are significant numbers of homeless people in both urban and rural areas of the united states the causes of homelessness are many and are complex they include the deinstitutionalization of mental health patients redevelopment of cities and the loss of lowrent housing highunemployment rates and a breakdown in traditional family structure the federal state and local programs available to low income individual and families often do not meet the needs of the homeless despite the bilions spent each year while housing is the key issue in dealing with homelessness other services are needed as well these include food assistance health and mental health clinics and for those who are able assistance in getting and keepng jobs the two major programs under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee that provide food assistance are the food stamp program and the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap neither of which are designed for the homeless but both provide assistance to this group of individuals through the food stamp program participants are provided food coupons which in most cases supplement the food budget of low income people however for the homeless difficulties arise in making full use of food coupons since they lack homes and cooking and food storage facilities last year the congress amended the food stamp act to allow the homeless to use food coupons in shelters and soup kitchens this provision was patterned after a proposal that i was working on along with chairman panetta concerning demonstration projects designed to allow the homeless to purchase low cost nutritious meals at soup kitchens while the amendment adopted last year does not address all concerns we covered in our proposal i am anxious to see how this further extension of the food stamp program to the homeless will work the pilot project we proposed presented a unique opportunity to begin solving a difficult problem in a straightforward manner lacking facilities for storage and preparation of food homeless individuals are unable to make optimal use of food stamp benefits to which they may be entitled by permitting such eligible individuals to use food stamps to purchase lowcost prepared meals the proposal would increase the effectiveness of the program for some of its most needy beneficiaries those operating the soup kitchens could have used food stamps for the purchase of food in large quantities thereby maximizing the efficiency of food stamp benefits for the homeless in addition the use of food stamps would have been limited to the purchase of food rather than preparation services and other associated costs also maximizing food stamp program funds by alleviating hunger and adhere to the goal of the food stamp act the second program under our committees jurisdiction is the temporary emergency food assistance program tefap provides surplus commodities to states for distribution to organizations serving lowincome people some of whom are homeless in 1988 it is anticipated that the commodities made available will include 420 million pounds of cheese 180 million pounds of rice 144 million pounds of flour 96 million pounds of honey 96 million pounds of nonfat dry milk 72 million pounds of butter and 48 million pounds of cornmeal with regard to tefap i am pleased that the congress acted to overturn the proposed deferral of 28 6 million of tefap administrative funds i introduced house joint resolution 124 which disapproved that deferral so that the full amount of money states had planned to use to distribute surplus foods will be available during this year the agriculture committee may be able to contribute to easing the problems of the homeless but solving this problem will require much more and must involve not only the federal government but state and local governments and our communities as well i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.6028919219970703,

investigative testing of current employees i want to make it very clear that what we are trying to do with this particular amendment is respond both to the legitimate needs of american business and industry and at the same time deal with the overuse and abuse of the polygraph how do we do that first of all at least 75 percent of all polygraph tests in this country are used for preemployment screening i think most people will agree that perhaps the biggest concern over the polygraph is that it is used so extensively in preemployment when used for preemployment screening the polygraph is first intimidating and no 2 it tends to be the sole determinant of whether the job applicant is or is not hired or offered that job yet as we go through the long litany of concerns here today we talk about the climb of the exams use in business the amendment before us as i indicated tries to respond to the particular concerns that i think many people have raised with regard to this legislation that is now before us the amendment does so in a way that does not handicap or absolutely handcuff the ability of business and industry in this country to deal with the legitimate threat of internal theft and crimes within industry in this country first of all there is great concern about whether or not the polygraph examination is ever accurate i will point out that the scientific evidence clearly suggests and the office of technology assessment study indicates that the polygraph shows meaningful scientific evidence of validity when it is focused in the area of investigations of specific criminal activity that is exactly what this amendment focuses upon doing in addition to that the amendment assures the fair conduct of polygraph testing by providing strict regulations on such testing that will guarantee that any polygraph examination that is used under this act will protect not only the rights of the employer but equally the rights of the employee so the legislation before us is what i would call the perfect middle ground no 1 it eliminates the abuse no 2 it eliminates the majority of the exams over 75 percent of the exams would be eliminated or not allowed with this particular amendment and yet it also would be consistent with current government policiessaying if we are going to allow the use of the polygraph in specific incidents and specific cases here within the federal government we would do the same in the private sector i want to point out to my colleagues in closing that this amendment probably has broader support from the outside community than any other amendment that has been offered earlier today or will be offered from here on out it is endorsed by the american retail federation which consists of 24 different groups by the national mass retailing institute the food marketing institute the national grocers association the national association of chain drug stores and the national retail merchants association i would also point out to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that they should be aware that many people in the other body including senator kennedy believe that this approach may be the proper middle ground it bans the use of the polygraph for preemployment testing but it clearly allows the use of the polygraph not as the sole tool but as one of many investigatory tools once a person is on the job there is a specific incident where that person is under reasonable suspicion and yes only when that person has a work history already on board i would encourage my colleagues to accept and support this particular amendment it will make the legislation in front of us much much better i would also suggest it would enhance the chances of enactment a great deal"], [0.5847489237785339,

of the agreement was we could continue supplying the mujahidin the soviets could continue to supply the puppet government but pakistan could no longer be the pipeline through which this aid was going to be going and when we saw the fact that over the last 8i years the puppet government was not a legitimate government in afghanistan and yet had signed on april 14 these accords that were

are responsible for the fact that on april 14 this agreement was signed so that does raise even further concerns for a number of us and i would say for the members that i have and i would like to

pleased to offer it for him at the conclusion of my remarks i will ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment however i think it is important that we have some additional discussion on this subject of burden sharing it is primarily important because i want to inform the members that there has indeed been a substantial and postive indication that at least with respect to our nato allies they recognize the need to give us burden relief i prefer the term burdenrelief rather than burden sharing because debates over burden sharing automatically carried the connotation that one or more parties are not doing their share when you raise that kind of question you are immediately involved in a neverending debate about properly counting contributions and it comes down in some cases to very controversial variety of bean counting that debate is typically very counterproductive in keeping a solid alliance this member wishes to inform his colleagues that the senior senators from the state of delaware the state of georgia the gentleman from new mexico and this member are the four members of congress in a 13member interparliamentary group of nato countries who have been involved for over a year in a north atlantic assembly study entitled nato in the 1990s in this study chaired by the distinguished senator from delaware we also have the assistance of academic experts who made great contributions we have held hearings on both sides of the atlantic and this report will be released on may 10 of this year i think the news contained in this consensus report is really positive and rather amazing especially in light of the fact that on the european side we have great ideological diversity this consensus naa report calls for these kinds of recommendations on burden sharing first it suggests that base negotiations in the future on nato bases involving the united states would be natoized it would not simply be the united states negotiating with greece or with portugal or turkey it would be a matter of nato as an alliance recognizing that it was important to have the united states armed forces located at such bases and involved and supportive in such negotiations second the report recognizes and suggests that the united states should not have to pay for those basesnot directly nor in terms of foreign aid third it makes major suggestions for improvements in strengthening the nato alliance by building a strong european pillar fourth it asks for the nato countries of northern and central europe to make direct financial contributions to meet the needs of less prosperous countries on the southern flank like greece turkey and portugal fifth steps are recommended which would indirectly result in close integration of french and spanish forces into the nato military alliance sixth it provides a variety of recommendations on coordination and cooperation and procuremert seventh among many other significant recommendations it endorses its concept of specialization for the smaller countries in the nato force structure so that in fact they would be more likely to pick up a significantly larger share those recommendations i think are important and significant reasons for optimism that we will see burden relief for the united states if we follow through on this opportunity the gentleman from florida previously said let us not involve ourselves in natobashing yet all of us have concerns about the need for burden relief not only in the far east or the pacific rim but in the nato area i want to commend the distinguished gentlewoman from colorado and the gentleman from florida for their leadership on the burdensharing panel i would say to the gentlewoman my colleague from colorado that the gentleman from new mexico and this member will be asking to make a presentation before your panel on the naa report as soon as it is relcased on may 10 1988 we hope that the members will find it interesting and encouraging and we believe that they will first maintaining our troops in nato at this time is and has been is in our national interest plain and simple every administration for the past four decades has agreed congress on repeated occasions has agreed most academics agree and the american people agreethere seems to be quite a broad consensus that our nato deployments serve our interests indeed even amendments calling for coerceive partial withdrawals of american troops recognize that our overall commitment to nato is vital to our nations security second if there were ever to be an opportune time to withdraw american troops from nato now is not it just the opposite the unitedstates comir itment to nato must now be steacfast and hardy the inf treaty for all its positive aspects has also opened vulnerabilities in nato it makes the perennial conventional imbalance even more glaring a problem to increase the gap between warsaw pact and nato conventional caprbilities at this time is unwise borde ing on dangerous now is the time i o reinvigorate natos conventional forces not to weaken them third furtaermore with new atlantic to the urals conventional arms talks scheduled to start soon we should avoid weakening our nato forces and thereby undermining our negotiating po tion again now is the time to reinvligorate nato conventional forces no to weaken them fourth nato has withstood 39 years worth of various stresses both internal and external because it has dealt with its problems as an alliance as a family of nations united by common ideals and common purposes we all knowj lincolns dictum about the effects of dividing houses it may be an overworked cliche but thats because of its validity the richardson mendment offered by this member is based on the prlrnple that a united foundation in nah is essential for dealing with the challenges which confront the alliance to begin withdrawing unitedstates forces or even threaten such withdrawals no matter how laudable the aim of such threats may be erodes natos unity and its deterrent value to solve its problems while serving as an effective defense alliance nato must not be forced to engage in a hostile internal battle fifth all of this is not meant to whitewash natos problems of which burdensharing although greatly exaggerated by the use of shoddy statistics is an important oae this amendment simply calls for a different approachdealing with the problems while standing strongtogether the issue of burden sharing can best be settled in the friendly relationship we now share with our allies some members seem to think this is not possible congressman richardson and i strongly disagree we were involved over the past year in an interparliamentary nato study group which examined issues confronting nato in the decade ahead the conclusion we drew is that such an approach is entirely possible indeed that it has already begun nato can resolve its internal problems while at the same time presenting the soviets with a robust alliance sixth the burdensharing problem for instance would be greatly alleviated if nato spending were more efficient nato already outspends the warsaw pact however its spending could be used to buy many more goodq if it operated to an increasing extent on a european or north atlanticwide defense market with countries undertaking task specialization and with greater cooperation among the different military establishments seventh there are heartening signs that this has begun france and germany for example have created a joint brigade these are promising signs that the european half of nato has recognized the need to bolster their contribution to nato and has found a route through which to do so i vote that we encourage them in this venture through the richardson amendment which strengthens their confidence in our commitment to the alliance as a whole eighth lets not abandon our own national interests in europe or elsewhere by pointing a gun at our own best friends in the world they already have enough guns aimed at them lets lead the alliance not divide and betray it lets reaffirm our commitment to nato in these trying times we believe that in short maintaining our troops in nato at this time is and has been in our national interest indeed cven amendments calling for coercive partial withdrawal of american troops recognize that our overall commitment to nato is

those that engage in direct investments they are allowed under state law and if we were to halt this practice by this amendment we would weaken the savings and loans the gentleman mentioned some studies that i will have to admit i have not seen i am aware though that a mr scott taylor who was at the time in charge of liquidating failed fslicinsured institutions in a letter he wrote to mr george f rutland chief executive officer of california federal savings and loan association in which he said in the 2 years in which he was in charge of liquidation of failed fslicinsured institutions over 50 institutions were placed in receivership and 26 were so badly scarred that they were being fully liquidated with over 3 2 billion in historical assets he goes on to say that these companies did not fail because of misuse of broader asset and investment powers or because of direct investments in real estate they failed because of fraud incompetence and criminality which was not deterred or detected early enough and which has little if anything to do with the ability to make direct equity investments or with broader asset powers he goes on to say that despite strong assertions by some i can see no basis to claim that direct investment authority is a cause of increased failure or a risk to the fslic i am just saying that the direct investment as a matter of practice as a matter of empirical evidence has made a number of institutions stronger not weaker there is no evidence that that is the genesis of this problem i certainly urge that we defeat this amendment i rise in opposition to the pending amendment and i would like to address a major issue in this debate namely whether direct investments really are riskier than traditional mortgages i dont really know the answer to this question but the crucial point is that neither does the federal home loan bank board so far the bank board has failed to demonstrate that direct investments cause savings and loans to fail what it has done is to resort to some empirical evidence of an association between direct investments and costly failure and to ignore evidence presented by prof george benston of the university of rochester that direct investments have actually reduced the risk of failure in many cases and that even when failed institutions had direct investments n their portfolio they usually made money on them and failed in spite of profitable direct investments an example of the kind of evidence the bank board has chosen to ignore is a letter sent in november 1985 by scott taylor who at the time was in charge of liquidating failed fslicinsured institutions to george rutland chief executive officer of the california federal savings and loan association who had testified in support of deregulation on behalf of the national council of savings institutions mr taylor said that during the 2 years in which he was in charge of liquidations over 50 institutions were placed in receivership and 26 were so badly scarred that they are being fully liquidated with over 3 2 billion in historical assets those compimies did not fail because of misuse of broader asset and investment powers or because of direct investments in real estate they failed because of fraud incompetence and criminality which was not deterred or detected early enough and which has little if anything to do with the ability to make direct investments or with broader asset powers despite strong assertions by some i can see no basis to claim that direct investment authority is a catuse of increased failure or a risk to the

september when we entered into the semiconductor agreement with japan we gave up valuable rights one of which was to pursue two 301 actions and we waive certain penalties that would have accrued to japan and in exchange for that the japanese agreed to open up their markets and not dump products in third countries and in the united states it is obvious that the agreement has been violated the

over the last few months we have been moving rapidly toward a major crisis for metropolitan areas across the country the problem in short are the deadlines in the clean air act enacted 10 years ago because many areas across the country have been unable to meet these deadlines epa will be forced under the act to impose construction bans on at least 14 areas of the country these areas are not little outoftheway places they are among the larger metropolitan areas of the country including los angeles sacramento denver chicago dallas atlanta and cleveland if we do not act today we will be sentencing these areas to severe economic hardships without action similar construction bans will fall on other cities such as new york despite their good faith efforts and progress toward reaching the standards let me emphasize that these bans are nondiscretionary epa cannot administratively avoid imposing them as we have been advised by epas lee thomas in the face of these bans cities and states have come to congress and asked for the relief we should grant them ten years ago when we passed these deadlines we did not know that reaching attainment in some areas would mean eliminating all vehicle traffic or relocating major industries in new york alone the costs of meeting the standards would mean the imposition of extremely unpopular and unworkable restrictions such as requiring alternate driving days gasoline rationing or 20 bridge toll fares in light of this impending disaster the only real meaningful relief we can provide the cities is a vote for the murtha amendment the murtha amendment is superior for several reasons first it would provide congress with a realistic time period to arrive at a more permanent solution to the problem any shorter time period is not only unrealisticit is a sham those who argue that the murtha amendment spells only delay are not being realisticthey are being foolish second and more importantly the murtha amendment would require areas to continue to make progress in reducing pollution this is important we cannot afford to rest in our fight against dirty air the conte amendment although well intended would strip epa of all authority to penalize areas even if they stop making any progress toward clean air the results would be disastrous all around finally i question whether it is fair to give cities less than 21 months we in congress get too used to living on a daytoday even momenttomoment basis at a minimum it is not a pattern we should ask our cities to emulate let us be reasonable and fair and provide a timeframe that we can realistically meet and cities can realistically live with i ask all of my colleagues to vote for the murtha amendment"], [0.0004858970642089844, 0.500485897064209, 1, "i move to strike the last word i was prepared to offer an amendment similar to the amendment presented to this body by the gentleman from illinois but in noticing his amendment in the record i felt that it would be more appropriate to simply lend my support to that effort it seems to me that all of us here have a commitment to the homeless in our society this legislation is an attempt to devote additional resources to take care of those very real needs but in doing so we should not run out and borrow the money we should not run up the deficit clearly if this is a highpriority item and most of us would argue that it is there must be some items in our overall budget that are of a lower priority that we can borrow from that we can reduce in order to make room for funding for this new initiative for the homeless the amendment offered by the gentleman from illinois attempts to present the issue in that fashion to ask us to set some priorities if we are going to spend more in fiscal year 1987 on the homeless then let us find something else in the fiscal year 1987 budget that we can cut in order to take care of these needs i commend my colleagues on the committee on agriculture for keeping that payasyougo principle in mind as they developed their portion of the bill on food assistance because in fiscal year 1987 we do provide the offsets in other spending areas to make sure that any new food aid funds spent in this bill are covered by those other reductions this amendment offered by the gentleman from illinois says that we have to apply that payasyougo approach to the other programs within this legislation i believe that it is really up to the membership here to decide whether we go along with the amendment offered by the gentleman from massachusetts frankly whether we turn it back to the committee on appropriations to look across a broad number of accounts to find some other areas that can be reduced or whether we go specifically into the foreignaid accounts and look there is not the big issue to me the big issue is will we cut in other areas to offset increases in these areas so that overall we do not add to the deficit the principle can be adhered to whether we adopt the frank amendment or whether we adopt the michel amendment as is again i think that this philosophy has to be evident in all of our work this year when we are facing new demands in the area of competitiveness and retraining for workers displaced by unfair trade and as we look at other important needs we cannot solve problems by running up the deficit we cannot solve problems with borrowed money we have to toe the line we have to keep an eye on the bottom line and i think that this amendment deserves our consideration and our support"], [0.0005610287189483643, 0.49943897128105164, 0, "i rise in support of the lowry amendment this is not an easy decision the tough ones never are before focusing on my reasoning i would like to make a comparison when the president asked the congress for authority to send american troops to lebanon that too was a tough decision for all of us but i concluded as did the majority in this body that the united states was coming to grips with a near impossible situation in a practical prudent manner we went to that ravaged nation with the best of intentions as part of an international peacekeeping force we did not go it alone unfortunately and tragically our best intentions were not enough but the cause was worthy we tried but did not succeed and when it became apparent that the direction in which we were proceeding was not going to lead us where we wanted to go the president wisely brought our troops home home too came the italians and the french and the british we had a carefully crafted reasoned policy that earned bipartisan support principally because of the international aspect of the operation in the persian gulf we have something quite different we are uping the ante increasing the risk and going it alone we have special responsibilities in the world community and we must never turn our back on them but where is it written that we have the sole responsibility for everything what is wrong with the concept of burdensharing where are our allies and must we always be the ones who up the ante is there some unwritten rule that every time the soviets blink we nod and how about our position of professed neutrality in the neverending war between iran and iraq up go the flags and down goes the position the riskthat some would have us take wouldfall any serious costbenefit ratio analysis we have heard all the testimony we need to draw that

reduction in the antarctic program and the excessive restraints on the engineering research center and science and technology center programs but these differences pale in comparison with the bedrock support of the entire science space and technology committee for the national science foundation its a little easier every year to explain why we value this agency so highly thats because each year were a little bit more disturbed by problems that we simply cannot solve without the help of nsf for example theres been a great deal of discussion latelysome of it ridiculousabout how to react to the depletion of the ozone layer research funded by nsfmuch of it in the antarcticwill help us determine what additional steps are necessary to stave off the skin cancer crop damage and other ills associated with ozone depletion we in congress talk about the need to modernize our basic manufacturing industries nsf plans to spend almost 51 million on manufacturing research next year much of it as part of joint research projects with industry at engineering research centers we also harp on the need to take the lead in emerging industries nsffunded research has set the international pace in biotechnology and the agency is planning to fund new centers in that field nsf has almost singlehandedly reversed the scandalous inability of american researchers to gain access to supercomputers opening new research frontiers and nsf is in the forefront of the effort to probe superconductivity finally we spend time lamenting the state of american education and bemoaning its effect on our economy nsf is funding teacher training curriculum development and equipment purchases at all levels of education and thanks in part to prodding from our committee the agencys commitment to education

appropriate place and this is the appropriate time to debate and to vote upon a constitutional amendment requiring a federal ly balanced budget as i mentioned earlier i am not talking about a law that we would pass we members of the unitedstates congress because the constitution does not allow us to do that it is not our law we can only propose to the american people a constitutional change which ultimately becomes constitutional law once in place of course we must live with it we must abide by it as members of congress but we cannot pass it out and that is the uniqueness of a constitutional law it is the peoples law they alone by threefourths of the states so ratifying can change the constitution of the united states we can only by a twothirds vote of this body and of the other body propose for ratification that change so in other words when we have a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget we here in the congress cannot change it overnight we cannot say that it is no longer appropriate we cannot live with it and we will waive the provision only the american people can make that decision and as we know on numerous occasions some 26 occasions in the history of this country have we chosen to change the constitution to either add or delete amendments changing the nature in which this government will operate changing the nature in which this congress will operate to me that is critically important not only for the members of the house but for the american public to understand so tonight we are in essence beginning a debate and a discussion that will propose to the american people a change in their law their constitution and if that so changes by a threefourths ratification vote of the 50 states then it becomes the law that will govern us as the gentleman from delaware said and the gentleman from texas then a process will start which will lead us to a balanced budget by the early 1990s 1991 1992 as is so mandated i think that is the essence of what we do here tonight and i think it is most important that we understand that because i have numerous people saying congressman why dont you balance the budget why dont you pass a law we have done that as i said earlier on at least three occasion since the mid1970s this body has passed a law requiring a balanced budget but there is one real and fundamental difference those laws we passed we can change by a majority vote of this house at any time we can gain that vote of those members present and voting but once in the constitution only states can change it only the people of the
