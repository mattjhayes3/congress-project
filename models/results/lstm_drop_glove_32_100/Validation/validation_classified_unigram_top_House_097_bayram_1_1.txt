argument in the face of the plain english words included in the regulation you are not required to inspect and the ftcs promise that no dealer will ever be prosecuted for failing to inspect the

annual observance has several valuable purposes first it gives us the opportunity to show our support and concern for the brave people of the captive nations in their aspirations for freedom selfdetermination and basic human rights second we also have an opportunity to express our outrage and continuing our opposition to soviet expansion and soviet rule over so many people who would surely chose another system of government if they had the chance we have been making these speeches now for 22 years some people have suggested that these speeches are an exercise in futility we cannot roll back the iron curtain we are told just by making speeches on this house floor but the fact is that we are beginning to get results take a look at what has been happening in poland take a look at the achievements of the workers of poland through the solidarity union which has already been able to establish in poland arrangements and procedures that have not occurred in any other communist controlled state who would have believed a few years ago that they could hold a secret ballot election in a soviet satellite state who would have believed that thie position of the communist party boss in poland could ever be in jeopardy at a polish communist party congress as it is this very day these changes have come about because the spirit of freedom has never died in poland and because of the continuing close ties and deep interest with the united states what has happened in poland can also happen in other soviet states recently the house armed services committee visited two other iron curtain countries romania and hungary we were genuinely surprised to see the level of independence that also exists in these countriesnot like what is going on in poland to be sure but still not the stilted frozen framework that might be supposed for example romania has long exercised a very great deal of independence in her foreign policy she is not a member of the warsaw pact she does not permit soviet troops on her soil nor does she permit romania troops to be placed under the command of the officers of any other country moreover the government of romania seeks closer ties with the united states and seeks the benefit of modemn american technology for exa~mple just before our committee arrived in bucharest romania had signed an agreement with the general electric co to have ge in schenectady build two huge turbine generators for two new nuclear power stations in romania they did not turn to the soviet union they turned to schenectady because they wanted quality goods and exercised their independence in making that decision and indeed we hope that romania will continue to turn to america and to the general electric co for the 14 remaining nuclear plants that they intend to build through 1995 from romania we went to hungary and incidentally budapest was one of the most beautiful cities i have ever visited here too we found a great deal of interest on the part of hungarian government and communist party officials which impressed us very much the situation in hungary somewhat differed from what we found in romania hungary is a fullfledged member of the warsaw pact and soviet troops are stationed on hungarian soil hungarian troops maneuver with soviet troops and hungary in contrast to romania does follow the soviet foreign policy line very exactly however when it comes to the operation of hungarian economy they certainly do not follow the igid orthodox communist economic proredures of the soviet union in hungary they have a kind of social democratic type of economy based more on cooperatives than on rigid control from the top as far as we could see there seemed to be a remarkable degree of personal economic freedom which at least appeared to resemble capitalism in many respects and here again the hungarians seek help and close ties with the united states so based on what i have seen in some of these captive nations we do seem to be making progress because americans across our land are this week renewing their commitment to help the captive nations seek freedom of course not all of the captive nations are doing so

aware of the massive debts owed to the federal government and of the enormous amount of this debt that is delinquent mismanagement on the part of bureacrats has permitted these delinquent debts to accumulate the details of the problem are described in the recently issued report of the office of management and budget debt collection project on may 18 1981 the house passed h r 2811 a bill designed to help agencies manage their debts in a more businesslike fashion and to make agency debt collection activities more effective that bill was only one step in the effort to improve debt collection practices and to increase the revenue from delinquent debts because agencies have such a poor track record in managing their debts we must recognize that there may be times when agencies need assistance that is what the bill i have introduced today will do it will authorize and regulate the use of private debt collection agencies by the federal government i hope that use of private debt collectors in appropriate circumstances will increase the repayment of debts owed to the federal government i am convinced that use of these private collectors can be done in a way that is consistent with the right to privacy the rules that govern the contracting out of government functions and the laws that regulate debt collection practices this bill is necessary because it is not clear under present law that agencies have the authority to enter into contracts for debt collection services for many years the general accounting office took the position that federal agencies could not legally delegate the debt collection function to private contractors in order to overcome this restriction congress found it necessary to expressly authorize the use of private debt collectors for a specific category of debts in the education amendments of 1976 public law 94482 i was surprised when the general accounting office and the department of justice reversed this interpretation and amended the regulations for the federal claims collection act the amended regulations require agencies to consider contracting for debt collection services this rule change appeared in the federal register for april 17 1981 no adequate reason for the shift in legal position was cited by the general accounting office and the justice department in the explanation that accompanied the rule change i asked the congressional research service to take a look at the issue of the legality of contracting our for debt collection services crs found no clear legal explanation for the change in the opinion of the general accounting office and the justice department it seems to me that if an activity was once considered to violate federal law then it takes a legislative change in order to make that activity legal neither the comptroller general nor the attorney general has the authority to amend federal statutes because of the tremendous uncertainty engendered by the change to the federal claims collection act regulations we need to clarify the law no agency can responsibly rely on the newly revised rule i am concern ed that any action based on this questionable interpretation will

absolutely no reason that this congress cannot address the real problems facing the social security system and enact comprehensive legislation to restore the financial soundness of this program which serves one out of every seven americans the fact is that social securitys financial problems are not new these problems will not go away the program has been operating in the red for the past 8 years although we have been aware of this congress has not acted to restore the financial integrity of the system h r 4331 as it has come to us from conference falls far short of addressing the basic problems facing social security first with passage of h r 4331 the social security system will continue to accumulate deficits presently the system is losing 12 300 every single minute of every day h r 4331 does not address this fact at all i would like to ask my colleagues how many of them would invest in a system that is losing 12 300 every single minute of every day i do not think any member would voluntarily participate in a program that is operating with a daily deficit of over 17 million yet that is the very extent of the financial problem which the social security system is presently facing we are forcing 115 million working americans to pay taxes into a system that has operated in deficit for 6 years and also faces a deficit as large as 80 billion over the next 5 years second h r 4331 fails to establish a prudent level of trust fund reserve balances on which the system may rely during unanticipated occurrences throughout the past decade trust fund reserve balances have been drained until today they are at their lowest levels ever reserves as a percent of outgo at the beginning of this year just over 2 months of reserves remained in the system this greatly contrasts with the 12year reserve level of 1950 or even with the 1 year reserve level of 1970 now some may feel that it is not essential to have exactly 1 years worth of reserves in the system this point is up to dispute but one thing is certain when the system is drained down to a few months of reserves it becomes vulnerable to unanticipated fluctuations in the economy which may occur the point is that in the past it has been the high trust fund reserve balances which have seen us through unanticipated economic downturns however today with trust fund balances at their lowest level ever we no longer can depend on that cushion i question the prudence of our failure to address this problem in h r 4331 a third consideration that is neglected in this measure before us is the systems longterm deficit over the next 75 years of 1 6 1trillionthis is almost twice our national debt future beneficiaries certainly have much to be concerned about in regard to their benefits since we are aware of this defirit we should responsibly begin coruwideration of steps which insure that we may allow for a smooth phasein of any changes that may be necessary furthermore in 50 years one out of every five americans will be over 65 years of age careful consideration will have to be givenin order to meet the concerns and needs of those who will be retiring in the next century and finally h r 4331 even viewed as a quickfix fails to address the loss of public confidence in the social security system this lack of confidence has resulted ina largedegree from the periodic financial crises that have occurred a new york times cbs poll showed that 54 percent of the american people no longer believe that the social security system will have the money available to pay them the full benefits they would be entitled to at retirement for those polled 25 to 34 years of age 75 percent doubted that social security will provide full benefits for their own retirement we must provide for longterm reforms that put the system on firm financial ground in this way we can assure the 115 million contributors to the system and the present 36 milion beneficiaries that they will be able to depend on social security in their time of need as a base of financial support and so i believe it comes down to a question of congressional responsibility unfortunately congress has not acted responsibly in overseeing the social

adequately gets the deficit figures down to a range that i consider acceptable without any action on the budget we are facing a projected deficit for fiscal year 1983 of 181 8 billion the latta budget provides a deficit of 99 billion in fiscal year 1983 the jones budget deficit figures of 107 billion for filcal year 1983 and that figure is arrived at in part by assuming increased revenues of 31 billion in fiscal year 1983 these figures are unrealistic there is no way that revenue increases of that magnitude can be achieved by the house committee on ways and means in an election year it will be difficult if not impossible for the committee to raise revenues by 20 billion given this scenario the jones budget would have a deficit projection closer to 118 billion i do have some serious

particular interests in federal programs which affect handicapped children and disabled adults it is my underatanding that the assumptions in the latta substitute for function 500 include 50 000 000 more in fiscal year 1983 for education of handicapped children over the 1982 baseline an 8 6percent increase over 1982 for vocational rehabilitation this would provide for an appropriation of 1 029

for chapter i of the education consolidation and improvement act this chapter deals with compensatory education further the latta substitute assumes an addon of 78 million to the current level of funding for chapter ii of the ecia which is the block grant approved last year while these addons represent only a partial restoration of cuts made during the 1981 reconciliation process i feel that they reflect concern for disadvantaged children and their need for compensatory education similarly i support the latta substitute assumption of a 109 million addon for pell grants this too reflects support for our nations needy collegebound students while i personally would prefer to see larger addons the economic conditions that our nation faces prevent it the addons in the latta substitute do

illadvised irresponsible and untimely bill brought to the house floor in my 4 years in congress the problems with this legislation and indeed with the entire sentiment resulting in the domestic content approach are far too numerous for me to discuss in detail i will be brief there can be no doubt that the problems of the domestic auto industry are extremely serious the historic importance of the auto industry to the health of our entire economy cannot be overstated the human social and economic costs of thousands of unemployed autoworkers and auto industry supply workers are tragically high it is therefore not difficult to understand and sympathize with the motives of the proponents of the bill unfortunately in attempting to solve some of the problems of the auto industry domestic content advocates if successful will have created problems both domestic and international of such magnitude that those of the auto industry will be dwarfed by restricting japanese imports beginning in 1984 this legislation is intended to create as many as 100 000 new jobs in auto and autorelated industries by 1990 the congressional budget office however estimates that any jobs created would be offset by the elimination of nearly twice as many jobs in other industries real gnp would be 0 1 percent lower by 1990 and inflation would be 0 2 percent higher than now projected international trade is not a oneway street as many as one unitedstates job in e ery five is linked directly or indirectly to unitedstates exports protectionist legislation of this sortlegislation which violates in spirit and practice the international trading rules developed largely by the unitedstates since world war iican only result in retaliatory actions by our trading partners although it is true that in some areas unitedstates access to important foreign markets is now restricted it is extremely shortsighted to move further away from the free trade philosophy that has so contributed to the economle success of the united states and our trading partners over the past 30 years if domestic con ent legislation is enacted for cars other distressed industries such as textiles and steelwhere limited import restrictions already existwill not be far behind the danger is clear in attempting to preserve jobs in detroit we are risking a global decline in trade employment and economic wellbeing the japanese are not responsible for detroits problems in fact the japanese should perhaps be commended for manufacturing and making available to american consumers quality automobiles that are greatly desired because of price and performance if this legislation passes those japanese cars that remain available will be much more expensive without the price competition of imports unitedstates cars will increase in cost as well the ultimate result american consumers will pay more for a reduced variety of auto models again japanese imports are not responsible for the problems of our domestic auto industry to restrict such imports would be to increase costs for unitedstates consumers to increase unemployment in other unitedstates industries and to reduce global economic activity why then is this legislation even being seriously considered the answer i think can only be that the uaw has used its considerable political clout at a time when protectionist sentiment though misguided is understandably rising to prevail upon some members of this body to do something and in this instance it is certainly easier to blame the japanese than to address the real causes of our auto industry problems japanese imports have achieved success in the unitedstates market because they meet consumer demand the domestic industry has frankly not been as creative has not done as good a job in anticipating changes in the market and has not proven as successful in maintaining quality and limiting cost labor management and the federal government all bear part of the blame all will have to work together to improve the situation recent signs are encouraging unitedstates cars have improved in quality and design and sales are up labor costs are growing less rapidly the federal government is showing more flexibility in the regulatory area as our entire economy moves out of recession the pentup demand for new cars may result in extremely high sales the recent performance of unitedstates auto company stocks is indicative of wall streets expectation of a profitable recovery we must therefore continue to work for economic recovery we must focus on detroits internal problems we must

which is more critical to our survival as a nation and as a civilization last year i introduced two resolutions calling for the elimination of all nuclear weapons the first house concurrent resolution 7 was introduced on january 5 and the second revised resolution house concurrent resolution 151 was dropped in the hopper with the cosponsorship of mr binoham in june both express the sense of the congress that all nuclear weapons should be eliminated the processcalling on the president to negotiate immediate substantial reductions in nuclear weapons on a bilateral basis with the soviet union subject of course to verificationis the same in both resolutions further the resolutions urge the president to call for an international conference of all nations with nuclear weapons in order to plan for the phased reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons througout the world house concurrent resolution 151 has over 60 cosponsors the freeze resolutions which have been introduced by many of my colleagues have over 100 cosponsors the people of the united states have also made it clear that they are concerned with the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear war recent surveys indicate that americans believe we should reduce nuclear arms i strongly believe that the only way to eliminate the threat of nuclear war is to remove the means of creating this ultimate disaster this is the goal which we all shareboth those that advocate a freeze and those who support negotiated reductions if it is true that the united states has a sufficient deterrent force to prevent a soviet nuclear attack then a freeze would be a viable option if on the other hand we would lose bargaining power and increase the threat of a nuclear war or political blackmail due to soviet superiority then we should consider negotiating to a level of equal deterrence before initiating a freeze i urge my colleagues on the foreign affairs committee to debate these critical issues in order to provide an opportunity for the house to express its views on reducing nuclear weapons i am extremely encouraged by the introduction of a resolution by foreign affairs committee chairman clem zablocki calling for strategic arms talks and verifiable negotiated reductions in soviet and american nuclear weapons his leadership on this issue is vital i am also gratified that president reagan plans to endorse bilateral negotiations to reduce nuclear weapons it appears that his statement may parallel the resolution introduced by senators jackson and warner calling for a freeze at equal and greatly reduced levels of nuclear forces i believe we should go beyond all of these proposalsto the actual elimination of all nuclear weapons even the least deadly warhead in use today is thousands of times more powerful than the bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki the destruction that would occur can be illustrated with an example that is very close to homethe consequences of dropping a nuclear bomb on the capitol imagine that we are sitting in this hallowed chamber debating vital questions of the day suddenly the civil defense alarm sounds it emergency call12 bells ring

light and all of capitol hill would collapse under a supersonic shock wave and winds of 300 to 600 miles per hour a similar fate would befall all living things around the perimeter of the beltway from the center of downtown washington to capitol hill everything would be vaporized leaving a crater several hundred feet deep a fireball over 1 mile in diameter would be created and would incinerate at a temperature of over 20 000 degrees farenheit anything that stood in it path within a 10mdie radius the vast majority of the metropolitan areas population would be killed by the blast wave 200mileperhour winds and fires over 40 percent of those left barely alive would suffer severe burns radiation sickness and traumatic in iuries since most medical facilitites would be destroyed and transportation would be impossible survivors would have no medical care food or water they would die a painful and lingering death as the fire from the bombs could turn into a 1 200squaremile firestorm cooking and asphyxiating even those in shelters survivors would be exposed to fallout and many would die within 2 weeks some may think that many people survived hiroshima and nagasaki and could survive a modern attack but the single bomb dropped on those cities had an explosive force of 15 000 tons of tnt the largest bomb today has the force of 20 million tons of tnt and even the smallest that would be used in nuclear war has the force of 1 million tons of tnt an allout nuclear attack with the launching of over 40 000 weapons by the united states and the soviet union would

section 5 is perfect but now the judiciary committee would bar richmond from bailout because we made a cooperative agreement to avoid going broke if anything diluted voting rights it was the justice

tripling its present work load some proponents of section 3 have claimed that 700 000 businesses would be added it is hard to believe that the supporters of a clean environment would choose to divert

that would be affected include 56 000 gas stations 14 000 auto repair garages 6 000 dry cleaners and 2 000 hospitals as well as most high schools and virtually every college and university in the nation several of the members of this body from time to time express a concern for small businesses well there is nothing worse you could do for a small business than to add a minimum of 3 000 every year to their costs yet that is what section 3 would do finally some proponents of section 3 have raised concerns about small quantities of toxic wastes yet the epa already has a 1kilogram limit for highly toxic wastes i even read about threats of kepone dumping in open landfills well let me assure my colleagues speaking from the state that made kepone a household word it is no longer manufactured in the united states and its use has been banned for many years in short section 3 represents a bludgeon approach against untold numbers of small businessmen and schools to solve a problem the magnitude of which we are not certain but which certainly could be addressed in a more humane and costeffective way i urge my colleagues to support the pending amendment"], [0.00025206804275512695, 0.5002520680427551, 1, "i rise in support of the resolution the tennessee valley authority in approving a plan to pay some of its managers up to 36 000 tier year above their current salary if they agree to stay with tva for 3 years has raised some very serious questions as my colleagues have pointed out tva employees are federal employees and are subject to the statutory pay cap the extra payments for agreeing to remain with tva would place the compensation of these employees above the pay cap it would also be above the salary received by the authoritys board of directors yet section 3 of the tva act provides that employees shall not receive a salary in excess of that paid members of the board the resolution directs tva to formally request from 0mb and congress any amendments to law relating to compensation of employees it considers necessary it also directs tva not to implement any program which would have the effect of providing compensation to any employee in excess of the federal pay cap this will insure that our committee and the congress will have an adequate opportunity to examine this important matter and to take appropriate action i urge passage of the resolution"], [0.0002557039260864258, 0.4997442960739136, 1, "i believe it will only take 10 minutes on my amendment5 minutes for me to explain my amendment 5 minutes for the gentleman from alabama to respond then we can have a vote on my amendment on the tennesseetombigbee waterway let me just indicate to you the status we lost by a very few votes the pritchard amendment which was an attempt to eliminate all funding for the tennesseetombigbee waterway the amendment which i have pending simply reduces the funding of that project to 100 million for fiscal year it leaves in the project more money than any other water project in the nation in fact my amendment will provide for 13 million more than is spent on the nearest closest project which is lock and dam 26 as we have just determined by an action of the house the house on this particular day does not want to kill the project for two specific reasons i believe that this project can proceed with the reduction of 89 million let me state them very quickly first the court of appeals has enjoined a major section of the project therefore a great portion of the project will not need the kind of funding that was anticipated in placing 189 million in the project and second and probably more impdrtantly there is responsibility on the part of the states involved the communities involved to have a certain amount of costsharing let me quote for my colleagues a statement that is found on page 88 of the gao report of may 1981 under alternative financing is a possibility it states we believe during this period when there is enormous pressure to reduce federal spending if the concern of the congress is the remaining federal expenditure exploring alternative arrangements to finance the incomplete segments of tenntomn may be worthwhile while it was not within the scope of our review to examine alternative financing we feel this is a possibility some methods that come to mind include states or others could borrow funds from the federal ooverrnent and repay through user charges alabama and mississippi could issue longterm bonds and repay through user charges alabama and mississippi could finance portions of the project through general revenue funds i indicated in earlier debate in hopes of supporting the pritchard amendment that david stockman spoke in the well of the house just a year ago in opposition to this project i had indicated that all over the country there is concern about federal spending and we have had editorial endorsements from everywhere indicating the need to reduce federal funding and particularly reduce it for the tennesseetomblgbee waterway my amendment in short leaves 100 million does not impact on the amendment offered by the gentleman from indiana mr myaas in fact it includes the increase of 9 million offered by the gentleman and it is an opportunity for those membersmany of w~hom supported completion of the tennesseetombigbee waterwayto say that maybe it is more appropriate for us to spend close to 10 million a month rather than spending close to 20 million a month i urge my colleagues to reduce the funding to 13 million above the funding for any other project in the nation to fund it at 100 million and to return 89 million to the federal treasury"]]}
