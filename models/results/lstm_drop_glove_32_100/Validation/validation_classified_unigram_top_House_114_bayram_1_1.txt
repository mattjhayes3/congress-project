there is about 8 pounds of bill over there at a secure location as i spoke of before that i cant talk about it in public because i am precluded from doing that i would violate the rules of the house and the classified status that has been accorded that material so i cant really talk about it i can say that it is very complicated like i say there is probably i am guessing about 8 pounds of document there that you have to read it is largely aspirational in other words i will paraphrase without disclosing any classified information it largely says the parties will aspire or engage to do blah blah blah it is largely unenforceable here is another part of the problem we are negotiating the biggest multinational trade agreement in the history of the united states you have got some countries that i think are reliable partners and that we have a history with canada even before free trade agreements we had trade agreements with canada they have the rule of law there it is not a race to the bottom with canada or with australia or with new zealand i think we have rule of law established in those countries but we also in the same agreement are negotiating with vietnam i went to vietnam not long ago and when we talked issues i sat down across the table from a bunch of communist generals they run the country they have problems with prison labor they have problems with child labor they have serious problems with environmental standards in that country malaysia do you know what the minimum wage in malaysia is zero they do that to try to attract companies the situation in chile and peru we have organizers that have tried to work on behalf of workers who have been killed in those countries there is no rule of law established in those countries where we have had success in enforcing our agreements that has been a major problem so we are going to ask the american worker to compete with workers in vietnam who get i think it is 90 cents an hour 97 cents an houri dont want to sell them short97 cents an hour in a country that has had a history of major problems as i have spoken about malaysia the same thing we cant enforce our agreements and on the issue of who has drafted this bill it is my understanding that the chemical industry provisions in that tpp were drafted by the chemical industry they like it they got exactly what they wanted the same thing with these other industries and again why is it a national secret that i cant talk about a bill that is going to affect every american citizen today and not only that it is going to affect their sons and daughters there is a reason that our kids coming out of college cant get jobs we have got to wake up i told this story before i went to korea recently with jpac it was about the korean war and recovering our sons and daughters who fought in that country and are still there but while i was there i looked for american cars because we had passed a free trade agreement with korea we were there for days i had two young navy lieutenants with me i said lets all look for american cars we saw two american cars in the time we were there in korea it is a big industrial country they have got plenty of traffic we saw hundreds of thousands of cars i saw two american cars the one i was driving in from the embassy and the one that the navy lieutenants were driving in behind me they have shut us out you go to japan it is pretty much the same story i said before you need to hire a detective to find an american car in japan so we have had very little success in enforcing our trade agreements overseas we have got a lousy deal so all i am asking is look i believe inand you know what i have to say the eu did it right the eu when they negotiated with south korea they said if you are going to sell cars into the eu from korea we want 30 percent of the components in that car to be made in the eu and they created a lot of work for their auto parts industry think about it we could do that congress could do that we could maintain that if they are going to sell a foreign car here we want 40 percent or 50 percent of the components to be manufactured here in the united states we would create millions of jobs in the united states there is nothing wrong with that it is a good thing we would restore industrial and manufacturing capacity in the united states if congress got back in the game i am not against free trade i think free trade works when it is balanced i want somebody in there fighting for the american worker we dont have that now we dont have that now congress has abdicated its responsibility by agreeing to buy a pig in a poke because when they bring that bill back on the floor here we are going to have to vote up or down you wont have the ability to change the bill like you do on every other bill that is brought on the floor of congress you will not have that ability congress will have abdicated its responsibility to represent the people that sent them here free trade can work lets have a fair deal for the american worker that is all i am asking for if there were a fair deal for the american worker that i could read and talk to my constituents aboutyou know i have got 727 514 bosses back in massachusetts and they sent me here to do my job and i am trying to do that on their behalf i think that every other member of congress is trying to do their job as well we cant do that if tpa goes through we need to give the american worker a voice and we can do that today lets vote this stuff down lets talk to the president he is a good man wants to create american jobs lets have an open debate it should not be a secret it should not be a national secret about these agreements we are having with multinational corporations we should not be afraid that the american people might find out what is going on here we should be proud of what we are doing here we should want it plastered all over the front pages of the newspapers in this country we should be proud of our work here i cant be proud of what is going on right now and so i urge my colleagues to vote against it vote this down lets change this system to a transparent system that the american

committee on rules for the customary 30 minutes i rise in opposition to this structured rule which provides for the consideration of h r 4498 the socalled helping angels lead our startups act otherwise known as the halos act i also oppose the underlying legislation unless through the amendment process we can improve it the gentleman from texas said something that i agree with it is important for congress to act i think where we differ is act on what what should congress be acting on right now should we be talking about this or should we be talking about other things quite frankly that are much more important to this country and to the american people four days from now puerto rico faces a 422 million debt payment given the items listed for consideration in the house this week it appears as though the republican majority has no plans to act on legislation to address the debt crisis in puerto rico i understand that my republican friends in the majority are having a difficult time in coming to an agreement within their conference on how to move forward but i urge my colleagues to continue working with leader pelosi and ranking member grijalva toward a bipartisan solution that allows puerto rico to restructure its debt this is a big deal the senate is waiting for us to act the people of puerto rico are waiting for us to act and our constituents are waiting for us to act rather than acting on that which is urgent we are doing this another thing we might want to think about acting on and is an area in which the house republican leadership has also failed to act is that of the public health emergency created by the zika virus this is a big deal it is the public health the wellbeing of our citizens is a big deal or at least it should be but you would never know it if you are following the proceedings on the house floor my colleague from new york congresswoman lowey has an emergency supplemental bill to help to fund what is necessary to protect our people from this virus but we are told that is on the back burner what about doing something in response to the terrible tragedy that unfolded in flint michigan where that community was poisoned by the water that came out of their faucets why arent we addressing that emergency by the way flint is not unique unfortunately there are other places across this country where the levels of lead in the drinking water are unacceptably high are dangerously high we need to make sure that our infrastructure in this country is up to the point at which people dont have to worry about drinking the water that comes out of their faucets we should be addressing that issue but for some reason we dont have the time there are lots of young people here who are visiting the capitol this week why arent we doing something about student financial aid so that people can afford to go to college creating a situation by which young people who go to college are debt free when they get out of college lowering the interest rates on college loans or eliminating the interest rates on college loans thus making college more affordable that is a huge priority that is important but we dont have time to talk about that here in the peoples house this congress also continues to shirk its constitutional duty to vote on an authorization for the war against isis in the past week the pentagon announced that the united states will send 250 more troops to syria and 200 more to iraq in iraq alone the official number of unitedstates troops is now over 4 000 but this house still cant seem to find time to debate and vote on an aumf i have great reservations about the presidents policy with regard to these wars i think we ought to debate those wars and i think we ought to go on record as voting to authorize those wars instead we dont want to talk about it we are putting the lives of young american men and women in harms way we are sending them halfway across the world to be engaged in an effort in my opinion in which there is not a clearly defined mission we are not living up to our constitutional responsibility which is we ought to debate and deliberate and vote on these wars that is our constitutional responsibility and we are not doing it we dont have the time or maybe we are just too cowardly to be able to tackle some of these important issues the american people are tired of endless wars and it is our responsibility to debate these escalations that continue to invest more american tax dollars add more firepower and put more unitedstates troops closer to the front lines but again this leadership isnt focused on these very serious situations that call for immediate action just so you know we are not paying for most of these wars while my friends like to talk about our debt i would point out that most of these wars are unpaid for they just go on the credit card we dont even have the guts to have a vote on whether to pay for these wars instead we are doing this today 2 weeks ago house republicans missed the legally mandated deadline for congress to enact a budget and it appears as though we are not going to see a budget resolution on the floor this week or anytime soon on the most pressing issues facing our country today my friends in the republican majority have failedand they have failed miserablyto do their job plain and simple so what is the house debating today what is so urgent to debate today that all of these other things can be put to the side we are debating legislation the socalled halos act that will undo an important investor protection that democrats fought to include in the 2012 jobs act i supported the jobs act which expanded opportunities for small business capital formation since the jobs act became law in 2012 companies have raised roughly 71 billion of capital by using the new general solicitation and advertising exemption 1245 but it is important to balance our desire for capital formation with their need to protect investors

important this is about american jobs about how we can rebuild the american economy and about how we can at the same time provide employment opportunitiesthose middle class jobs that we all want to talk aboutand do it in a way that actually improves our environment today i want to focus on one part of this i have asked some of my colleagues to join us and congresswoman hahn will be joining us in a few moments to talk about a piece of this in the make it in america agenda we have these items international trade which is critically important that we do right tax policies of all kinds our energy policy oh by the way in the last 5 years the energy policy of the administrations has almost made the united states energy independent we are actually producing 4 billion more barrels of oil a day now than we were 6 or 7 years ago so we do have an energy policygreen energy moving away from the greenhouse gasses a labor policy education the training of our workers research which is critically important we may come to that later today but i really want to focus on this one which is at the bottom because it is foundational the foundation of the economy of the united states is the infrastructure way way back the founding fatherseverybody around here wants to talk about the founding fathers and what the founding fathers would do and how they would act i will tell you what george washington did in his first weeks in office he turned to alexander hamilton the treasury secretary and said hey alex develop an economic development plan for me how are we going to grow our economy treasury secretary hamilton came backhe formed a committee of one and he came back with a plan of maybe 30 40 pages and in that plan was fundamental infrastructure development he said the role of the federal government is to make sure that we have postal roads to make sure that we have ports and canalsthe infrastructure of the day so for those who like to harken back to the founding fathersthey ought to also consider the mothers in any case infrastructure was fundamental today i want to talk about infrastructure and i want to do it in a way that will really hopefully excite this body into passing a very robust complete surface transportation infrastructure bill now president obama and department of transportation secretary foxx have made a proposal called build america it is a good proposal that covers all of the elements that we needthe highways the ports the railroads freight all of those things are in that bill unfortunately it didnt have a hearing last year hopefully it will be foundational this year as we consider in the next 3 months a surface transportation infrastructure bill for the united states because in may the world comes to an end as the programs of the federal governments for transportation expire we need a new law going forward so what we want to talk about today is that issue i am going to take just a few seconds every now and then somebody sends brochures and studies to us this one came from duke university the center on globalization governance competitiveness infrastructure investment creates american jobs and they have got this little executive summary which is really helpful to us old and broken transportation infrastructure makes the united states less competitive than 15 of our major trading partners and makes american manufacturers less efficient in getting goods to market representative hahn that is where you want to come in and talk about ports this is duke university the underinvestment of infrastructure costs the united states over 900 000 jobs including 97 000 american manufacturing jobs maximizing americanmade materials when rebuilding infrastructure has the potential to create even more jobs relying on americanmade inputs can also mitigate safety concerns related to largescale outsourcing one of the things that really really bothers me about my home state of california is the way in which the state of california decided to build the san franciscooakland bay bridge we are talking about a multibilliondollar project 3 9 billion over budget 12 years late and the steel in that bridge came from china how brilliant was that one of the principal reasons for the delay was the steel was delayed the steel was faulty and the welds were faulty there were 3 000 jobs in china and zero jobs in the united states by the way the chinese demanded that they be the inspectors on the jobnot good at all this kind of tells us about why making it in america is important there is another example i dont like to brag about new york since that is a long long way from my district but the tappan zee bridge in new york was built with american steel had a 3 9 billion total project cost 7 728 american workers were hired and it was designed to last 100 years without any major structural maintenance i know ms hahn is going to come up here and probably carry on some bragging we have got a lot to brag about in california but we cannot brag about what happened with the san franciscooakland bay bridge because it was a financial disaster it was a jobs disaster for the united states for american workers even today there are continuing reports coming out about the faulty bridge construction infrastructure investment creates american jobs and if we require that those investments be made in america we are

scourge of our society is estimated to be a 9 billion industry in the united states and as much as a 30 billion industry worldwide all of the criminals and all of those who wish to do wrong realize that it is a bigger and better business than drugs because tragically and unfortunately and with great sadness they use their product over and over again they use these innocent persons many women many children many boys over and over again because this criminal activity rarely occurs in public view it is difficult to say exactly how many children are being victimized what we do know however is that the problem is extensive all you have to do is walk along any of the streets of major cities and find homeless teenagers or even younger than that and you will find out that in some way they have been tainted and touched and brutalized by sex trafficking an estimated 290 000 american children are at risk of becoming victims of sex trafficking the national center for missing and exploited children estimates that one of every seven endangered runaways who reported to the center are likely victims of minor sex trafficking i am told that the average age of minors entering the sex trade is

especially vulnerable child victims of sex trafficking can and do come from a type of home or socioeconomic background that makes them particularly if you will in the line of fire the bottom line however is that all of these children are deserving of rescue recovery protection and shelter one of the advocacies that i had in my own hometown was to provide for children in foster care that had aged out because those are likely victims unbeknownst to themselves and they are worthy of saving the bill before us h r 350 the human trafficking prevention intervention and recovery act of 2015 is

in the prevention of trafficking this study along with the mandated gao will provide muchneeded intelligence to be shared among those federal state and local agencies dedicated to combating sex trafficking and might i add that what is also needed is a commitment an investment of resources to not just have the studies but to make sure that we match the importance of this legislation with resources witnesses testified at a homeland security committee field hearing in houston in march of last year which i convened and brought members of congress to houston for which has a particularly

is long overdue this bill also addresses a major concern that anti trafficking advocates have shared with methe lack of housing or shelter for survivors trafficked kids need a way out someplace to escape without such refuge these children will return to their traffickers and their traffickers will be waiting for them this bill provides funding for local shelters so they get the support they need to house survivors and to get these young people started on the path to recovery today we are considering several bills that address domestic minor sex trafficking and it is right that we do all we can to protect our children most statistics indicate that the average age of a female when she is first victimized in human trafficking is a very young year of age with this fact alone we can

114th congress i am thrilled to have her partnership in this caucus and i look forward to working with her several years ago my good friend and former republican colleague from missouri jo ann emerson and i founded the house hunger caucus as a forum for members to discuss advance engage and work on issues related to domestic and international hunger and food insecurity over the years the house hunger caucus has hosted a number of briefings on topics ranging from introductions to the major domestic and international hunger programs to food deserts in rural and urban america to global agriculture and farmertofarmer initiatives to international school feeding and child nutrition programs just to name a few the caucus doesnt just look at existing programs it also gets involved in emergency responses as they are unfolding in 2011 during one of the worst droughts in recent memory the house hunger caucus held timely briefings on the unitedstates response to the famine in the horn of africa members and staff were able to hear directly from those on the ground providing assistance to deal with this unprecedented crisis one of the most important objectives of the house hunger caucus is to foster better communication among antihunger advocates by bringing together stakeholders from federal agencies state and local governments nonprofits faithbased organizations academia and business to discuss longterm strategies for ending hunger the caucus also serves as a vehicle for antihunger organizations to communicate directly to congress about hunger and food insecurity issues one of my top priorities for the house hunger caucus this year is to make sure we hear directly from those who have experienced hunger and poverty firsthand we need to make sure that their voices are heard in the discussions here in washington one of the greatest assets of the house hunger caucus is that it is bipartisanrepublicans and democrats it is a way for members to come together to work to end hunger there is not a congressional district in the united states of america that is hungerfree not a single one according to the usda more than 17 5 million american households were food insecure in 2013 meaning that their access to adequate food was limited by a lack of money or other resources 5 6 percent of households were considered to have very low food security in other words those households were hungry hunger disproportionately affects the most vulnerable among us children seniors and the disabled last year 16 million children or one in five experienced hunger and increasingly veterans and military families are experiencing hunger on the international side about 805 million people in the world or one in nine suffer from hunger according to the most recent u n reports this is a decrease of 100 million over the past decade and 209 million since the early 1990s the unitedstates can be proud of its leadership in reducing global hunger and addressing the root causes of food insecurity through partnerships with other nations international organizations our own farmers ngos and private sector communities we are advancing agricultural development increasing child nutrition reducing malnutrition among infants and children empowering small farmers around the globe especially women and providing nutritious meals in school settings while the journey is long we now have a proven and coordinated set of programs that effectively address global hunger as we reestablish the house hunger caucus i cant think of a better location to launch it at than d c central kitchen a unique antihunger organization that prepares 5 000 meals a day for more than 80 local nonprofit partners helping those going through tough times one of d c central kitchens greatest strengths is its culinary jobs training program where men and women who have faced the most difficult of situationshomelessness addiction or incarcerationparticipate in a rigorous job training program to prepare for

arkansas were right to send him to congress not only does he come ready to identify the spending problems that this country has but he comes ready with solutions too and i think that is in essence the definition of leadership i thank the gentleman i also thank the gentleman from georgia who just spoke he speaks so eloquently on so many subjects a member of the rules committee i am also very appreciative of his contribution to the budget committee he of course as we all are today and almost every day unfortunately was talking about the debt and let me just put it in a pictorial form this is the new red menace look at that trajectory it goes nearly vertical so the question is how do you turn that big ship that titanic if you will so number one it doesnt sink this entire country and number two it gets on a more meaningful more productive course so that we can continue to be the worlds best hope in a 21st century world now some especially those on the other side of the aisle will immediately turn to the fact that there are two ways to in fact solve this problem one is to control spending the other is to grow revenue let me talk about the latter for just a second the latter is a false choice because at 10 000 people a day retiring into unreformed social programs that trajectory will not turn around it will not plateau no matter how much property you confiscate from the american people no matter how much you take in the form of taxes with 10 000 people a day retiring in unreformed programs can you get that to go down so lets look at that more closely this is what the federal government confiscates from the american people to run itself in fiscal year 2015 it was 3 25 trillion revenue we took in to run the operations of just the federal government the american people know we dont have a revenue problem we have a spending problem the question should be what cant you do what cant you do with 3 25 trillion of property confiscated more revenue is not the answer thankfully the majority here in the house of representatives doesnt think it is the answer either we know we can do better we know we have to do better for the american people we know we have to control the spending that is why i am very proud to be part of a committee the budget committee and part of a new crew that came starting in 2011 that for every year we have put in a budget a narrative something that we dont legally have to do as part of the budget process but we took the extra step to put a narrative in our budget to give the solutions that are needed to correct this debt problem reforming medicare reforming medicaid putting us on a track that will reduce that red menace that will plateau it and start pointing it downward over the next generation we took the political risk to have that conversation with the american people and we have done it every year since 2011 some people called it the third rail of politics touch it and you will be politically electrocuted well we touched it and we touched the next year and the next year and the year after that and my hope and my pledge is on this house floor that we will continue to have that conversation with the american people backed up with votes that show really how to solve this problem i will refer us to the spending that i am talking about this chart was used before by the gentleman from arkansas i will refer to it again here is what is on autopilot here is what needs to be reformed and if you look at one piece of that pie there medicaid a solution for that has been in our budget for the last 5 years in the remaining time i have i want to talk about that solution a state flexibility grant block grant if you will we have had that idea in our budget for the last 5 years it is the idea that we in the federal government we are going to get out of the business of medicaid we are going to get out of the business of deciding who is poor in terms of health care what the poor need in terms of health care or how the poor get it that health care service we are going to give it to the states to individuals to locally elected officials people who know their communities better in fact than any federal bureaucrat does people who can determine given a finite amount of money from us their money back in fact what the poor need who the poor really are who the disabled really are what they should get in terms of healthcare services and how they should get it maybe like the gentleman from arkansas alluded to earlier maybe there ought to be a work requirement for the ablebodied ones of them maybe there ought to be other conditions but let the states decide what that would be pressured in a good way by the fact that there would only be a finite amount of money coming from our budget that would allow us to know exactly what we are in for as a federal government exactly what we are giving out and not a cent more and would naturally incentivize the states to innovate to come up with better ways of service to serve those who really need health care who cant get it any other way and those who in fact are gaming the system will be naturally forced off the states are in the best position to provide that when they are properly incentivized with a finite amount of money that doesnt grow over time the republican budget for the last 5 years the one that has passed this house of representatives has done that very thing we are on the right track we need to continue these votes we need to continue to have a budget we need to continue to have standalone votes on these reforms to take this issue to the american people especially in a presidential election year when frankly the candidates i havent seen them talk enough about what is really on peoples minds and that is how they are going to leave their children and grandchildren with a better life than they have when we are knowingly saddled with 19 trillion in debt a very hard thing to do in fact i think this is the first generation in

preparing for maybe this to be the pinnacle of their career i get why someone in that situation would not want to do it our proposal says okay lets do term limits but then we will phase it in as new

with some of the members that have misgivings i think my friend from iowa points out i mean if this were something that were to be done via article v of the constitution and submitted through the states around congress that would be enacted in a new york minute i mean that will sail through every state legislature without question and you would end up having term limits so i think there are

their service not just for this country but for the freedom and democracy around the world of others the gravity of the attacks raise serious questions regarding the unitedstates presence in benghazi libya particularly as those questions related to the policies decisions and activities of the administration and relevant executive branch agencies before during and after the attacks for nearly 2 years congress sought answers to these questions however the administrations valid response has exposed the limits encountered by our standing committees these responses revealed a less than competent or transparent accounting about the attacks consequently the house created with the support of our democratic colleagues the select committee on the events surrounding the 2012 terrorist attacks in benghazi libya everywhere i go i have people ask me what is taking so long what is taking so long for us to get the facts about what happened in benghazi we are going to do our best today to explain to the american people and to the public and to you why it has taken so long why it is requiring us to continue to subpoena and beg and plead for the information that we need to be able to deliver

have been directed by the house to conduct a complete investigation across the spectrum of all all all relevant executive branch agencies and issue a definitive final report on the events surrounding

personnel abroad and any other relevant issues relating to the attacks the response to the attacks or the investigation by the house of representatives into the attacks i think that number nine is a particularly relevant point it says all other relevant issues that is one of the questions that we have been receiving are we stepping out of bounds on what this committee was supposed to do the answer is absolutely not using these instructions as a guide the committee requested and reviewed a substantial volume of information that was previously produced to the house and new information never before produced to congress the committee has reviewed more than 20 000 pages of emails and documents produced by the state department never before released to congress this new material includes emails that were sent to or received by the former secretary of state relevant to benghazi as well as documents and emails that were part of the state departments accountability review board proceedings in addition hundreds of pages of emails never before seen by congress have been produced by the white house the department of justice and the intelligence community have also produced documents never before seen by congress further the committee has interviewed executive branch personnel including survivors of the benghazi terror attacks none of whom have ever been interviewed by previous committees the committee has also interviewed others who have been able to provide indispensable firsthand details of the unitedstates presence in benghazi libya we know that this is not a complete universe of information held by the executive branch our investigation has uncovered new witnesses new documents and new facts related to the benghazi terror attacks ironically the largest impediment to getting this investigation done in a timely manner and being able to write a final definitive accounting of what happened before during and after the terrorist attacks in benghazi is the executive branch itself the committee has issued letters subpoenas has threatened to hold and has held public compliance hearings with slow to little to no action at all take the state department for examplethe state department is a necessary focus of this investigation yet their compliance posture with the committee and congress has proved unpredictable at best when this committee was formed 1 year ago the state department had yet to fully comply with two outstanding subpoenas issued in 2013 by another committee one subpoena dealt specifically with documents pertaining to the state departments accountability review board known as the arb the other subpoena dealt with documents that had previously undergone limited congressional review where members access to the documents and information was restricted to certain dates and times set by the state department these subpoenas were still legally binding on the state department when this committee was created yet the department had not fulfilled them in an effort to expedite the departments fulfillment of these subpoenas the select committee prioritized the departments production of documents under these two subpoenas as opposed to issuing new requests in addition by directing the department to identify documents under these existing subpoenas the committee was better positioned to receive new documents in a more expeditious manner while at the same time judiciously reviewing the work of past committees these negotiations resulted in the state department providing 15 000 pages of new documents to the committee in august and september of last year this production also fulfilled the departments obligation for one of the two subpoenas the review of these documents was enlightening both in what it disclosed and what it did not here is what it did disclose for the first time the department produced eight emails eight to or from former secretary clinton additionally the committee became aware that former secretary clinton had used a private email account to conduct official state department business importantly the committee did not release the existence of the private email account because of its commitment to investigate all the facts in a fair and impartial manner here is what it didnt disclose from the review of the 15 000 pages however the committee recognized that there were significant omissions in the documents notably there were very few emails between and among former secretary clintons senior staff and the secretary as a result last november the committee requested the state department produce specific documents and emails related to benghazi and libya for the secretary and 10 of her senior staff in the 2 months following the committees request committee staff consistently relayed to the department that its new top priority was all of secretary clintons emails almost 3 months later on february 13 2015 the department produced approximately 300 emails to and from the former secretary during her time as the head of the state department remember these are emails of which the state department never possessed and didnt have to look for yet it took that length of time they didnt produce a single document to the committee related to the remaining portions of the november request what was the state department doing during the time the former secretary was going through her emails after they produced these emails the state department asked what our priority was we continued to inform them that the 10 senior officials identified in the november request were our priority including cheryl mills jake sullivan huma abedin and susan rice the state department told committee staff that this request was too broad and that it was unable to search for these documents on march 4 2015 the committee issued a subpoena for the documents and emails first requested in november this subpoena sought documents and emails for the 10 senior state department officials including those named previously despite the committee indicating emails and documents from the subpoena were its top priority the department informed the committee that it would instead begin producing documents pursuant to the outstanding arb subpoena remember this subpoena was first issued in august of 2013 and reissued on january 28 2015 since it expired at the end of the previous congress i would also point out that the law requires that these recordsand this is the records from the arband it is very important that you understand this that the law says that these records shall be separated from all other records of the department of state and shall be maintained under appropriate safeguards to preserve the confidentiality and classification of information this means the records should have been sitting on a shelf somewhere easily identifiable unfortunately it took them 2 years to find where this arb report was supposed to be segregated and put up the committee continued to indicate that its priority was for the emails from the senior state department personnel that were first requested in november the departments response it could not search for these documents instead the department ignored the committees request and on april 15 2015 nearly 2 years after congress first issued a subpoena for the arbs documents the state department finally produced more than 1 700 pages of documents related to the arb again instead of responding to the committees request on april 23 2015 the department produced an additional 2 500 pages of documents related to the arb the department has said that with minor exceptions it has now fulfilled the requirements of that subpoena notwithstanding the arb production the committee continued to press the department its top priority is the documents from the original november 2014 request and the march subpoena the state department however has done little but talk about the breadth of the subpoena and the inability to adequately search for documents the department continues to state that it does not have the technical capabilities to do such a wide search without specific search terms yet the department never used any search terms to conduct in its search nor has the department ever suggested any search terms to the committee to help the committee better understand the departments technical capabilitiesor lack thereofthe committee has taken several different steps we asked the state department to bring its technology expert and its records officer to a meeting to discuss how records were kept retrieved and produced specifically we requested a meeting with the relevant people from within the state department who can explain in detail how the state department maintains its records and how it has researched for documents pursuant to this committees november request and further detail the limitations of the departments ability to fully respond to the chairmans document request these people would likely include individuals from legislative affairs office of the legal adviser bureau of information resource management and possibly the records officer and any other individual who will be able to answer detailed questions on the topic this meeting will help us further sequence and prioritize the information and issues in the committees request as you suggested we do in your letter of february 13 to chairman gowdy that the state department sent us we also included a list of 13 questions to the department to help guide the discussion samples of these questions include the size of the universe of potentially relevant hard copy and or electronic field for each person from the data range period keyword or phrase searches the department plans to use for production and any limitations imposed on the type of data to be searched these are some pretty straightforward questions when the state department appeared for the meeting they did not only bring those subject matter experts with them the staff they did bring could not answer these basic questions in fact it was during this meeting for the first time that the committee learned that the state department was not in possession of the former secretarys emails however there was no mention of her use of a private server the committee again asked the department to meet with these individuals again the department did not provide them at an april 10 meeting between committee staff and the department the state department brought in an individual yet when pressed by committee staff on these specific questions the department refused to provide the specific answers last week we continued the pressure we told the department that members of the committee including myself would travel to the state department to view firsthand how they search for documents and have a discussion about the shortcomings they claim to have but what did the department do when we told them that we were coming they scrambled and did everything possible to deter our visit earlier this week however we did learn more about the departments internal process for identifying and reviewing documents but we didnt get this information from the department instead we had to learn it from a lawsuit this past week on may 18 the state departments acting director for its information programs and services filed a sworn declaration in a foia lawsuit the freedom of information lawsuit that declaration outlined the steps the state department had taken since it received approximately 55 000 pages of emails from former secretary clinton in december of 2014 to review those documents for public release under the freedom of information rules also in that sworn statement the state department asserted that it had dedicated on a fulltime basis a project manager two case analysts and nine freedom of information reviewers to review all 55 000 pages of emails since april these 12 individuals are precisely the 12 fte positions that were recently funded by the state departments 2 5 million reprogramming request let me say that again the state department repeatedly complained to the committee that a lack of staff and other resources prevented it from making more timely production of documents to the committee so the committee supported a reallocation of funds to enable the state department to hire additional staff to work on document production to provide to this committee however we continued to press the state department for answers last month we went so far as to put in writing 27 specific questions that the state department needed to answer regarding its ability to produce documents to the committee and the use of the private email account by secretary clinton these were simple questions that fell into three simple categories these categories are the state departments initial approval if any of secretary clintons email server arrangement the state departments knowledge about this email server arrangement its attempt to retrieve her email and the lack of candor by the department towards the committee about this despite the committees persistent requests for these emails and number 3 details of the departments review of her emails to ensure the department is properly marshaling resources to respond to our requests yet here we are more than 1 month later and the department hasnt even been able to answer a single one of the 27 questions in writing in addition we have attempted on multiple occasions to direct the department toward specific key documents that we are after we have prioritized our subpoena from 10 names down to 4 names and then again down to 3 names we have prioritized dates of documents from 2 years down to 1 year down to 3 months but again here we are 21 2 months after we issued a subpoena and 6 months after we first sent the letter and the department has still not produced any of these priority documents first we moved a foot then we moved a yard and now we have moved our position one mile but the state department has not budged 1 inch i would just like to show a little chart that shows the noncompliance that the state department has done so far on 11 18 of 2014

everything we know to do to get these documents so we can finish this investigation i dont know that anybody has any more right to know what has gone on than the american people and especially those families of those four great americans that lost their lives the only thing holding us up from getting a definitive report of those actions before during and after those attacks is this executive branch and their department of state we are begging them and as we have said before we have moved an inch we have moved a foot we have moved a yard we have moved a mile and they have not moved one

eroded and i will continue to fight for the states rights and stop this continued federal power grab i look at justice roberts some of the dissension in his ruling and roberts forcibly criticized the majority sidestepping the democratic process and declaring that samesex couples have the right to marry when in his view such a right has no basis in the constitution the courts decision he complained orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human societies for millennia we are redefining that and then he goes on to the kalahari bushmen and to the han chinese the carthaginians and the aztecs just who roberts laments do we think we are the other three justices echoed roberts sentiment sometimes in even more strident terms justice scalia characterized the decision as a judicial putsch and suggested that before he signed on to an opinion like the majority i would hide my head in a bag this is from our supreme court justices i think it is a sad state of affairs that in the three branches of government that we are out of balance we as member of congress are the most powerful branch it is the way our founders set our country up it is the longest living democracy and constitutional free republic in the world the reason for that is the checks and balances i would like to say to you and to my colleagues that our three branches of government are seriously out of balance and at times during human history when the government oversteps its boundaries whether in total or in the different branches and they overstep the boundaries of the constitution it is not only our duty but it is our responsibility as americans and as the peoples house in the united states of congress to stand up and rein in government and hold those other branches accountable i look forward to working with my colleagues on the house floor to make sure that we are the ones that stand up and say enough is enough we have had enough"], [0.58205646276474,

used them as a political bargaining chip to try to force congress to comply with his domestic agenda the bottom line for me is our troops deserve better than that that is the reason i support this bipartisan budget act of 2014 it stops the cuts in defense it increases the money going to our troops it prevents them from being used as a bargaining chip in the future because it sets the military budget for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 so that that is decided they cant be used as leverage for some other agenda i think that is the sort of stability and predictability they need and that

congressional budget within 5 billion now that is not enough money to repair all the damage that has been done over the past 5 years but it is in the ball park if we do not approve this budget then

louisiana my neighborwonderful points being made i also want to call attention today to the 43rd anniversary of the release from imprisonment of american pows from north vietnam among whom is our friend and hero here in the house sam johnson it was nice of staff to have a little reception for congressman johnson and it is important to remember such things and try to learn from our mistakes because once again in the last couple of weeks i have heard references to mistakes of the past like the lesson we should have learned from vietnam and then they get the lesson all wrong we really didnt allow our military in vietnam to win the war in vietnam our pilots our military operations they could have won that war had they been allowed to do so and the best indication of that is after 7 years that sam johnson spent in just the most horrid conditions horrendous torture joined by other american heroes like john mccain who was 3 years at the hanoi hilton where sam johnson was i know he was shot down 5 years before the release but it was only the last 3 years that he was placed in confinement there with i believe 10 others in the worst of the worst facilities so bad that even today after they cleaned up some of the torture chambers and tried to dress them up they still wont let americans go into the original hanoi hilton where they held 11 including sam johnson in the most horrid of conditions but the chronology basically in a nutshell nixon promised that he would if he was reelected he would get us out of vietnam so after reelection they start the paris peace talksand i realize this is a gross generalization they start the paris peace talks the north vietnamese storm out so nixon orders carpet bombing of sites in north vietnam that they had never been allowed to bomb before including the areas in hanoi itself sam has related personally that when they first heard the first bomb drop they thought wow one might fall here and then they were absolutely overjoyed that finally their country the united states of america was finally bringing the war to the north vietnamese leaders they had not done that so there was massive bombing for 2 weeks after 2 weeks tremendous bombing then the leaders came rushing back to the peace tables lets work this out they got a peace accord agreed to they agreed to provide all the names locations of americans who were killed in action or missing in action provide all of the pows apparently american officials knew pretty quickly they didnt give us everybody and that is another dark chapter in our history but they agreed to release the pows as sam johnson and others were being released from the hanoi hilton he said probably the cruelest of the officers there was laughing and smirking at the americans as they were allowed to leave and go to a bus and basically said you stupid americans if you had just bombed us for one more week we would have had to surrender unconditionally yes that is right the lesson of vietnam should have been that we should never ever put our military in harms way without giving them all of the equipment and ordnance they need to win and the order to win if we are not willing to give them rules of engagement that allow them to win they should not be sent yet since this administration has been in office there have been three to four times more american military lives lost i am told by many in the military because of the rules of engagement because of where they are placed without being able to properly defend themselves that under commander in chief obama three to four times more military members american military members have given their lives their last full measure of devotion than were lost during the 71 4 years in which the war in afghanistan raged at its highest under commander in chief bush the difference is you had one commander in chief that gave them more authority to win and a second a later commander in chief that tied their hands behind their backs so that brings us to where we are today 43 years after sam johnson and other american pows were released from north vietnam the real lesson of vietnam still hasnt been learned because we have still got american military members being killed abroad in afghanistan without giving them the rules of engagement to protect themselves and if that were the end of the story that would be bad enough but it is even worse when our military members have been subjected to the examples of having american military members punished sent to prison if they dared to put the safety and lives of their men as the first consideration of their actions and their orders so we have a lieutenant in leavenworth who when an afghan on a motorcycle refused to honor the signs the orders to stop refused to stop or even slow down when shots were fired in his direction and so you have to give some credit to this administration and the military leaders and the orders that make their way from the top down and the rules of engagement as to why just in recent weeks we have lost military members when someone on a motorcycle rode up and exploded themselves they knew our american military that died in that suicide motorcycle bombing they knew what had happened to the lieutenant all of our people in afghanistan know what happened when this administration makes an example out of an officer who dares to put the safety of his own people uttermost in his mind it is a sad time in america our allies notice that if we will not even take the life the treasure of our own american military more seriously then how can they possibly put their faith in us that we will keep our word and protect them they have seen what happened in ukraine 1330 they didnt really lift a finger to help the ukrainians against the russian aggression in fact after russian aggression against georgia president bush put some sanctions in place relations got more chilled between the united states and russia because of the egregious unfair actions of russia in georgia the first thing this president did was send hillary clinton over with a plastic red button they put the wrong interpretation on it they meant to say a reset button and they got the wrong language on there the message was very clear to the russians ah president obama and hillary clinton dont care if we violate their allies they dont care if we invade their friends they dont care they want a reset button and basically have apologized for getting upset that we in russia invaded georgia so hillary clinton and president obama are fine with us invading other places what were they supposed to think that this administration would do when they invaded ukraine well they guessed right that this administration wouldnt really do anything about it oh i am sorry i forgot this administration did do something about the russian aggression in fact the president delivered it he didnt know the microphone was picking him up when he said basically tell vladimir that i will have a whole lot more flexibility after the election so they got the messages we can pretty much abuse and invade whatever we care to do it is outrageous what has happened to american reputation abroad so today is the 43rd anniversary we salute sam johnson and all those pows that were released today from north vietnam i wish we had learned the lesson from the horrors that they experienced in fact there is an article here by anne bayefsky it originally appeared on fox news this was released february 11 2016 by human rights voices there is a dangerous scam gaining traction at the united nations backstopped by the white house that is our unitedstates presidents house its called violent extremism given the u n s long and undistinguished history of being unable to define terrorism and an american president who chokes on the words radical islamic terrorism pledges to combat violent extremism have become all the rage it turns out that the terminological fast one is a lethal diplomatic dance that needs to be deconstructed and quickly in 1999 the organization of islamic cooperation that is the oic enemy insert parenthetically mr speakerthe oic organization of islamic cooperation has all of the islamic nations except the united states included in it and they also include the palestinians that are in the nation of israel i always get confused whether the oic has 50 states and we have in the united states 57 states or whether the oic has 57 states and we have 50 so i shared that with our president when he was running for the presidency as he got confused whether the unitedstates has 57 statesno that is the oicand the united states has 50 it is confusing the article states in 1999 the organization of islamic cooperation adopted an antiterrorism treaty stating that armed struggle against foreign occupation aggression colonialism and hegemony aimed at liberation and selfdetermination shall not be considered a terrorist crime in practice that means it is open season on all israelis as well as americans and europeans who get in the way each of the 56 islamic states actually the oic is 57 because they claim palestine and what the un labels the state of palestine is a party to this treaty the september 11 terror attacks then launched a growth industry in u n counterterrorism chitchat and paraphernalia yearafteryear islamic states have prevented the adoption of a un comprehension convention against terrorism by refusing to abandon their claim that certain targets are exempt in 2001 the u n security council created the counterterrorism committee but it is unable to name a state sponsor of terrorism in fact from 2002 to 2003 syria a state sponsor of terrorism was a member in 2005 the u n commission on human rights once chaired by colonel qaddafis libya created the u n expert on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorismas if countering terror is not about protecting human rights in 2006 the general assembly adopted a global counterterrorism strategy it manages to cast terrorists as victims pillar number one starts by worrying about conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism youth unemployment for instance purportedly results in the subsequent sense of victimization that propels extremism and the recruitment of terrorists in 2011 the u n established the counterterrorism centerat the initiative of saudi arabia the saudis threw 100 million at the venture and became chair of the advisory board saudi financing of radical charities and academic exercises around the world are somehow left out of center events on investigating and prosecuting terror financing integral to thebestdefenseisagoodoffence routine has been the constant unsubstantiated allegation of an islamophobia pandemic for the first decade of the 21st century the islamophobia charge was hurled in un resolutions on the defamation of islam or the defamation of religion defamation meant the freedoms of human beings should be trumped by the rights of religion in 2009 defamation was repackaged by the general assembly as human rights and cultural diversity ever since the over 100 countries of the nonaligned movement vote against western states and demand the freedoms of human beings be trumped by cultural diversity and thats cultural diversity iranstyle in december 2015 the un resolution praised tehrans centre for human rights and cultural diversitythe brainchild of former iranian president and wellknown human rights aficionado mahmoud ahmadinejad in the last six weeks alone islamic states have staged two un meetings focusing on islamophobia and inclusive societies and countering xenophobia two weeks ago the servile secretarygeneral ban kimoon couldnt mention antisemitism on the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz without connecting it to antimuslim bigotry of course the islamophobia drumbeat skips right over the xenophobia antisemitism and exclusively that is endemicand officiallysanctionedin islamic states this is the substrate from which ban kimoon has now manufactured a plan of action to prevent violent extremism introduced in january the general assembly is meeting on february 12 2016 to push the plan forward after one mention of isil alqaeda and boko haram the plan insists that violent extremism does not arise in a vacuum narratives of grievance actual or perceived injustice become attractive it is critical that in responding to this threat stresses the plan that states be stopped from overreacting topping conditions conducive to violent extremism is lack of socioeconomic opportunities this just shows the ignorance in the u n in propagating such a plan and the sheer naivety if not outright intentional misleading of those who would read their report lack of socioeconomic opportunities is not what caused one of the wealthier islamists to put together and carry out a plan of attacking the world trade center the pentagon and apparently this capitol he was wealthy so are many of those who are funding terrorism it arises out of radical islamic beliefs nobody should have to ever say we know all muslims dont believe this it should go without saying we know that but for those that do it is sheer idiocy to claim that islam has nothing to do with the radical islamic terrorism that is occurring when you have one of the most worldrenowned experts on islam who has studied his whole life on the koran the holy koran as he would call it the tenets and the pillars of islam and even has his ph d we are told in islamic studies from the university of baghdadi think i forgot to mention he is the head of isis the head of the islamic state is one of the worlds foremost experts on islam and he says the islamic state is exactly what islam is all about i know when i was a judge people had to put on evidence as to educational background and study in an area so that i as the judge could determine whether that man or woman was actually an expert in their field i would say the head of isis with his educational background and his research and study certainly is far more of an expert on islam than our president or valerie jarrett or anybody in this administration the article says here we go again the bigots fanatics and killers are allegedly driven by our annoying insistence on fighting backwhich the plan astonishingly calls the cycle of insecurity and armed conflict as per usual in u n negotiations the obama administration has jumped on board while islamic states are holding out for greater elaboration of their grievances and even more nothing to do with religion or islam clauses the u n s idea of a winwin is an illusory global partnership to confront this menace that allows states to define violent extremism any which way they want this plan of action pursues a practical approach to preventing violent extremism without venturing to address questions of definition only u n conartists could present refusing to identify a problem as the most practical way to solve it more practically speaking the latest palestinian terror wave began by pumping bullets into a young mom and dad in front of their little kids for the crime of being jews living and breathing on arabclaimed land in u n terminology eitam and naama henkin were extremist settlers so to all you extremist lovers of liberty beware the violent extremists in u n clothing and the morallychallenged commanders in chief bringing up the rear well written we have got to wake up we had another bombing we have more violence we hear from isis leaders that they have been able to get some of their best warriors into the united states and into europe posing as refugees we have the head of the fbi who warns all of us

hearing before an article iii federal district court in fact there is no district court mentioned in article iii the only court mentioned is the supreme court as my old constitutional law professor

support just 2 weeks ago the bill accomplishes the twin goals of protecting our nation from our enemies while safeguarding the civil liberties that our servicemembers fight for every day americans across the country have called for the nsa to listen less and elected officials to listen more the usa freedom act will end the nsas bulk collection program which was established under section 215 of the patriot act and it will further protect americans fourth amendment rights by strengthening oversight and accountability of the intelligence community as a member of the house armed services committee i work with our servicemembers and military leaders daily to ensure our adversaries do not harm this great nation that is why i applaud chairman goodlatte and mr sensen3renner for including provisions in the bill to address the growing threat of isil with continued threats of terrorism our nations intelligence community must be equipped to protect our nation and national security interests however any intelligence framework must be confined within the boundaries of the united states constitution striking this balance between safeguarding privacy and protecting americans is a challenge in todays post9 11 world but it is one that should not tip towards allowing the government to trample on our constitutional rights security must not come at the cost of americans liberties that is why i urge my colleagues today to support this bill"]]}
