deserve to be addressed first of all he makes the point as he did earlier that this is not something which should be in the purview of this particular bill at this particular time and that we ought to address it through the regulatory processes of the congress the problem is that the gentleman from illinois and the gentlewoman from kansas in pursuing this have attempted to do this and have always been rebuffed and always found that there was something else of higher priority for the congress to take up therefore the regular mechanisms have not worked for this bill which is in fact supported broadly in the house of representatives secondly it is suggested that somehow this is not a place where small business is really involved and it is a committee on science space and technology kind of a bill i would suggest that small business is the competitive sector of our society at this time i know that the gentleman from california does share that concern and has always been very very solicitous toward small business concerns i know that all of us try to work with our small businesses on this regulatory overload that the federal government has imposed upon that sector perhaps it is in a competitiveness bill where we o ught to begin to address the real concerns they have out there there is no doubt that this particular bill about competitiveness is one where if we have a chance to help small business a little bit we ought to go ahead and do so finally it has been suggested that this is a lawyers bill that what we are going to do here is going to end up giving lawyers morework i would simply say to that that the problem for small business right now is that we have created a whole web of federal regulation that is employing lawyers by the hundreds of thousands across the countrythat the agencies have the ability to constantly go after business with the lawyers that are hired by the government and that 9mall business in many instances is a victim all this will do is give the victim some recourse within the process i think that rather than victimizing small business without recourse that it is high time that in this country we give them the appropriate recourse that is provided to them by the courts i would like to think too that congressional oversight would take care of this problem but the fact is we have gone 14 years now with this bill on the books and congressional oversight has not taken care of the problem businesses find themselves more and more burdened by government regulation and more and more the heavy hand of government is causing

reconciliation plan and his economic plan for growth and reducing the deficit and also for her very magnificent presentation and very clear presentation of the new direction that this deficit reduction plan will take our country i thank her very much for giving me this opportunity to participate in her special order tonight i am very pleased that the presidents plan as amended by the house and senate conferees turns out to be a very profamily plan it does this by its investments that it makes in people that helps at the very same time to reduce the deficit to give our people work not welfare and to give them hope not despair how does it do this well it is profamily in many respects one is its childrens initiatives that are contained in this package childhood immunization the family preservation and support act the mickey leland hunger relief act and the earned income tax credit in addition to the enterprise zones which will help create jobs in some of the areas of our country which need them the most i would just like to take a few minutes to elaborate on some of these points and then move on to some of the economic arguments that spring from these i believe that while these are profamily and they are investments in people they will help get this country moving as well as reduce the deficit as far as the immunization initiative is concerned president clinton said on our nation is the only industrialized nation in the entire world that does not guarantee childhood vaccination for all children it ought to be like clean water and clear air it ought to be part of the fabric of our life so spoke our president and he said that in the context of only 55 percent of our nations 2yearolds fully immunized against vaccinepreventable diseases in 1991 because of these low immunization rates a measles epidemic swept across the country with 55 000 victims 166 people were killed in the epidemic and 11 000 americans were hospitalized this could have been prevented next in the package i want to commend our president and conferees for putting funds in for family preservation 1 billion child abuse and neglect is an escalating national crisis of devastating proportions nearly 3 million children were reported physically sexually or emotionally abused or neglected last year 3 million children in our country and at least 3 children a day die from abuse most before their first birthday that is hard to imagine while tie number of children reported abused in fact more than doubled between 1981 and 1991 federal funding has been cut in half i am very pleased that the president and conferees included as i mentioned 51 billion in this package next the mickey leland childhood hunger relief act is a very important domestic antihunger initiative the most important introduced in the last 16 years i am very pleased that the president has and well we would like more money always but i think at this moment it is 2 5 billion for the mickey leland hunger relief act it would allow families in addition to the funds it also will allow families to deduct high shelter costs in the same way that elderly and disabled households do so at present this is very very important for our families who exceed 50 percent of their income for shelter it would also encourage payment and collection of child support and assist working families and children then in that package i conclude my focus there on the earned income tax credit this proposal substantially raises the level of credit for working families with children to lift working families out of poverty and provide the modest credit to very poor workers without children to help ensure that the doors of opportunity are open for all you would expect i say to my colleague the gentlewoman from connecticut that i would be supportive of a program that contained these initiatives being on the progressive side of the spectrum in this body and i am pleased that they are in the package again i think they not only help people they help reduce the deficit but i do want to turn now to some business voices which favor the package let me say first that the american people according to the wall street journal last week they reported that americans are expressing more support for president clintons economic plan as it nears its crucial final vote by a comfortable margin of 54 to 32 percent people say that the clinton plan would represent a step in the right direction and the survey indicates that many americans are sour on the conduct of mr clintons republican critics the american people support this plan i now want to address some of the business leaders last week 58 business leaders many of them republicans from across the country endorsed president clintons economic plan i would like to call to the attention of my colleagues and our listeners the comments of some of those business leaders chairman august busch of anheuserbusch said we applaud the fundamental fairness of your initial plan as well as the diligence with which you have worked to keep equity a cornerstone of the final product jerry pearlman chairman of zenith electronics said i strongly support your 500 billion deficit reduction plan and the selective spending cute and appropriate investments i have no doubt that your plan will meet the major challenge of reducing the deficit while stimulating economic growth job creation and investment further to this xerox ceo paul allaire said successful passage of the budget reconciliation bill is a critical step in restoring longterm economic growth and job creation the presidents economic program is a balanced approach that shifts national policy away from deficit spending and toward jobcreating investment the chairman of time warner gerald levin said this legislation is our only opportunity to move forward on the economic front to fail at this moment would have grave consequences for americans and american business around the globe i am proud to join you in encouraging swift and positive congressional action the ceo of tenneco mike walsh said the united states cannot continue to live on borrowed time and borrowed money we elected a new president because we wanted change now it is time to act not blink or quit the president is taking on one of the most critical issues we face as a country and it is time for us to stand up support him and start attacking the deficit and then finally the president of h r block harry buckley said the majority of h r blocks clients are middle and lowerincome taxpayers many of whom would benefit from the presidents plan to expand and simplify the eitc and distribute the tax burden more fairly throughout all income brackets the new york times said in its editorial last month antitax rhetoric poses a threat to the common sense when the american congressional conferees meet this week to begin the arduous task of reconciling the house and senate budget bill we want common sense to prevail over political rhetoric we want this house to pass this budget very strongly you i say to my colleague presented very convincing arguments and compelling evidence of why this plan will work and why it must be done i think that it is clear that from left to right from people to business it is clearly viewed that we must reduce the deficit we must create jobs we must invest in people we must pass this package again i commend the gentlewoman for calling this special order and look forward to meeting here the next time we urge our colleagues to support the

large water project was completely redesigned and reformulated by congress in 1986 many expensive and environmentally destruction features of the project were eliminated much of the original irrigation was deauthorized in place or the irrigation the reformulated project would supply thousands of north dakota residents with high quality drinking water from the missouri river wetlands would be restored since the 1986 reformation congress has appropriated well over 100 million to construct the newly reformulated garrison project i have supported each and every one of those funding requests unfortunately however local sponsors of the project the garrison diversion conservancy district have repeatedly attempted to rewrite history and the law by repudiating the 1986 garrison reformatibn act their obvious intent is to resurrect the old garrison project complete with outdated expensive and wasteful irrigation late last year north dakota leaders and the garrison diversion conservancy district asked reclamation commissiondr beard to initiate yet another new process to determine north dakotaes contemporary water development needs the commissioner with the concurrence of all north dakota political leaders insisted that all north dakotans internally reach consensus on any propesed changes to the 1986 act when the governors proposal was issued just a few weeks ago it was promptly rejected by the north dakota congressional delegation eight years after we passed the reformulation act the delegation has advised the united states that our state is owed this project and that north dakota will not have to reimburse the federal government for major features of this project if the state of north dakota and its congressional delegation are not interested in constructing a major water resource project for the benefit of their citizens i see no reason why congress and the taxpayers should be expected to force the project upon them i intend to convene a hearing of the committee on natural resources to receive testimony on legislative proposals to further reform and perhaps even deauthorize the garrison project i would say that i have been given a letter that has been written to michael whittington the area manager of the bureau of reclamation by the delegation which has a statement by the congressional delegation that they plan to go back to start a new collaborative effort to produce concurrence among all of the interests in north dakota and to produce consensus legislation that they will introduce in congress to modify the garrison

may 12 to mr whittington that i am deeply disturbed by the suggestion that somehow this project is owed to north dakota and that they should not have to pay for what they should receive as compensation this project when it was passed in 1986 as a reformulated project was very narrowly passed by the congress by a handful of votes those handful of otes were secured by the effort of myself and many others to represent to the members of the congress that there would be consensus that there would be a fundamental reformulation and there would be repayment of this project that is what we did in 1986 after long negotiations on both the house and senate side to now suggest that somehow unilaterally one party or the other within north dakota is going to change the purposes and the intent of this act is simply unacceptable i hope that perhaps this letter is more reflective of the desire to enter into a true consensus rather than simply a onesided discussion within the state about

our states do have capital budgets all corporations use capital budgets most communities use capital budgets most other governmental bodies use capital budgets but what is the problem with it why should the federal government not use a capital budget the difference is one very fundamental reason and that is as it relates to all other governmental bodies we do not have a limitation that almost every other governmental body does have of keeping everything within an overall budget cap that is most states operate under a balanced budget requirement of their state let me explain why i think that is important since states do have a balanced budget amendment they cannot exceed the total spending by taking two items here social security and capital and placing them off budget under the

multibilliondollar nationwide renttoown industry under renttoown contracts consumers can acquire goods such as televisions vcrs and refrigerators through weekly or monthly payments but usually at exorbitant cost for the luxury of purchasing these goods over time a consumer often pays two or three times their cash price while the industry does serve the shortterm needs of such transient people as military personnel it also takes advantage of the lowincome consumer whose primary objective is to purchase the renttoown product through renttoown a poor woman pays 1 200 for a 400 television set that a rich man can buy on credit for 450 the industry has said it is providing opportunities to consumers who otherwise have no means to own these goods but at what price the opportunity on march 31 the committee on banking finance and urban affairs held a hearing in order to answer this question we heard from renttoown customers state attorneys general legal aid attorneys and consumer groups that the cost is much too high renttoown customers often pay the equivalent of 200 to 300 percent interest on common consumer goods the renttoown operators point to the services they provide their customers in defense of their stores high prices yet industry documents reveal that customer service is a major source of complaints the renttoown industry claims that the majority of its customers return goods rather than purchasing them however industry documents indicate that the majority of customers intend to purchase the goods at the time they enter into the contract the incredible weekly or monthly payments that renttoown customers must make may in the end prevent many of these customers from actual ownership most unfortunate is that renttoown is targeted at low income and minority consumers it is not rare to find renttoown stores in the same neighborhoods that check cashers and pawn shops inhabit it is the very individuals who can least afford to pay the premiums charged by these predatory industries who must often rely on them for goods and credit the all too common abusive practices of the renttoown industry have prompted the better business bureau to issue warnings to consumers about renttoown transactions despite the national and growing presence of the renttoown industry it remains unregulated by the federal government the industry has deliberately fashioned its transactions in such a way as to evade such consumer protection laws as the truth in lending act the consumer leasing act the fair debt collection practices act and the magnusonmoss act in the absence of controlling federal law renttoown operators have been battling in courtrooms and state legislatures around the country to ensure their status as lessors not retailers they have prevailed in a majority of states thus guaranteeing that renttoown arrangements are free from state usury ceilings yet attempting to have it both ways a renttoown company is now arguing in a kansas tax court that it is in the sales business in order to avoid paying state taxes on rental property drawing a distinction between the renttorent business and renttoown this dealer claims that when a customer contracts with a renttoown company both parties anticipate that the customer mayand probably willend up owning the merchandise in litigation consumers have also claimed that these arrangements are really sales contracts masquerading as leases to avoid limits on usurious interest some courts have agreed one thing is clear the industry cannot have it both ways renttoown operators cannot be lessors in order to evade state usury ceilings and federal disclosure laws and yet be sellers in order to escape state property taxes on september 22 1993 the wall street journal featured an article about rentacenter the largest operator of renttoown stores that front page article entitled peddling dreams a marketing giant uses its sales prowess to profit on poverty provides a remarkable detailed account of that companys outrageous collection and repossession practices high pressured sales pitches and outlandish marketing techniques aimed at welfare recipients among other accounts the article describes how a rentacenter employee repossessed the refrigerator of a diabetic customer and proceeded to throw her insulin on the floor the article describes how a rentacenter customer was intimidated into performing involuntary labor when he pawned a renttoown necklace the horror stories go on and on i am submitting this article for the record it is clear that congress must determine what measures are necessary to best arm consumers against these unscrupulous business practices after studying this industry i have concluded that the most effective way to protect consumers is to subject renttoown transactions to the same treatment as credit sales or retail installment sales under state and federal laws the bill that i am introducing today does just that thereby outlawing 300 percent interest rates and mandating disclosures of key contract terms nonetheless my bill recognizes the unique feature of renttoown contractsthe consumers ability to unilaterally terminate the contract this bill would permit a renttoown operator to charge a reasonable termination fee and in return provide the consumer with this unique right to terminate the contract without penalty this bill also recognizes that renttoown operators may provide services that some customers find attractive under the bill renttoown operators would be permitted to offer such services but they would be required to disclose those services up front and estimate their value by requiring such disclosure the consumer will be able to determine the true cost of renting the product in short my bill will provide renttoown consumers with the myriad safeguards extended to consumers of credit sales limits on interest and other fees mandated disclosures warranty protections and prohibitions against abusive collection practices the poor pay moreand in renttoown suffer at the hands of a sophisticated business whose practices all too often look more like racketeering than anything else the legislation i offer today would correct abuses such as those detailed in committee hearings investigative reports and numerous court challenges this business flourishes in the dark recesses between laws that protect more

building of humankind recognizing and acknowledging the reliance that we have individually and collectively upon divine providence we are pleased to note that representation came from all over the world5 continents 150 countries and all 50 states it included republicans and democrats ministers and laypersons parolees from prison students and teachers those of wealth as well as those with no material abundance and people from all major religions and all denominations i was reminded throughout the many months of the planning for the breakfast that invoking the word of god and belief and faith in the almighty are a common thread which runs throughout humankind on that morning as we prayed and sang together from all walks of life all religions and backgrounds i was struck by the peace serenity and joy that flowed through the room in philippians 4 67 the scripture reminds us be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds through jesus christ truly this scripture captured the moment as we gathered for this annual event of peace fellowship on behalf of the national prayer breakfast committee i request that the program and transcript from the breakfast be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks the members of the house and senate prayer groups are to be commended for not only their participation in this annual event but for their tireless dedication to our weekly meetings of fellowship and prayer for the record i include the program from the occasion and the transcript of the proceedings of the national prayer breakfast of 1993 the lord is my shepherd i shall not be in want he makes me lie down in green pastures he leads me beside quiet waters he restores my soul he guides me in the paths of righteousness for hisnames sake even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for you are with me your rod and your staff they comfort me you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil my cup overflows psalm 23 lord make me an instrument of your peace where there is hatred let me sow love where there is injury pardon where there is doubt faith where there is despair hope where there is darkness light and where there is sadness joy 0 divine master grant that i may not so much seek to be consoled as to console not so much to be understood as to understand not so much to be loved as to love for it is in giving

support of h r 2518 amid the many contentious issues contained within this legislation which we will debate today i think it is important to point out the important programs research and funding for which this legislation rovides indeed many of the programs funded under these departments are the daytoday lifeline programs so crucial to millions of americans foremost the lions share of funding contained in h r 2518 is designated spending for medicare and medicaid these are the dollars which support the federal share of the medicaid program and subsidize the medicare health services for our sick elderly while it is in fashion today to decry entitlement spending and slash medicare and medicaid spending for budget purposes we cannot lose sight of the essential purposes served by these programsfor beneficiaries this is often the only link they have to health care and medical services i do not mean to imply that these programs are unflawed nor that their growth need not be controlled but i stand firm in my commitment that health care policy and health care reform must be made on the issues of access and quality of health carenot a costbenefit exercise or balance sheet earlier this year i fiercely and vocally opposed the proposed cuts in medicare programs contained within reconciliation as i have long held we cannot try to tell our aging americans that all we have to do is ratchet down on waste fraud and abuse and cut the fees of those so called rich doctors and expensive hospitals and we will be able to cut costs and maintain quality health care that is just not so already the medicare program is losing its ability to attract and maintain the participation of quality providers furthermore it is painfully clear that shortfalls in medicare payments to hospitals and doctors will be costshifted and passed directly to every other insured american that means that over the next 2 years americans who have managed to hold on to health insurance will pick up 28 billion in medicare shortfalls to hospitals another 20 billion in underpayments to doctors and other providers will be costshifted to paying americans so as long as we as a nation do not turn the sick and injured away from our hospitalsso long as we are not leaving them to die in the streetsthe cost of caring for these patients will not go away only shifted to other insured patients this is exhibit a as to why we need to address the causes of our health care crisis not merely attach the symptoms todays legislatlon demonstrates our commitment to medicare and medicaid and funds more than 100 billion for these health care programs while we are not enacting changes in these statutes it is timely to once more remindmy colleagues that we cannot use these programs as sources for draconian budget cuts without question we need health care reform but not one which balances the budget on our most frail members of societythe sick elderly i am also pleased to see record levels of funding the national institutes of health including 2 1 billion for the national cancer institute these dollars will allow continued prevention research vaccine development treatment study and clinical experimentation toward eradicating this scourge the committee has reemphasized its support of ncis focus on breast cancer and prostate cancer research and rightly so more than 46 000 women die of breast cancer every year and one in eight women will suffer breast cancer in her lifetime this plague has hit especially hard in the northeast region of the united states and my own state of new jersey and i fully support efforts of nci to find the reasons and causesnd ultimately the curefor this terror at the same time more than 35 000 men will die of prostate cancer with more than 165 000 new cases diagnosed in 1993 i commend the recommendation of the committee that nci make prostate cancer another top priority in its research and mission the national institute of mental health also deserves recognition today i am confident nimh will make good use of the 613 million funded in fiscal year 1994 for its research and research training on mental disorders treatments and services and i laud the institutes efforts to educate federal local and state organizations as to the importance of mental health and the destigmatization of mental illness nimhs research continues to show us that mental illness is a real and physical one not some character flaw or personality demon that we cannot work to help or treat but a tangible physical health problem as real as diabetes cancer or a broken leg the work of nimh allows us so move past the dark ages of health care and move past the snake pit treatment of mental illness as congress addresses comprehensive health care reform i will be working to ensure that any reform plan provides equitable treatment for mental illness and party of health care insurance benefits and coverage for persons with mental illness nimhs pioneering research in this field has made clear what so many of us have known all along and sets the stage for future good work finally congress today is taking steps to make good on its promise in the ryan white care act to provide funding aids patients care intervention efforts and most notably emergency assistance to cities the committee has provided 318 million in emergency funding for especially hardhit cities and metropol tan areas and make no mistake my colipagues evry one of those dollars are especially needed the aids epidemic continues to grow and our public hospitals and health care resources are falling under this burden our emergency rooms in inner city hospitals are mash units today and the situation is worsening the lack of health services poverty and social dysfunction compounds this crisis as the cost of each aids patient reaches 100 000 over their lifetime the ryan white dollars cannot alleviate these problems or hope to pay every cost but our neglect can only further speed the collapse of our public health care system today aids is no longer a disease affecting the margins of societythe rate of increase of new cases shows us that every segment of society is touched by aids and every member of society bears those costs my colleagues these are but some of the worthy efforts contained in thi years appropriation i am certain that each line of this bill has its supporters and much more can be said as i indicated there are contentious and pressing issues to be debated but amid the highprofile questions lie the daytoday health and welfare needs of our american citizens they are the ones served by this bill and i urge my colleagues to support its passage"], [0.8413518071174622, 0.8413518071174622, 0, "the conference report provkes 201 724 000 for

specific examples of the negative effects this will have this proposition calls for 3 1 billion in administrative expense reductions it sounds harmless but when we take it down to the individual

legislation to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to provide that taxexempt interest shall not be taken into account in determining the portion of social security benefits subject to income taxation it is clear that in 1986 when this piece of legislation was passed that it was not intended to penalize those persons who contribute so much to the infrastructure of this nation by participation in buying municipal and other bonds presently those who are receiving social security benefits and earn taxexempt income and interest are unduly penalized by a stipulation in the internal revenue code of 1986 which causes their interest earnings to be treated differently i do not think that this is appropriate for persons who have given so much of their lives so much of their time that they come to a point in their life when they are treated differently than other citizens who participate in the purchase of bonds that help us to support our infrastructure and to support the work of our cities and our state in this nation in order to calculate the level of taxation of social security benefits the interest earned on taxexempt income such as municipal bonds is included in the formula used to determine if social security will be taxed thus social security recipients are not taxed as other tax payers in regard to interest from normally taxexempt securities this is

federal and postal workers and i think it is only fair to say that they have been diligent in their efforts to comply with the letter and the spirit of the hatch act we can expect the same response from them if this reform measure is enacted there has been a great deal of speculation that public employees unions are out to control the government however federal and postal workers are not sheep who may be led around by some imaginary big brother they are individuals they are patriotic and articulate citizens who are knowledgeable about many aspects of the united states government they

he became a district fed eral judge back in texas sam was a gentle easy going individual who possessed a keen intellect and worked hard for our nation and his constituents in his congressional district i got to know sam better when he and i were among several members of congress from the armed services and veterans committees who visited beirut lebanon shortly after the tragic bombing that killed some 250 of our marines like the rest of us sam wanted to know more about this incident and wanted to make sure the injured and the families of those who perished were receiving necessary care and were fullyinformed one of sam halls best friends is a friend of mine pat groner in pensacola fl pat and sam grew up together in marshall tx they attended the same schools and maintained that strong bond of friendship until sam passed awayon april 10 1994 pat says in their youth that he and sam were fellow members of an organization in which good scholarship and no smoking nor drinking was permitted an indication of the strong christian character of both men pat groner was named for pat m neff and the fathers of both pat and sam hall played a role in helping pat neff to become governor of texas governor neff later served as president of baylor university while sam and pat were students there sam hall was very active in civic work and was known and loved by hundreds of people who

in this measure none whatsoever all the existing land use controls are kept none are expanded none are changed this bill provides us with extraordinary educational opportunities this country is now more than 200 years old at an earlier time we recognized the importance of preserving places like yellowstone and yosemite people today pay tribute to those people the leaders of the country at that time who had the foresight to do so this is precisely what is being done here today and in the 200 years of this country much has been done here that needs to be protected and enhanced and talked about these american heritage areas are in fact educational laboratories for this and future generations the blackstone river valley for example in massachusetts and rhode island talks about the development of commerce in this country and industry in this country and the first way it came here it is very important to preserve that the american coal heritage area in west virginia also talks about the way we developed energy in this country all of these areas across the country need to be preserved need to be enhanced this bill will do it it does it in a comprehensive way that protects existing controls puts no additional controls on any land and simply allows for us to celebrate this as history ina reasonable way"], [0.03737896680831909, 0.5373789668083191, 0, "madam chairman i will not repeat those points made by my predecessors however i do with to publicly thank once again chairman lipinski for his persistence and hard work it has been perhaps the most bipar tisan effort i can remember and that is saying something given the length complexity and controversy surrounding this particular piece of legislation this is really a culmination of some 6 years of hard work by this committee i would be remiss if i did not also express my appreciation to the gentleman from massachusetts and our ranking republican the gentleman from texas for their leadership on this most important piece of legislation compromise has been a key ingredient and as a result i really believe that we have developed a proposal which both maritime labor the operators and yes the shipyards can in fact endorse for me enactment of a series transition program is critically important and i am indeed pleased that it is part of this package certainly there are those who believe that all unitedstates flag vessels should be built in unitedstates shipyards i am one of those members but i also recognize that holding the opera tor segment hostage is not the answer madam chairman the subcommittee adds provisions which i believe offer a viable yet reasoable opportunity to build odselifible vessels in u shipyards simply statedi if our series traasition program is funded then ous shipyards can and will be competitive players in the world shipbuildtng market the provisions in el 2401 the fiscal year 1994 dod authorization bill will alga help but to prevent a sealand or an apl or a lykes from ever haming an opportunity to fly the unitedstates flag with unitedstates crews serves no enss interests the series transition payment program is terribly important to those members who have shipyards in their districts with minimal commercial construction in unitedstates shipyards and the decrease in unitedstates tavy contracts it has been estimated if we in the congress do nothing that over 18u 000 skilled jobs will be lost in unitedstates shipbuilding ship repair and marine equipment manufacturing industries within the next 6 years let me take a few minutes to explain the elements of the series transition payment program in simple terms this programn authorizes the secretary of transportation to pay for the difference in cost between building a vesse which is one of a series in a unitedstates shipyard and building that same vessel in a foreign shipyard a similar construction program in the 197080 timeframe resulted in a tremendous number of ships being built in unitedstates shipyards with the defense buildup in the earlier 1980s our shipyards were essentially converted to naval shipyards these naval ships were often one of a kind and highly sophisticated both in terms of design and weaponry while our shipyards were committed to a naval building program our for sign competitors were building commercial vessels these commercial vessels were not one of a kind but instead were of similar design and specifications this is a critical difference because in shipbuilding as in any heavy industrial production process eficlencles are obtaineid by producing the saine item over and over again not only will the labor force become more efficleat bui the infrastructure that is assembly lne robotics et cetera will remain the same the need for thecostly retein of your assembly line is virtually eiminated and in fact is amortized over a greater number of vessels our foreign competitors have in effect been building commercial vessels in series for the last 10 years typical the learning curve cost savings over the frst four to five ships in a series before it flattens out is in the 2025 percent raage the savings in manhoum between the first hip in a series and later ships is well domnented a wellknown naval architect dr loyd bergeson analyzed manhour data compiled from 15 shipyards that were dedicated to the construction of liberty ships in world war i the average manhours per shig for all 15 shipyards for the first ship in the series was 1 120 000 the fourth ship in the series averaged 725 0w manhours and the eighth ship averaged 580 00 manhours n another study comparing united states and japanese shipyards the amthor dr howard bunch concluded that the japanese comparative performance advantage whe traceable to the fact the japanese yards have developed concepts of standardlzatten and modularlsaton that permit a law portion of the deeg and engineering activities to be essentially the retrieval of the documentation from fies standardization of designs and overcoming the learning curve are the twin goals of the stp program let me comment on two other points concerning the current stp proposal first a drafted priority for award of contracts is given to those shipyards that can reach the world market price with the fewest number of vessels in the series and with the smallest contribution from the federal government thus unlike the old constructionillfferential subsidy program the stp program establishes mitre unitedstates shipyard competition second a unitedstates shipyard that seeks a transition payment must have two contracts in hand before applying for aid and must demonstrate that upon completion of the vessels in the series that it will be capable of constructing additional vessels of the same type at the world market price and without assistance now with respect to labor rates our shipyards are in fact competitive now for instance the average per hour wage level in germany is 26 50 in italy the average hourly wage in 1990 was 19 22 in japan the wage level was 15 80 per hour in the united states the wage level was 15 50 per hour wages are no more a problem than they are for bmw or mercedes who are relocating their plants to south carolina and alabama respectively if we can in fact overcome the learning curve through the stp program then i am personally convinced we can once again become a major shipbuilding power finally i do not want to mislead anyone here today the stp program will not without more congressional action suddenly end our foreign competitors n0year monopoly of commercial shipbuilding you should also note that our commttee has not requested a specific funding level for the series transaction program this is a conscious decision on our part first because negotiations are currently taking place in eurole between the united states and the european community concerning shipbuilding we did not want t tie the hands of the president in those negotiations in simple terms the appropriation level requested in the presidents budget for fiscal yar 1995 will ber dependent on the outcome of these negotiatiomsa if the negotiations are auecessful then we will need to fund a smaller sum of money to overcome the learning curve phenomenon if however our competitors continue their sub rose subsidies then we will need to look at a higher number the actual funding levels for the stp program will not come util fiscal year 1995 and of course will be subject to additional debate and additional vetes many of you hear in statement after statement that we have effected a delcate balance and that we cannot change this section or that sectionor the whole bill will become unraveled with respect to the current unitedstates shipbuilding requirements in h 2151 1 sincerely believe we have a true compromise that deserves a chance to work i know the vast majority of our unitedstates shipyards are willing to make these provisions work i think most of the operators can work within this framework i just hope that my elleagues and the administration will give it a chance"], [0.04898488521575928, 0.5489848852157593, 1, "i think everyone needs to realize
