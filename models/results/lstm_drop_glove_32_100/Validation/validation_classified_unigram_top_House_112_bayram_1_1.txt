unbalanced because it asks very little of the folks at the very top and reduces dramatically our investments in our kids education and it does end the medicare guarantee seniors will no longer be able to stay in the medicare program they will be forced into the insurance program it immediately does end the prescription drug benefit something we worked hard to close the doughnut hole it ends the effort that was put in place under the affordable care act to end the doughnut hole so i would say to the gentleman from georgia who spoke earlier those seniors who are calling his office they will lose that benefit in closing the doughnut hole right away if this republican budget passes for other seniors and people who have been paying in the medicare system through their payroll taxes we want to make sure they have the benefit of the medicare guarantee throwing them into the private insurance market and giving them a deal that members of congress do not give ourselves is wrong it is absolutely wrong we have a fair share deal and we are asking seniors to take a raw deal we have a true premium support system for members of congress where the federal government shares the risk of

economy and our shared quest to create good american jobs being globally engaged takes many forms it includes exporting our goods overseas it includes imports it includes complex supply chains that allow us to maximize comparative advantage and productivity on a global scale it demands innovation creativity and adaptability this is all part of the dynamic worldwide marketplace and it does not constitute a zero sum game if a unitedstates manufacturer can lower costs by importing some of their raw materials increasing their competitiveness and hiring more unitedstates workers as a result our job market improves american workers benefit by the same token if a company can tap into other labor markets becoming more competitive in the process and then hiring more unitedstates workers as a result we can all benefit this is not a hypothetical scenario we have the data that demonstrates the clear benefits of engaging in the worldwide marketplace the last time the issue of outsourcing became a political flash point was in 2004 we often heard this term benedict arnold ceos who were sending good unitedstates jobs overseas the mckinsey global institute did an indepth analysis of the effect of outsourcing to see what impact it was actually having on our economy what they found was very interesting they found that companies that utilize outsourcing as a component of their business plans enjoy new export opportunities increased productivity and significant cost savings all of which support new investment in the united states and greater job creation right here at home

report are only buttressed by my own firsthand experience ill never forget several years ago i was in kathmandu visiting one of those call centers now many would have viewed that call center as a symbol of outsourced jobs and yet when i looked around i found unitedstates companies right there im not claiming that all of these products were manufactured right here in the united states but many were manufactured here in this hemisphere they had names on them like carrier air conditioners there was a westinghouse refrigerator there dell computers and at t telephones rather than stealing jobs

that was made earlier i think did a disservice to those of us who were not supportive of the kosova operation there was no plan to war protect the kosovar albanians we used air power milosevic invaded with ground trops if members will remember that countrys population was literally literally pushed out into macedonia and elsewhereabout 1 6 million refugeesbecause there was no plan when milosevic sent in the ground troops and killed thousands of people because we had no plan to protect them an estimated 10 000 people were killed so the revisionism that somehow republican opposition to the war was a political calculation falls very very far from the truth and its a cheap shot i actually chaired hearings during the war and stated my oppositions based on principle as did other members so i expectand hopeunfounded revisionism would be avoided and that there would not be that lookback that does a disservice on the issue at hand to principled republican opposition so who exactly are we backing in libya what justification under international law is there for directing both unitedstates and foreign government assets to a rebel entity that is not democratically elected and therefore not necessarily representative of the people of that country we dont know in addition a senior nato official told cnn on june 9 that qadhafi was a legitimate target of the bombing campaign even though this was expressed as a nato position are we now to understand that the obama administration is sanctioning the killing of foreign leaders again pursuant to what international criteria or legal

croix river as we all know and as our office has been told this is one of the longest if not the longest unfinished bridge projects in the history of the united states thats why its come to this point where we actually have to go to congress to get permission from the federal government so that the state of minnesota and the state of wisconsin can build this commonsense bridge at their own expense and thats the point that were at not only will representative mccollum be acting against the wishes of 86 percent of the people that live and reside in the st croix river valley the responsibility for the increased costs of building this bridge rests squarely on the shoulders of representative mccollum and on her compatriots who have fought for decades to kill the building of this bridge the cost the bridge would have cost 80 million to complete back in 1992 if her compatriots wouldnt have tied this bridge project up for decades in the federal courts in nuisance lawsuits and why because they said there was pollution that was involved and what was this pollution that they asserted they said it would be visual pollution visual pollution because a federal bureaucrat came out to this river and pointed to the river and said that they didnt think that a bridge would look good built on this river and thats in spite of the fact that theres already a bridge thats here on this river this is a wide part of the river this is the river that is literally the birthplace of minnesota as long as people have been in the state of minnesota stillwater is the birthplace ive been working on this issue as a young mother living in this community as an activist citizen who saw what a commonsense project this is representative mccollum has talked about this being a megabridge this is a fourlane bridge and after all why wouldnt you build a fourlane bridge when you have a fourlane highway on minnesota connected to a fourlane highway in wisconsin representative mccollum is suggesting that we should be building a two or a threelane bridge why would you build a bridge that would be obsolete the day that its opened you would build a commonsense fourlane bridge to connect two fourlane highways this is also a center for industry in this region we have not only the prison the state prison we have also one of the largest window manufacturers in the world we have the sewer treatment plant the water treatment plant and we have a marina this is the place that has been the site thats been selected as the perfect place to build this bridge to connect these two communities as weve heard before this is an area that has a bridge that currently has a safety rating thats far below the safety rating of the bridge that collapsed in minneapolis in 2007 we have a historic opportunity a once inalifetime magic moment when we have governors that are republican and democrat senators that are republican and democrat representatives that are republican and democrat saying for once lets come together and do what the people expect and why did we get to this point bureaucratic red tape we are here in foursquare agreement with the administration saying lets get this done on behalf of the people of these two states lets do what should have been done decades ago and lets build this commonsense bridge stillwater minnesota is the site of minnesotas birthplace and now its the site of what we are told is the longestrunning unfinished bridge project in the nation in the 1950s discussions began for a replacement to the current 1931 lift bridge connecting minnesota and wisconsin over the st croix river in 1992 we saw progress that year a coalition of residents businesses transportation officials and environmental experts settled on a bridge design to replace the existing lift bridge they proposed a fourlane bridge to connect fourlane highways in both states to be built south of stillwater we are here today for congressional approval for this project to proceed without congressional approval the project will continue to face the government redtape and lawsuits that its seen over the past 20 years the st croix river crossing project before us is a bipartisan project with strong bipartisan

flown sorties over libyan airspace it has been reported that we have even targeted qadhafi himself we are at war the constitution vests congress with the exclusive power to declare war the president has not attempted to obtain congresss authorization for the war and yet at this moment as we debate on the house floor the war continues instead of following the constitution and seeking authorization the president made strained arguments to justify the continued operation at first the operation was supposed to be limited as though that undefined term serves as a constitutional escape clause my constituents certainly would be surprised if congress established a limited religion or subjected them to limited cruel and unusual punishment or quartered soldiers in their houses but only for a limited time after that limited argument ran its course the president turned to a u n security council resolution and an invitation from an organization of arab states to justify our involvement those organizations were not around at the time the constitution was written much less are they listed in its text the administration now has retreated from its constitutional arguments in public and claims that at least the war powers resolution does not forbid the strikes because were not involved in quote hostilities against libya imagine that the shoe were on the other foot that libya was bombing us would we view the libyan air forces bombing of our infrastructure as a hostile act of course we would last week a member of the other chamber called the presidents arguments quote cute i would use a different term embarrassing its embarrassing that the administration attempts to hide behind these transparently strained and flimsy arguments especially when were dealing with such a grave issue but do you know what would be more embarrassing if this congress did nothing more embarrassing than the presidents contortions of the law and disregard for the constitution would be if congress with full knowledge that it was occurring gave him a pass in the face of an attack on the constitution in the face of an attack on this institution and our powers as a coequal branch we must stand up and say stop if we dont we should be the ones who are embarrassed the amashkucinich amendment prohibits funds from being used for military force against libya to be clear i believe that congress doesnt need to do anything to stop the president from ordering force against libya because the president has not received authorization the use of force is already illegal however to reinforce our constitutional position our amendment says that beginning at the start of the fiscal year on october 1 the armed forces may not drop bombs on libya or otherwise use military force unlike the bill we considered the week before last our amendment does not implicitly authorize any actions against libya it simply says force may not be used because the president has not sought nor has he received authorization for
