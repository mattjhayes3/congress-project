offers a political document just before the fall elections my question to my friends across the aisle is very simple what are you afraid of why are you not allowing any other amendment to be offered during this 10hour debate why are you not allowing our side to have an alternative resolution so we can get into the very troubling aspects of this administrations conduct of war in iraq and our strategy on global terrorism many of us have grave concerns about how this administration has based its decisions in iraq these concerns are shared by many americans and our constituents throughout

their duties with honor and i want them to know that we have the highest regard and respect for them e 1130 the men and women of our armed forces have entered into a sacred covenant with this nation they have pledged to place their lives on the line for us and in return we have promised to give them the tools they need to fulfill their promise and the respect worthy of someone willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for this country the underlying legislation for this rule represents the dmbodiment of our commitment to the troops and while i know the overall bill enjoys bipartisan support including mine i must point out that this morning i believe the leadership of this body has betrayed that covenant it seems that just 1 week after passing a socalled reform bill with no teeth the majority is back to their same old tricks arrogantly preventing debate and consideration of critical measures that improve the bill and the lives of the people serving this nation they even prevented the distinguished ranking member of the armed services committee mr skelton from offering an amendment to his own defense bill the skelton amendment would have prevented the copays for medication for our military and their families from going up which they will if this bill is passed without the skelton amendment but the republican leadership refused to make it in order for those americans who are not familiar with the rules committee and i expect that is most of them and how it works what that effectively means is that a select few in the republican leadership have decided what the entire congress and the entire nation and what the men and women in uniform will get they decided that on their own without even a vote on the house floor without the debate and consideration of this full body given the rhetoric we hear on this floor every day about the troops and how important they are i feel compelled to ask my friends in the majority to justify how in less than 24 hours after they approved 70 billion in tax cuts for the wealths how they could refuse to allow us to even consider a measure to improve th6 health bare of our troops and their families we owe our troops more respect than this it is for similar reasons that many of my democratic colleagues and i are concerned with section 590 of this bill the section removes a longstanding requirement in our military code that requires chaplains to exhibit a level of tolerance compassion and understanding towards the religious diversity of the soldiers to whom they administer counsel can you imagine that mr speaker we are taking away the idea that they should serve with tolerance compassion and understanding it was too inflammatory i should say that i am confident our chaplains have both the sense and the respect for their fellow soldiers to do this and to do it willingly but why would this majority lower that standard and expect anything less from our chaplains as they clearly do we have soldiers of every faith and no faith fighting for us under the american flag they all deserve our respect particularly in moments of great despair or need is this majority so arrogant as to suggest that they should micromanage how a chaplain administers faith qn a battlefield i can think of few things more offensive or absurd my friend mr israel offered an amendment to the bill that would have corrected the problem restoring the requirement that all chaplains demonstrate sensitivity respect and tolerance but mr israels amendment was tossed out the window along with common sense on this issue it has been forbidden by the leadership from even being considered on the floor today as was an amendment from representatives tierney and leach which buyer cardoza davis il delay evans would have established a trumhnlike commission which we have been trying for 2 years to do one designed to ferret out corruption and incompetence in our military contracting and for some reason the majority of this house does not want to look where all that money is missing in iraq despite the fact that the same measure has passed the house numerous times and despite the fact that it is the clear will of this body that this commission be created and despite the fact that the word incompetence has become the most apt description of this administration a select few in this leadership made these decisions for all of us that we would not even consider that amendment today an amendment which were it enacted would allow us to go looking for the 9 billion in taxpayer money that this administration has literally lost in the war in iraq there are many more amendments to this bill that the leadership refused to allow us to consider today and because they are making decisions for all of us and for the american people

values so horribly and to do so without our consent is unconscionable the question my fellow americans should be asking themselves is why why will the republican leadership not allow the free flow of ideas that are supposed to be the hallmark of our government i think we are all beginning to see how the rigidity of their agenda the narrow focus of their concern and their obsession with control are not only damaging their own political future but are deeply damaging the nation even though the complicated challenges we face no longer seem to fit the republicans narrow set of solutions they march onward in lockstep with their unyielding and ineffective agenda but reality seems to be playing out much differently than their program allows for tax cuts for the rich cannot save the world and it

we should have a national passenger rail system and i want to see that that is a successful system and a system that we can modernize and make into one that is truly a part of our balanced transportation system several people have come to the floor in opposition to the amendment and pointed out how much money is expended by amtrak well yes indeed each of the last 3 years has been over 1 2 billion one year 3 years ago it was 1 3 billion but even at that level of expenditure there has not been enough money to even make a serious dent in the capital needs for the northeast corridor the northeast corridor which carries 50 percent of all of the passengers on our version of the national rail system so we are being quite unrealistic in the idea that some seem to have that it is possible to run a passenger rail system on the cheap the number of dollars that are being talked about here simply does not run even the innercity rail system those 24 lines that the bill purports to support as i have said earlier today the chairman has used an extremely blunt instrument on amtrak somewhat like the proverbial 2by4 between a mules eyes well the bill cuts out all federal subsidy on 18 longdistance lines which forces them to shut down but the cost of doing that is as the gentleman from ohio pointed out giving a more accurate number than i gave i said 300 million he said i believe 369 million in costs that are just tb close down those lines in the first year and it continues for several years while those costs of abrogating contractual arrangements and labor costs would continue that plus already the debt on amtraks capital debt the debt service on amtraks capital debt would be another 275 million and growing those two items by themselves end up being more than has been suggested for funding by the bill so the bill is a shutdown of amtrak it is not a reform of amtrak that is really for the authorizers to do over time what the amendment does as has been proposed by the authorizing committee and i commend them for putting together a set of offsets which are difficult but not nearly as difficult in dealing with amtrak as the proposal is in the bill what they have done is completely funded offsets within the authorization committees area and they are the ones ultimately that are going to have to figure out how to come up with a bill that in the long run provides a national passenger rail system and reforms it which does not have to be by the basis of cutting out all of these longdistance lines the lines that are cut out shown by that map that everybody has seen cuts out all passenger rail service in 23 states representing 154 members of this house of representatives and 46 members of the other body that is just not a realistic position and the position which the authorizing chair and the ranking member of the authorizing subcommittee have put forward is a position that still requires reform because that number of dollars in the long run does not fully fund a functioning and efficient national passenger rail system i support the amendment that has been put forward by the gentleman from ohio and the gentlewoman from florida both states

wonder how the callously efficient armtwisting regime that he installed in the house has crumbled so quickly the sheer audacity of trying to pass a budget reconciliation bill that provides more tax breaks to the wealthy at the expense of important socialnet programs for the poor is unbelievable the programs slated to be cut include health care for veterans medicaid student loans and child support enforcement the idea that americas republican leaders would slash funding for veterans the day before they should be honoring them would be even more appalling than it already is if it were not so commonplace in fact this pattern has repeated itself throughout president bushs tenure in office the unitedstates invasion of iraq in march 2003 coincided with the sharp decrease in veterans health care and other benefits for those who have bravely served in our nations military the backlog at veterans hospitals had never been greater than when the united states went to war in iraq now with more than half a million soldiers having served in iraq the burden on the va will only increase and while the unitedstates has spent over 200 billion for military operations and reconstruction in iraq over the past 2 years during this same timeperiod the bush administration and the republican congress have repeatedly refused to provide veterans with the benefits they have earned and the benefits they deserve our nations socalled leaders have continually refused to fix the system called concurrent receipt whereby veterans health beiefits are deducted from their retirement benefita

move me i came away from the trip absolutely awed by our soldiers they were even more committed more dedicated and more courageous than i had ever imagined having met and talked with them it pains me to the core that their fate rests in the hands of leaders who have failed them time and time again the men and women who wear the uniform deserve so much more they deserve civilian leaders who will put their safety before their own political interests they deserve leaders who would not send them to iraq on false pretenses on a poorly defined mission without all the tools they need and without a plan to get them out of there and they deserve leaders who will give them adequate medical and financial support when they come home for all the reasons i have mentioned today it is time to bring our troops home from iraq we need to focus on healing the wounds incurred over the last 22 years of war and administering to americas domestic priorities if we want to truly honor our veterans on veterans

concerned about the state of affairs in america we are concerned about the debt the deficit the budget and we are committed to trying to restore some common sense and fiscal discipline to our nations government and our nations budgeting process ever since i was a small child growing up in prescbtt emmet and hope arkansas i always heard it was the democrats that spent the money and yetit was a president named bill clinton from arkansas from my hometown of hope arkansas in fact that gave this nation its first balanced budget in 40 years from 1988 through 2001 america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having its fiscal house in order america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having a balanced budget it is hard now to believe that from 1998 through 2001 this country had a balanced budget because as we all know for the sixth year in a row this nation under this republicanled congress and under this president this administration has given us the largest budget deficit ever ever in our nations history for a sixth year in a row as a matter of fact as you walk the halls of congress it is easy to spot a fiscally conservative democrat because the 37 of us who belong to the blue dog coalition have this poster outside our office in the halls of congress as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 365 525 832 151 and some change that is a big number let us put it in a way that we all can understand it for every man woman and child including those born this 1ast hour every citizen of americas share of the national debt is 28 000 and some change where i come from very few of my constituents can afford to write a check for 28 000 and yet it is this kind of debt this kind ofdeficit that we are saddling on our children and grandchildren and expectingther someday to pay back and i believe it is morally wrong i raise these issues because you see my grandparents left this country better than they found it for my parents and my parents left this country better than they found it for my generation and i believe we have a duty and an obligation to try and leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for the next generation but instead for the sixth year in a row we have the largest budget deficit ever inour nations history this administration this republican congress continues to pass tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year just in the last few months this congress passed the socalled budget deficit reduction act here is~what it did it cut medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor disabled and elderly it cut student loans and a program for orphans to the tune of 40 billion and then they passed another tax cut to the tune of about 90 billion i was not real good in math in high school or college but you can do the math on that some 90 billion in tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year 40 billion in cuts to medicaid to orphan programs and to student loans that amounts to 50 billion in additional debt and yet the republican leadership in this body had the nerve to call it the deficit reduction act i believe it is time for those of us in the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition to rise up and hold this administration this congress responsible for these kinds of reckless spending habits that destroy future generations the budget the president has submitted for fiscal year 2007 some 2 8 trillion you have to givelit to him he has managed to cut all of the programs that matter to people health care education infrastructure economic development and yet give us the largest budget deficit ever in our nations history all at the same time how does he do that because he continues to propose to borrow money from foreign lenders foreign central banks foreign investors to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year what has it given us it has given us a debt of 8 365 525 832 151 by the time we complete this hour the national debt will have risen more than 41 million every tuesday night those of us in the blue dog coalition we are 37 members strong we come here to talk about the debt and the deficit and what it means not only to todays generation but to future generations because you see these are big numbers they are big numbers but let me put it in perspective not only is our nation borrowing about a billion dollars a day we are sending 279 million every day to iraq but do not dare ask the president how he is spending it or if he has a plan for how it is to be spent because he will tell you that you are unpatriotic some 57 million is going every day to afghanistan and on top of that our nation is spending the first half a billion we collect in your tax money each and every day simply to pay interest not principal just interest on the national debt we need 149 in my congressional district i need 1 5 billion to complete it give me 3 days interest on the national debt i can build 149 on the eastern side we are waiting on 169 give me 3 days interest on the national debt and i can complete 169 and with these two interstates we can bring economic opportunities and jobs to one of the most depressed and distressed areas of the country these

a rallying point on a bipartisan basis to do something for the american people when we defeated this bill in november it cut health research college loans and lowincome energy assistance it cut assistance to working families and the unemployed by almost 4 percent and at a time when america is falling behind competitors like china whose economy is growing three times as fast as ours it cut worker training that bill failed by a bipartisan vote of 209 to 224 what about the bill is so different this time that it warrants passage very little indeed this bill is at the same funding level simply shifting money from one underfunded priority to another if anything once you consider the additional 1 4 billion in cuts that the republican leadership intends to impose with a 1 percent governmentwide acrosstheboard cut this bill is worse i understand that the chairman and his staff are doing their best i do recognize that this bill includds many programs that the president had slated for elimination especially in the area of education and community services bl6ck grants but his is an impossible mission he has been asked to craft a spending bill with resources that do not even allow for us to meet last years levels with inflation and why and why not because america cannot fund these priorities we are the richest country in the world rather it is because the republican

about a dirty little secret contained in this budget resolution that all members ought to be aware of the secret is the offloading of our federal financial problems onto our states as a strategy to reduce our nations budget deficit the hypocrisy is clear through the preemption of state laws and in spite of a littleused federal law that prevents unfunded mandates on states congress has arrogantly chosen to do just that and that is to offload on our states do the states have the ability to fill that gap well the national council of state legislatures has identified the minimum gap in federal funding to states caused by unfunded mandates in 2004 fiscal year as being approximately 25 6 billion in the fiscal year 2005 the amount rose to 26 2 billion evidence by the national council of state legislatures shows that this gap will continue over the next decade and could grow as high as 50 billion annually and we offload our financial responsibilities to states and let them be on their own the evidence is clear it does not take into accoulit inflation and other changes in discretionary spending over the next decade i ask my colleagues to recall recent history in the 1980s and in the 1990s president reagan a former state governor understood the necessity of a bipartisan effort to protect the states president clinton another state governor codified that recognition of states by signing the unfunded mandates reform act in which the congress pledged to no longer continue this practice of passing laws and then telling the states it is your job to figure out how to pay for it but this white house also currently occupied by another former state governor and many of my colleagues who serve in congress over half who come from state legislatures i believe have forgotten where

appreciate the gravity of the situation facing many doctors the rising cost of insurance poses obvious dangers for access to care particularly for populations most in need unfortunately the republican leadership has brought to the floor a bill that does not reduce premiums for physicians and imposes an arbitrary cap on damages for the most severely injured victims of malpractice or negligence capping noneconomic damages at 250 000 for patients who have won a medical malpractice tort will not result in lower insurance premiums for physicians just listen to what the insurance industry itself has said we have not promised price reductions with tort reform said dennis kelly an american insurance association spokesman in the chicago tribune in fact over the past few years payouts for medical malpractice cases have remained flat while premiums have continued to rise in some cases doubling because of insurance companies overcharging doctors for insurance the fifteen largest insurers have accumulated a surplus that is double what they actually need to pay claims we should be debating how to most effectively rebate this surplus to the doctors rather than looking for ways to reward them for the squeeze that they are executing on our healthcare system the insurance industry is gouging medical doctors and is trying to use patients as a scapegoat imposing a cap on damages inherently affects the patients most severely injured by malpractice or negligence setting the cap at 250 000 is an insult to all those who have had their lives permanently changed by med ical errors the figure is lifted directly from the 1975 california micra law adjusted for inflation this amount would be close to 1 million in 2005 dollars 250 000 does not come close to compensating for loss of life or

should be about doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people that is the utilitarian way it is worth noting that if a society only did what was the greatest good for the greatest number of people that society would kill off the elderly who were no longer productive and kill off the young who were not likely to ever be very productive that would also be a society that did not spend

medicaid prescription drug plans have a number of tools at their disposal to ensure that ed drugs are not abused and could be covered only when prescribed for medically appropriate care further since they are not sold over the counter and must be prescribed by a physician control is not difficult medicare covers many benefits in some situations and not others and ed drugs would only be another

entitled to such wholeness after prostate cancer treatment ed drugs help men who have lost sexual function as a result of medical conditions like prostate cancer diabetes multiple sclerosis parkinsons

interrupted and i appreciate the gentleman yielding thepoint is that both sides in the old rules both sides could shut the process down the difference is and it is a huge difference the members would be hanging out there and with no resolution and the gentleman is incorrect and misrepresents the process the process starts with the ranking member and the chairman looking at the facts as presented to them by the person charging the member and then they decide whether to submit a recommendation to the full committee to proceed further and what action should be taken so the facts the gentleman is talking about start with the ranking member and the chairman then a recommendation is submitted just like a da would submit a recommendation to a grand jury and this is the grand jury process to the committee and the committee makes a decision whether they go forward now what happens in practice is if that member that has been charged receives from the committee that they are moving towards an investigative subcommittee that is a huge hit on that member whether he is guilty or not the press run with it and all kinds of things happen as the gentleman perfectly knows so that step to go to an investigative subcommittee is a very very important step and that is why the speaker thought it was really important that a bipartisan yote be made in order to get to that step it starts with his own ranking member making a decision in concert one vote to one vote with the chairman whether to submit the recommendation to the committee to proceed and that is where the gentlemans concerns can be taken care of as to whether it is going to be blocked one way or another then once they have made that recommendation if they make a strong recommendation to proceed to an investigative subcommittee i guarantee you because you have a republican chairman and a democrat ranking member the committee is going to follow their recommendation more times than not and you will have a bipartisan and in many cases a unanimous vote to proceed to the next step the problem is and it is a real problem that was used where you come to a deadlock then there is no resolution for the member that has been charged

number of retirees has been risinlg faster than the number of workers and fact without reforms social security is not sustainablq in the long run the system is not in crisis the system is not in limbo

is very important to speak to the american people for this brief moment by telling them of a story of a young woman i saw in a hospital in germany who had just been shipped from iraq she was burned from head to toe she laid in a hospital bed and yes as a soldier she was valiant and courageous and her only concern was for her mother i use that example because we have heard it on the floor tonight how our soldiers want to go back into battle and how our soldiers want us to have the resolve to stay the course but it is our responsibility as members of congress and policymakers whenever we send our soldiers into battle we must send them for the right reasons we heard tonight that the american intelligence did not prove there were weapons of mass destruction in fact there were none that the troops are in fact fodder for the insurgents and health care is no longer promised to our soldiers coming home that we are now sending troops that are at the c4 level the lowest state of readiness 50 000 may suffer from battle fatigue it is important that we stand together for a solution to bring our troops home i voted no against the hunter resolution because it was not a serious debate it was
