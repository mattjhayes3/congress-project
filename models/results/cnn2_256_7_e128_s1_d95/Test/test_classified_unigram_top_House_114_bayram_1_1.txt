way today because we were all horrified at what happened in paris at what happened in beirut at what happened to the russian airliner to name a few recent incidences we recognize that that is horrible and that we have to protect the american people from it to do so we must be strong but our strength must also spring from our prayerfulness for those who lost their lives or for those whose security was threatened physically emotionally and in every other way in our country we have a relationship with france they were our earliest friends that is why in this chainber of the house of representatives any visitor can see there are only two paintings one is of our great patriarch george washington our hero our founding father the other painting in this chamber is of the marquis de lafayette it is in recognition of the friendship that the french government extended to the colonies in our war for independence just imagine george washington and lafayette a long long friendship so while we are concerned about violence wherever it exists in the world when paris was hit in such a vicious way in some ways it hit home for us not that the other lives were not equally as important as we come to the floor to talk about what we do next we take an oath of officeevery one of usto protect and to support the american people and the constitution of the united states keeping the american people safe is our first responsibility it is the oath we take if the american people arent safe what else really matters we understand the concern the fear in the country when an act of terrorism strikes in fact that is the goal of terrorists to instill fear to instill terror we cannot let them succeed so we have to take the measures necessary to protect the american people and to be very strong in how we do it that is why i have a problem with the bill that is on the floor today it is because i think we have a much stronger better option to protect the american people and that is in the form of the thompsonlofgren legislation unlike in the republican bill the democratic alternative applies tough scrutiny to all potential refugees not just to syrians and iraqis as the republican bill is limited to the thompsonlofgren secure refugee process act would require the secretary of homeland security to verify the identities of all refugee applicants any application that contains insufficient conflicting or unreliable information would be denied from day one the bill also requires that at least five federal agenciesthe department of homeland security the attorney general the federal bureau of investigation the secretary of state the secretary of defense the director of national intelligencecheck all refugee applications against their records any application that indicates a national security or a criminal threat would be deniedall not iraqsyriaall two former secretaries of homeland securitysecretary janet napolitano and secretary michael chertoffhave written about the process that is in existence now and which the thompsonlofgren legislation respects the process that is currently in place is thorough and robust and so long as it is fully implemented and not diluted it will allow us to safely admit the most vulnerable refugees while protecting the american people fortunately they say these goals are not mutually exclusive there are other things that we could be doing in a bipartisan way and i would have hoped that that would have been a place we could have gone with this one of them relates to closing loopholes in the visa waiver program today our colleagues on the senate side are putting forth their principles which state if an isis recruit attempts to travel to the united states on a fraudulent paper passport issued by a country that participates in the visa waiver program that individual would avoid biometric screening and an inperson interview how could we allow this loophole to exist if we are truly addressing this challenge in a comprehensive way if the republicans want to make the nation safer in the face of terror there is another clear area in which we should act and that is we should be voting on republican congressman peter kings bill in order to close the appalling loophole it is outrageous that a person who is on the terrorism watch listlisten to this if someone is on the terrorist watch list he could walk into a gun store and buy a gun his bill is called the denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act the visa waiver close the terrorist gun loophole according to the gao over the last 11 years more than 2 000 suspects on the fbis terrorist watch list bought weapons in the united states did you know that ninetyone percent of all suspected terrorists who tried to buy guns in the united states walked away with the weapons they wanted over the time period with just 190 rejected despite their having ominous histories listen 5 to 1 10 to 1 they were able to get these guns why cant we talk about guns when we talk about danger to the american people it is outrageous that we would be slamming the door to mothers and children while we still allow people on the terrorist watch list to walk in the door of a

kind of assumption is wrong there is nothing shoddy going on the administrative conference of the united states found most endofterm rules related to routine matters or were issued in response to

provisions of dubious constitutionality specifically this bill exempts from collective bargaining requirements any action taken by an agency head to limit restrict or prohibit access to a web site

proceed to final passage as amended i rise to speak in support of the democratic motion to recommit that would protect the civil rights of students at schools that receive vouchers by requiring the schools to certify that they provide each student with all applicable civil rights protections the d c voucher program calls into question multiple federal civil rights protections and turns a blind eye to the governmentfunded discrimination for example religious schools that accept vouchers are permitted to discriminate on the basis of religion in hiring a violation of traditional principles prohibiting discrimination based on religion when using federal money the fact is that most religious schools are part of a ministry of the sponsoring church and these schools either cannot or will not separate the religious content from their academic programs so it is impossible to prevent a publicly funded voucher program for paying for these institutions religious activities and education furthermore schools that accept vouchers are allowed to discriminate based on gender in admissions a violation of the principles of title ix in addition to the discrimination based on religion or sex the d c voucher program also raises serious concerns about the civil rights of students with disabilities idea requires that schools that receive federal idea funds provide appropriate education to all students with disabilities but at least one study found that the schools that accept d c vouchers serve students with disabilities at a much lower rate than public schools failing to meet the needs of students with disabilities is just one of the shortcomings of the d c voucher program but another issue is the performance of the school a 2010 department of education report concluded that the use of a voucher had no statistically significant impact on overall student achievement in math or reading additional studies found that students from schools in need of improvement have shown no improvement in math or reading due to the voucher program furthermore participating in the voucher program had no impact on student safety satisfaction motivation or engagement many of those who actually won a voucher cannot use them because the voucher does not cover the full cost of attending a private or religious school as a result many who win a voucher find that they cannot use it because they cant afford the remaining cost of the education so studies have confirmed that fewer than 25 percent of the students who use the vouchers are from schools that were in need of improvement the d c voucher program fails on all counts it violates principles of traditional civil rights laws it makes no improvement on student achievement and it fails to reach the very children it was designed to help our public schools need more funding not less rather than funnel taxpayer funding to private or religious schools that lack civil rights protections and fail to meet the goals of

returns and many americans including me are concerned about the irs ability to take information from americans without their consent or without a warrant sometimes that includes emails so lets talk specifically about the concept of government seizure of emails without consent of the person who sent it or received it and without a warrant current federal law is that if somebody has an email within 6 months of when that email was sent that email to be obtained by governmentnot just law enforcement but any government agencythey have to get a warrant to seize that but as soon as that 160 days runs past 160 days the government doesnt get a warrant because the law doesnt require it i think in the spirit of the fourth amendment the fourth amendment should require that email what is email that is an electronic message sent to another person lets go back to regular mail or snail mail which some people call it if i write a letter and i seal the envelope and i put the postage on there and i send it go put it in the mailbox one of those blue mailboxes and i drop that in the mailbox the government does not have the authority to go in that mailbox and take the letter out read the letter seize the letter without a warrant so it flows through the united states postal system from wherever to wherever and it lands in somebody elses mailbox that mail generally speaking is protected under the fourth amendment because it violates the fourth amendment if government seizes it and goes into the contents without a warrant the same should apply to emails it is communication it is just done electronically but the law does not allowlet me say it another way if emails are over 6 months old americans should be aware of the fact that government may seize those emails from a private company without your knowledge without your consent and without a warrant that is why i have introduced along with representative zoe lofgren from california that the law should be that emails are protected that it is a right of privacy and it is an expectation of privacy for americans that emails be protected and that government should be getting a warrant before they seize those documents because it is a violation at least in the spirit of the fourth amendment i hope that that legislation does finally come to the floor and we get a vote on protecting the fourth amendment the right of privacy for americans when it comes to emails the same applies not only just to emails but under the circumstances it would apply to geolocation devices that the government knows where you are i think the government to keep up with you needs a warrant to stalk you throughout the united states the third thing i wanted to mention in the remaining time is a completely different issue but it has to do with drones the right of privacy we are in the drone age it is estimated that by 2030 we will have 30 000 drones over the skies of the united states 30 000 of them drones are a marvelous invention they are highly technical they can be very small you can get one at a local store that you can put in the palm of your hand no question about it there are good uses for drones right now the law is that the faa regulates the use of drones throughout the united states it may permit some it may not permit may refuse to permit them it is a bureaucratic decision by the faa congress needs to weigh in on the issue of drones and set down constitutional guidelines people need to know the rules law enforcement needs to know the rules and private citizens need to know the rules about their use of drones and basically the fourth amendment ought to apply to the use of a drone except with the exigent circumstances that already apply to the fourth amendmenthighspeed chases disasters fires et ceterabut we need some guidelines on the issue of drones congress has the responsibility to protect the fourth amendment of the surveillance of americans by either law enforcement or by private citizens and develop a standard for both law enforcement and for private citizens to know what the standard is yes there are reasons why we should use them and the law should allow those but congress needs to make the decision not the faa i have a local sheriff or the sheriff in texas where i am from he generally says he doesnt want to use drones because he doesnt know what the courts are going to decide down the road as to whether or not that use of a drone was a lawful or unlawful violation of the fourth amendment so rather than wait for the courts to decide if this specific use is or is not a violation of the fourth amendment congress needs to come up with guidelines about the design and the protection of the fourth amendment that drones can only be used in certain circumstances otherwise they are not allowed to be used because they violate the fourth amendment of the united states so those are three issues that have the right of privacy that are being i think chilled today because there is more and more government intrusion into all of those areas into the massive data of phone information information that is put on your iphone for example that is being seized can be seized without knowledge without warrant the massive amount of emails that can be seizedwe really dont know how much is being seized because over 6 months your personal email is not protected by law government agencies not just law enforcement can seize thatand then the skies will have 30 000 of those drones there needs to be some regulations within protection of the fourth amendment and we need to work with industry and government to outline what those rules ought to be to protect the fourth amendment protect the right of privacy of individuals to be secure in their homes in their papers and their effects from government intervention and government intrusion congress should set the standard for what a reasonable expectation of privacy is especially in those areas that i mentioned and the one regarding drones as well so i hope that we see some movement in this legislation once again zoe lofgren and i have introduced legislation as well as others to protect the right of individuals to be free from searches of their emails after 6 months without a search warrant we have that legislation pending as well hopefully we can rein in what i call the stalking government about stalking american citizens america is not about keeping up and following every citizen in the united states by government that is what other countries do that is what countries like the soviet union used to do that is

affect our lives she is partially responsible for my being behind this microphone a woman named elanor benson from fountain hills died last weeki believe at age 95and she changed my life i was a 20 21 maybe 22yearold kid i was selling real estate in our little town as a way to finance my way through arizona state university at night she in her retirement at that age decided to take on another job at our little office she sat me down and she knew i had an interest in conservative politics i still to this day remember her looking at me and saying david i like you you are going to be the next president of the local republican club i tried to explain to her there was no way i would have time for such a thing and she looked at me and said dont worry i will help this is a woman who moved to our little community on the side of scottsdale i believe in the late seventies and had such an impact for years i used to believe maybe a third of the townhalf the townhad become involved in politics mostly republican politics because of her passion her energy you could not stop her she got me to be president of the local club and stood by me when i did dumb things and applauded me when i did good things and scolded me when i didnt say the right things and walked me through how to be more sensitive instead of being so caffeinated which is a family problem i realized in the chaos of doing this job that i failed to tell her how much i loved her and how much she affected my life because i dont believe i would be here today if it werent for elanor benson who not only changed my life but who actually i believewith her work at the fountain hill chamber of commerce her work for so many causes her work for her churchmade my community a much much better place we are all better in our part of arizona because of her life it was a life well lived it was a long life she was beautiful to the day she passed and i wish i had let her know how much we cared so elanor if you are out there thank you

occur the rapid dissemination of critical timesensitive information is essential and the national blue alert system would provide that in new jersey and across our nation regardless of what aspect you

in particular the rule is selfimplementing meaning that it does not require permits to be issued and the federal government will have no authority to enforce epas standards the best way forward is to create a statebased permitting program with minimum federal standards this legislation does just that taking many of epas requirements and folding them into state permitting programs the program created by this bill would give states the flexibility to meet their unique conditions and empower state agencies to enforce environmental and safety requirements that will protect communities and the

i would like to thank my colleague congressman sanford bishop of georgia we have had many meetings in washington as well as back in the district on this particular issue certainly i have enjoyed working with him on it todays vote marks an important milestone in many years of effort to bring about increased recognition and enhance cultural preservation of the ocmulgee national monument the ocmulgee national monument was originally authorized by congress in 1934 to protect the old ocmulgee fields which includes a network of very wellpreserved indian mounds of great historical importance the history of the fields can be traced back to native americans who first came to the site during the paleoindian period to hunt ice age mammals the park is unique in that it vividly displays the story of many stages of prehistoric cultural development including the mound builder period and highlights the important role of agriculture in the region i am proud to represent this area of middle georgia along with congressman sanford bishop our offices have worked along with many regional community partners to advance this goal by expanding the current ocmulgee national monument from 700 acres to over 2 000 acres and redesignating the area as a national historic park this legislation will provide significant economic educational and cultural benefits to middle georgia additionally h r 482 will reauthorize a study for future expansions and include increased opportunities for hunting fishing camping and other recreational activities the expansion of the ocmulgee national monument area provides for critical preservation of additional archeological locations through the old ocmulgee fields because of its significant historical and archeological importance the future ocmulgee mounds national historic park must be preserved the expanded park also will generate additional tourism in middle georgia while educating visitors on the fascinating history of the many civilizations that have thrived in the region however it should be noted that the property in the proposed expansion area would be acquired only from willing donors or sellers using private funds and that no federal dollars will be used to achieve expansion i want to take this time to thank chairman bishop and ranking member grijalva as well as all the members of the house committee on natural resources

serve in that dutyand i think it was a good point if this were a private business and the private business had behaved this wayin the face of the irsthe ceo would have been fired because it just would have been absolute hell for the company and that is one reason why the american people are so frustrated with government there are different standards that apply for people in washington versus the rest of the american people and the taxpayers and that is just totally intolerable in a republican form of government and i make one other point that i think sometimes gets lost when you start talking about what are impeachable offenses people tend to think of it in terms of criminal offenses and while there are criminal offenses that would qualify as impeachable offenses the two are not mutually exclusive and in fact the founders believed that the real reason you needed impeachment was for things that may not necessarily be criminal but that were breaches of the public trust joseph story the preeminent supreme court justice noted that impeachable offenses are aptly termed political offenses growing out of personal misconduct or gross neglect or usurpation or habitual disregard for the public interest they must be examined upon very broad and comprehensive principles of public policy and duty i think that is tailormade for this instance some of the false statements maybe do violate

substandard program to other areas as you have heard including rural regions of our nation where these new rates will oftentimes not even cover the cost of the delivery of the item or the service
