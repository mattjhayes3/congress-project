for more than a generation the reach of this amazing prelates influence extended well beyond poland with the advent bf the papacy of john paul ii who at his inauguration indicated that it was because of his mentor wyszynski that the roman catholic church has its first polish pontiff 0 this symbol rept sents the time of day during the house proceedings e g o 1407 is 2 07 cardinal wyszynski spent much of his priestly life under the harsh anticlerical tyrannies of nazism and communism yet thanks to his brilliant leadership the polish catholic church today is far stronger than it was when he became primate of poland in 1949 in fact i believe it is fair to say that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the worlds attention has been riveted upon poland as we all know there have been moments when it appeared soviet intervention was imminent miraculously that has been avoided to date and much of the credit for that must go to cardinal wyszynski always able to keep things in perspective he skillfully served as a bridge between labor and government in a manner that inspired the confidence and trust of both parties i had the distinct honor and privilege of cochairing with our colleague clem zablocki the presidents delegation to the funeral of cardinal wyszynski the other members of the delegation were his eminence john cardinal krol archbishop of philadelphia aloysius mazewski president polishamerican congress the honorable

billion many of these programs provide funds for a wide range of construction projects including social service health centers libraries lowrent housing police stations vocational education training schools recreation facilities small infirmaries nursing care homes and day care facilities however the federal agencies responsible for administering the programs do not require state and local jurisdictions that request funding for new construction to routinely consider the feasibility of renovating available vacant or underutilized schools to meet their needs such a requirement could increase the opportunities for making effective use of vacant schools and result in significant savings to the federal government because there may be opportunities for substantial cost savings by using more vacant chools in lieu of new construction the gao believes and i concur that an evaluation of the feasibility of using such schools should be required before construction funds are awarded

the congress placed additional management and reporting requirements on the department of defense as outlined in the fiscal year 1981 defense authorization act these requirements were intended to prevent the department from using contract services to circumvent civilian ceilings however as importantly the bill directs the secretary of defense to report to the congress any intention or decision to contract out commercial or industrial activities during testimony on the fiscal year 1982 defense authorization bill witnesses indicated that in some cases performance by the contractor has been less that acceptable when this occurs it adversely affects the ability of both the base and unit commander to accomplish their missions one of the military witnesses indicated that contracting out in

study as soon as funds are made available the potential effects of actual construction of the prairie bend project upon the habitat of the sandhill cranes and the endangered whooping crane is an important issue the area downstream from the proposed project area is a prime habitat of these graceful and magnificent birds and of course any adverse impact upon that area must be given the most serious consideration before any project can be authorized in fact during committee consideration of this bill i supported an amendment to specifically require a detailed study of those effects even though i was confident that the environmental impact statement associated with the feasibility study would do so in the absence of such an amendment one particular aspect of the bill the costsharing arrangement by which the local sponsoring agencies have agreed to accept a substantial portion of the cost is a significant step for the congress to take in authorizing feasibility studies for water projects the willingness of the potential beneficiaries to bear that cost is indicative of the strong support in the local area and will serve as an example for future project sponsors that they will henceforth be expected to contribute to meeting the cost of these projects and the associated studies the adoption of this bill by the house as well as the previous bill marks the dawning of a new day in water resource development with the inclusion of these costsharing provisions with these comments i urge my colleagues to lend their support to the passage of this measure under suspension of the

management and development block grant act h r 5543 sponsored by congressmen jones and damouns and endorsed by the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries establishes a fund to provide coastal states with a means to maintain ocean resources management and development i am a cosponsor of this legislation and as a representative from maine and a resident of a coastal area there i believe the concept embodied in h r 5543 is a significant one the bill establishes a stable source of funding to insure the continuation of important coastal and marine resource programs that serve both national and state interests as the need for management of our coastal and ocean resources increase it is essential that we give the relevant agencies adequate financial support so that the goals of the coastal management laws enacted by congress can be carried out this proposed legislation gives the states and federal government the opportunity to continue the essential partnership which was established in the coastal zone management act of 1972 and which congress has since recognized as an internal part of ocean resource management the partnership initiated in those laws has led to a balanced and coordinated decisionmaking process that sets up guidelines for a variety of activities occurring in the coastal zone the fisheries conservation zone and on the outer continental shelf h r 5543 includes provisions that insure the continued funding of the coastal zone management act and the national sea grant college program which are the cornerstone of national oceanrelated planning and research activities these laws were enacted in response to rapidly increasing pressures on this nations coastal resources which have not diminished in any way since then in fact in view of the recently approved outer continental shelf accelerated 5year leasing plan i would submit that the pressures on our marine resources are greater than ever as multiple and competing uses take place in areas of national concern or under federal jurisdiction states coastal and marine resource management agencies inevitably become deeply involved in addressing national concerns maintaining federal support of programs such as coastal zone management and sea grant as proposed in h r 5543 is an entirely appropriate role for the federal government to play the money allocated through the ocean and coastal resources management and development fund will be transferred to the states through an already wellestablished program that was set up to help the coastal states handle the pressures of a federal activity offshore drilling that federal activity now seems to be a top federal priority and we cannot ignore the impact this has on coastal communities the czm program is a very diverse one and each federally approved state program is designed to meet the needs of that particular state to obtain federal approval the state plan must take into account the national interest and also coordinate activities with local governments and the public this program therefore represents the necessary and important balance among federal state and local concerns and presents the rare opportunity for communication so that as many of those interests as possible can be recognized the resulting programs now acquired by 27 states and territories focus on the review and analysis of ocs exploration and development plans assessment and analysis of the impacts of proposed uses of marine and coastal zone resources expanded enforcement responsibility in all areas of environmental concern and resource management in the coastal zone and expanded biological research activities again i do not think it is appropriate for the federal government to turn its back on these projects especially at a time when accelerated offshore leasing is certain to generate additional state concerns we cannot simply say that we are no longer concerned with offshore fisheries problems or the impact of energy development on the coastal zone because in doing so we will damage the partnership we have so carefully crafted h r 5543 establishes a fair and equitable method of providing a continuing federal role in that partnership it must be recognized that our marine and coastal resources need to be conserved and managed and that this must be considered as a policy of importance the enactment of the 200mile limit law in 1976 represents the unitedstates claim to jurisdiction over the resources out to 200 miles and the appropriate conservation and management those resources impact heavily on coastal areas the entire nation benefits from the planning that occurs through existing laws h r 5543 recognizes in its funding formula the need for congress to pay heed to existing pressures on coastal communities as well as planning for future activities i urge my colleagues to support h r 5543 so that we may in fact recognize and address the needs of coastal communities e"],

consideration of the first budget resolution the house spoke very clearly in adopting the oakar amendment to that resolution that it would not tolerate budget reductions in the medicare program today i am introducing legislation which will asture the solvency of the medicare trust fund by injecting general revenues into that fund these general revenues would be generated by repeal of some of the most outrageous provisions of the internal revenue codethose relating to tax preferences for oil producers and royalty owners we have a moral commitment to the health of our nations older citizens and medicare is perhaps the most significant and important federal pro gram helping to fulfill that commitment today 26 million older persons and 3 million disabled persons depend on medicare to help meet their health care costs sixty percent of these beneficiaries are older women as important as medicare is it only meets between 33 to 40 percent of the health needs of older americans clearly significant reductions or added outofpocket costs for beneficiaries would be a tragedy for many of our neediest elderly and disabled citizens i believe it is the height of folly to look to reductions in medicare benefits in order to cut federal expenditures when at the same time we have wholesale giveaways to oil companies existing in our tax code there are a number of provisions some of which passed last year as part of the economic recovery tax act that have little if any economic justification and which should be repealed i am proposing that the revenue collected by closing these loopholes be specifically earmarked and directed to the federal hospital trust fund from which medicare is financed last year i joined the gentleman from new york peter peyser and 74 of my colleagues in proposing to repeal those sections of erta which amended the windfall profit tax act by exempting 2 barrels of oil per day3 starting in 1985for royalty owners reducing the tax on newly discovered oil from 30 to 15 percent over 5 years and exempting stripper oil by independent producers altogether from the windfall profit tax these three provisions will cost the treasury 1 962 billion in 1983 2 333 billion in 1984 and 2 995 billion in 1985 for a 3 year total of 7 29 billion the bill i am introducing today would also repeal these provisions these massive unjustified exemptions for royalty owners and producers were motivated by nothing more than pure political gamemanship certainly not by economics or sound energy policy in addition to the repeal of the erta provisions i am also proposing significant changes in two other provisions of the codethe percentage depletion allowance and the expensing of intangible drilling costs under percentage depletion independent producers and royalty owners are given an option accorded to no other taxpayers in our country they may choose cost depletion which is essentially like straight line depreciation available to all taxpayers holding capital assets or percentage depletion which allows a deduction of 18 percent of gross oil related iricome with certain restrictions since percentage depletion can be used for whatever number of years the oil well continues to produce we are left with the outrageous result that total deductions can far exceed the taxpayers investment if it could be demonstrated that percentage depletion led to greatly increased production of oil perhaps it could be justified however economists question whether percentage depletion has any stimulative effect at all on the production of oil even worse the drain on the treasury is tremendous 1 5 billion each year in 1983 and 1984 and 2 2 billion in 1985 for a 3year total of 4 2 billion another preference accorded the oil industry is the allowance of expensing for intangible drilling costs idcs include drilling shooting and cleaning the well draining road making stirveying and geological work in preparation for drilling construction of derricks tank pipelines necessary for drilling and preparatiop of the well for production in any other context costs like these would be treated as capital expenditures and depreciated over the useful life of the asset or perhaps some other reasonable fixed period of time which bears some relation to its useful life however idcs can be expensed in the first year which results in a tremendous tax deferral opportunity for the oil industry although the 1976 tax reform act restricted the use of idc expensing the tax preference is still very much in existence analysis by the joint economic committee has concluded that the major oil companies who comprise 70 to 75 percent of those using this device can absorb the increased tax without a shortage of capital if the expensing option were eliminated the cost to the treasury due to idc expensing is staggering 3 5 billion in 1983 7 7 billion in 1984 and 8 4 billion in 1985 for a 3year cost of 19 6 billion the total in foregone revenue represented by these provisions equals 6 962 billion in 1983 11 533 billion in 1984 and 13 595 billion in 1985 for a 3year grand total 32 09 billion all the figures i have cited were generated by the joint committee

background of experience in both local government and the private sector in the relatively short span of 4 years wayne has played a very active and effective legislative role in congress it has been my good fortune to have worked closely with wayne on the public works and transportation committee he has been a particularly valuable member of our aviation and water resources subcommittees having served as a fighter pilot in world war ii wayne has had a special interest in aviation his experience and expertise in this area have enabled him to make an important contribution to the cause of a safe and efficient airport and airway system wayne brought to the public works and transportation committee and to the post office and civil service committee on which he has also served a firsthand knowledge of public works transportation and other needs facing the cities and towns of america that background also served him well as a member of the suburban caucus and the travel and tourism caucus with his extensive knowledge of local transportation needs it therefore was only natural that wayne should play a key congressional role in important transportation projects such as the century freeway project which provides for the construction of a roadway through the very heart of los angeles county eventually to connect the east and west sides wayne grishams world war ii experience which included being shot down over germany and becoming a prisoner of war undoubtedly helped shape his great appreciation for and commitment to a strong national defense and he has worked tirelessly and effectively to that end throughout his service in the house wayne has also built a strong record in support of fiscal responsibility in government a balanced budget lower taxes less government intervention and a reduction in both government spending and excessive regulation he has pursued his concern for reducing government regulation as a very active member of the regulatory reform task

his special insight into the problems needs and potential of aviation particularly general aviation and his vast legislative experience in this area have proven invaluable to the development of sound legislation to insure the growth of a healthy national airport and airway system of course barrys record of accomplishment ranges far beyond the scope of public works and transportation he has been

congress and most importantly in the minds of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who like myself were so privileged to serve with this outstanding legislator clair burgener began his public service on the san diego city council and the state legislature where he gained a reputation for performance and followthrough this reputation followed him to washington where he has become one of the most distinguished and respected members of congress in recent history on many an occasion i have heard people say that if there is a tough job to be done and you want the job done wellcall on clain burgener and he will see it through while i served as dean of the california republican delegation clair burgener took on a very special assignment as our representative on the allimportant committee on committees his sense of fairness and very constructive approach afforded us with results that far exceeded our expectations to say that he has earned our deepest admiration and respect is at best an understatement his position as secretary of the house republican conference is further testimony to this fact clair burgener has a richness of character that has afforded him unique access to the personalities particpating in the political process which has proved to be instrumental in his service as a key member on the house appropriations committee in that capacity clair will leave a legacy of energy and water projects such as santa margarita and the special initiatives in addressing reclamation reform which will stand forever as living monuments to the service of this very distinguished and congenial gentleman from southern california with all of these responsibilities and commitments clair burgener always made time to address our shared concerns for the handicapped and retarded which gained him recognition with a national constituency all of his qualities are based on a lifelong adherence to the christian ethicqualities which will leave a deep impression on me as i reflect back on our relationship clam and his lovely wife marvia both radiate the kind of goodness that makes them the kind of people you are very comfortable to be around while most of us have committed the golden rule to memory clair and marvia have committed it to their lives we of the california delegation and yours truly are proud to have them as special friends it gives me great pleasure yet a shared sadness in paying tribute today to one of my distinguished colleagues of the california delegation the honorable paul mcclosicey jr it is a great pleasure to recall the many years we have

suggest that further action is necessary the 20 billion trade deficit with japan that the united states will incur this year is staggering and demands attention the intricate web of excessively stringent customs product standards and testing requirements of the japanese economic system accounts for a substantial portion of this deficit and i suggest that only the removal of these barriers will open japanese markets to an acceptable degree i believe that although the japanese governments proposal is a step in the right direction toward a japanese market open to foreign products the actual change will be little more than superficial the proposal primarily affects industries involved with cosmetics pharmaceuticals processed foods and sporting goods and makes scant mention of hightechnology products such as data processing and telecommunications equipment i support the unitedstates trade representatives efforts to communicate to the japanese government that we will not be

gentleman from pennsylvania for his comments and also for sharing with the members of this house his special insight because of his prior experience one of the interesting things is the fact that many people who are affected by regulations do not realize that a regulation has the force and effect of law if a person violates a regulation they can lose a benefit be subjected to a penalty or indeed go to jail just as they could for violating a statute passed in the way we learned about in our civics courses in high school but those rules and regulations have never been considered or passed upon by anybody elected by the people of this country the fact of the matter is that the relationship the ratio between rules and regulations issued by unelected officials as comparedto laws passed by the congress of the united states is about 10 to 110 to l and yet for some reason we are unwilling or certainly so far imable to come to frips with making that process a more accountable process and the proliferation of these regulations several years ago i asked someone on my staff to bring to me the federal register in which these rules and regulations are published for a day i think it was about 10 ye rs ago they brought me a stack of books which was approximately a foot high i asked for the same books to be brought for the year 1980 it went over my head it was so high it was over 6 feet t 11 we have not only had a proliferation on these rules and regulations but as they have proliferated the people who issue them have become less and less sensitive to the american people less and less accountable to the american people i do not think it is asking too much to let the members of this house vote on legislation that would try to return to the american people control over their own government it is an opportunity for us to see democracy in action the worst thing that i think could happen is for there to be a perception that there is some reason some unexpressed reason why we are having to drag out and pull out like pulling teeth the opportunity to vote on something that a majority of the members of this house have already supported and that the other body has passed by a unanimous vote is there something that is so bad with a bill that we cannot even vote on it which was supported by the two senators from your own commonwealth of massachusetts i do not think so i acknowledge the fact that all of these things take time and i appreciate the fact that you and members of your staff are actively working on this matter and are pursuing with diligence i hope the effort to bring this matter to the floor but as each day goes by as each grain of sand falls down through that hourglass that ticks toward the end of this session questions have to be raised as to whether we really are going to have an opportunity to deal with this i would hope so i ask my colleagues in this house an overwhelming majority of whom support this legislation and have cosponsored it to understand that at the clerks table there is a discharge petition no 17 which is available for members to sign and when 218 members have signed it we will have an opportunity to vote on it i would hope quite frankly that we do not get to that point that is not the best way to consider legislation but this is legislation which has been reported out of a committee in the house the other bill the legislative veto bill was in a prior congress reported out of a committee of the house it is not a question of legislation that has not been consid ered i think we have come to the time that this legislation has to be voted on and i would hope it would be voted on with the blessings and the help and assistance of the leadership of this house because that is the best way to do it but however we have to do it i think that the american people are entitled to have this issue considered voted upon and i have no doubt of the outcome it will be passed and it will become part of the laws of this nation and i think that we will see over the years as a result that the american people will once again realize they do have control over their own government"], [0.0016644299030303955,

bill known as the service industries development act this new version is designed to achieve the same purpose as the previous bill h r 3848 that is to promote and encourage attention to trade in

services trade policy in the previous bill this function was largely carried on by the department of commerce as a result of the maze of jurisdictions in the house of representatives that bill was referred to five separate standing committees of the house i do not readily recall any bill referred to five separate committees that has ever passed in any recognizable form the new draft results in the bill being referred to just the ways and means committee and foreign affairs it is certainly not my intention to eliminate any input or ideas which other committees of the congress may have on this legislation indeed i believe that the ways and means committee now has a special obligation to consult with other committees to receive their ideas and inputjust as it so successfully did during the consideration of the trade agreements act of 1979 nevertheless by getting the bill referred to just two committees i believe that there is some prospect some possibility that the bill can be considered in the near future it is important that this bill be enacted services has become the most rapidly growing least understood and most successful of our trade sector for example in 1980 services such as banking insurance education consulting data flow et cetera accounted for almost 30 percent of our total trade and provided the united states with a march 3 1 982 h 662 co surplus of more than 34 billion we are the most heavily servicesoriented nation in the world the service sector employs about 7 out of every 10 americans and creates some 65 percent of our gnp with such an advanced and sophisticated servicec sector it is only natural that it is a positive addition to our trade balance yet there are enormous barriers to the export of various services and it is important that the administration seek to reduce and eliminate as many of those barriers as possible so that the united states can continue to develop its comparative advantage in this sector as ustr ambassador william brock recently said at the davos switzerland european management forum on february 1 the highly complex and rapidly developing service and investment sectors are par ticularly vulnerable to emasculation by nontariff barriers the tokyo round did not address those problems some of the most ingenious and insidious nontariff barriers didtst even exist at the time of the tokyo round the passage of this legislation can insure that the proper attention management and government organization is given to the study and development of services trade issues so that the united states can begin to enter into negotiations in this sector successfully for example it is my understanding that at the gatt ministerial meeting this autumn the united states is likely to stress the importance of the services sector to do this however we require that the government continue to collect analyze and improve on its serv ices trade data and the problems facing services exports for the sake of our

policies preventing emigration and threatening those who wish to practice their religion for those who do not consider the sovet government a threat to all individual liberty i urge careful attention to the case of anatoly shcharansky following his initial request for a visa anatoly lost his job soviet authorities made it extremely difficult for him to marry by refusing to grant permission for a

struggle he faced 3 years of repeated harassment and surveillance by the kgb along with vicious attacks in the soviet press his wife remains waiting for him in israel shcharansky was imprisoned for
