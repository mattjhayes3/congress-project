does little to make our communities more livable by approving this document we are ignoring the negative effects this budget would inflict on the health of our communities our infrastructure and our economy for the next decade if i had my way i would place more priority on paying down the debt saving social security and medicare avoid costly new tax cuts and unnecessary unfocused defense spending and develop a capital budget to account for infrastructure investments for a more livable future however this budget resolution doesnt extend the solvency of those trust funds by a single day and instead of paying down the debt offers tax cuts that primarily benefit those who need help the least it also calls for unlocused increases in some aspects of our military spending without assurances that any of this spending will increase our overall security an example of this is the call for new star wars spending an unproven system on which weve already spent over 60 billion in research with nothing to show for it it fails to give americas communities the tools they need to improve their quality of life the building livable communities initiatives embodied in the administrations budget offered increased choices for citizens in the areas of transportation housing regional planning open space preservation education and crime control the democratic alternative recognizes the importance of these initiatives through a sense of the house resolution i believe we have a responsibility to do all we can to have the federal government be a better partner with communities and citizens in their efforts to improve very basic components of everyday lifegetting to work and school safely ensuring the quality of the water we drink and the air we breathe and having economic opportunities for the future it should also be noted that longterm budget projections are nearly always miscalculated and have been overly optimistic by over 200 billion on average over the last 15 years even small errors and changes in the economic picture can drastically alter what the government collects and spends a forecasting error of as little as 2 can alter the budget balance by as much as 70 billion annually future military conflicts slower economic growth stock market fluctuations decisions by the federal reserve currency values natural disasters and any number of other variables can also radically alter what the government spends and takes in therefore it is unwise to push massive tax cuts years down the line when it is impossible to know what our economic situation will be only by remaining fiscally cautious now and investing in americas infrastructure can we make this a budget that helps make our communities more livable this proposed budget would be a disaster if it were implemented it siphons nearly a trillion dollars into tax cuts paid for with painful and unnecessary budget cuts while ignoring key investments that need to be made in education social security and

5 billion this bill would end our commitment to hire 100 000 new teachers and to reduce class sizes i am concerned by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited english proficiency these funds support the training and retraining of bilingual teachers the disparities in minority education will be increased if

find jobs this bill also cuts adult job training for almost 40 000 adults the cuts in adult training programs equal 93 million or 10 percent below the request and 2000 levels finally this bill

a healthy neighborhood if we are in a community that is free from vandalism it is a sign of a healthy neighborhood if there are areas that provide access to walkways and sidewalks that are away from the rush of traffic it shows respect for the residents we are in a healthy neighborhood if we have opportunities to move away from the blight that has been a plague for many communities and there is

this deadline this year however it is also true that keeping our fiscal house in order does take a little longer than the freewheeling bigspending days of the past because we must ensure that all funding is spent efficiently and where it is needed the most the conference report before us this afternoon not only holds the line on the presidents additional spending requests but also responsibly funds areas important to every american citizen and protects the american people from waste fraud and abuse across the entire federal government earlier this year the republican congress made a commitment to end the 30year raid on social security and according to the congressional budget office we have now completed that task the president began the budget negotiations by taking a large step toward our position on the social security issue and joined us in locking away every penny of social security we worked with him in a bipartisan fashion to protect retirement security we were determined to protect american seniors and this congress and its leadership denied any piece of legislation on the house floor that spent one penny of it to achieve our goal of protecting american seniors and responsibly funding important programs we are including in this bill a plan to direct every federal agency to reduce spending by less than onehalf of one percent 38 percent of 1 percent by routing out waste fraud and abuse surely the government can save less than about half a penny out of every dollar this republican congress is simply asking those who run federal agencies to make fiscally responsible budgeting decisions with the money taxed out of our paychecks we all know the agency directors and executives know where the waste is and i am relatively certain they will be able to weed out at least that much in savings with this sensible plan in addition to meeting the fiscally responsible objectives this conference report also ensures that our principles of quality and flexibility in the funding for teachers have been met in the laborhhs section of the bill this congress ensures that funding may no longer be used to hire unqualified teachers provides that schools will have more flexibility in using their funding for improving the qualityof uncertified teachers and increases the amount of funding that may used for professional training for teachers the administration pushed for a onesizefitsall mandate in which washington controlled the 100 000 new teachers program not every district needs new teachers some need bettertrained teachers other districts need books hightech equipment and updated math and reading programs i think it is foolish for the washington bureaucracy to tell every school district in america that washington knows best how to spend tax dollars to educate our children the debate in washington is not only about money it is also about how that money should be spent this bill moves us closer to the right balance of education funding by providing additional funds for americas students through programs like pell grants and special education while lowering the bureaucratic burden imposed by washington through

there here is what we expect american taxpayers to pay what is going to happen when we start taking out some of our young men and women in body bags one question i had to dr kissinger is why is nato willing to commit 24 000 of their troops his answer was partly the unitedstates demand and the unitedstates initiative we can not be the police force for the world we can not keep spending the social security trust fund money one day if we are not careful we will not even have these options of helping those in need while some remain optimistic about the potential peace agreement i have serious reservations ethnic albanian leaders in kosovo have said that they will settie for nothing less than independence serbia refuses to sign an agreement which dismembers the country as dr kissinger stated the projected kosovo agreement is unlikely to enjoy the support of the parties involved for a very long period of time the long history of the ethnic conflict in the balkans makes a lasting peace in kosovo unlikely with or without a nato presence if our goal is to quell the hostilities that have persevered for centuries than we will find ourselves in the same situation that we face in

have more troops deployed to hostile regions now than during the cold war dr kissinger made the point that each incremental deployment into the balkans is bound to weaken our ability to deal with saddam hussein and north korea if nato intervenes with troops in kosovo the unitedstates can assist its nato partners with communications and intelligence support and back a political strategy aimed

by political decisions rather than on the basis of merit it is a political institution osha does not get campaign contributions based on how they rule a lot of members of congress do get campaign

others use 90 percent of net pay the fact is when osha comes down on the side of using 90 percent of net pay that is virtually the same as using 75 percent of gross pay the gentlewoman in my view is simply confusing the issue when she tries to suggest that there is a great variance here but what is really at question is this in the washington post article this morning we have a very interesting

corruption in washington indeed political corruption is a problem but todays reformers hardly offer a solution the real problem is that government has too much influence over our economy and lives creating a tremendous incentive to protect ones own interests by investing in politicians the problem is not a lack of federal laws or rules regulating campaign spending therefore more laws wont help we hardly suffer from too much freedom any effort to solve the campaign finance problem with more laws will only make things worse by further undermining the principles of liberty and private property ownership the reformers are sincere in their effort to curtail special interest influence on govemment but this cannot be done while ignoring the control government has assumed over our lives and economy current reforms address only the symptoms while the root cause of the problem is ignored since reform efforts involve regulating political speech through control of political money personal liberty is compromised tough enforcement of spending rules will merely drive the influence underground since the stakes are too high and much is to be gained by exerting influence over government legal or not the more open and legal campaign expenditures are with disclosure the easier it is for voters to know whos buying influence from whom theres tremendous incentive for every special interest group to influence government every individual bank or corporation that does business with government invests plenty in influencing government lobbyists spend over a hundred million dollars per month trying to influence congress taxpayers dollars are endlessly spent by bureaucrats in their effort to convince congress to protect their own empires government has tremendous influence over the economy and financial markets through fnterest rate controls contracts regulations f6ans and grants cortorations and others are forced toparticipate in the process out of reed as well s selfdefeie since thats the way the system works equalizing competition and balancing power such as between labor and business is a common practice as long as this system remains in place the incentive to buy influence will continue many reformers recognize this and either like the system or believe that its futile to bring about changes and argue that curtailing influence is the only option left even if it involves compromising the liberty of political speech through regulating political money its naive to believe stricter rules will make a difference if enough honorable men and women served in congress and resisted the temptation to be influenced by any special interest group of course this whole discussion would be unnecessary because members do yield to the pressure the reformers believe that more rules regulating political speech will solve the problem the reformers argue that its only the fault of those trying to influence government and not the fault qf the members who yield to the pressure or the system that generates the abuse this allows members of congress to avoid assuming responsibility for their own acts and instead places the blame on those who exert pressure on congress through the political process which is a basic right bestowed on all americans the reformers argument is stop us before we succumb to the special interest groups politicians unable to accept this responsibility clamor for a system that diminishes the need for politicians to persuade individuals and groups to donate money to their campaign instead of persuasion they endorse coercing taxpayers to finance campaigns this only changes the special interest groups that control government policy instead of voluntary groups making their own decisions with their own money politicians and bureaucrats dictate how political campaigns will be financed not only will politicians and bureaucrats gain influence over elections other nondeservers will benefit clearly incumbents will greatly benefit by more controls over campaign spendinga benefit to which the reformers will never admit the media becomes a big winner their influence grows as private money is regulated it becomes more difficult to refute media propaganda both print and electronic when directed against a candidate if funds are limited campaigns are more likely to reflect the conventional wisdom and candidates will strive to avoid media attacks by accommodating their views the wealthy gain a significant edge since its clear candidates can spend unlimited personal funds in elections this is a big boost for the independently wealthy candidates over the average challenger who needs to raise and spend large funds to compete celebrities will gain even a greater benefit than they already enjoy celebrity status is money in the bank and by limiting the resources to counterbalance this advantage works against the noncelebrity who might be an issueoriented challenger this current reform effort ignores the legitimate and moral political action committees that exist only for good reasons and do not ask for any special benefit from government the immoral political action committees that work only to ripoff the taxpayers by getting benefits from government may deserve our condemnation but not the heavy hand of government anxious to control this group along with all the others the reformers see no difference between the two and are willing to violate all personal liberty since more regulating doesnt address the basic problem of influential government now out of control neither groups deserves more coercive government rules all the rules in the world cant prevent members from yielding to political pressure of the groups that donate to their campaigns regulation cannot instill character additionally the legislative debate over campaign finance reform has seemingly focused upon the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech as interpreted and applied by the courts the constitutional issues however are not limited to the first amendment to the contrary pursuant to their oaths of office members of congress have an independent duty to determine the constitutionality of legislation before it and to decide before ever reaching the first amendment whether they have been vested by the constitution with any authority at all to regulate federal election campaigns congress has no authority except that which is granted in the constitution thus the threshold question concoming h r 417 is whether the constitution has conferred upon congress any authority to regular federal election campaigns the authority to regulate such campaigns is not found among any enumerated power conferred upon congress more regulation of political speech through control of private money without addressing the subject of influential government only drives the money underground further giving a select group an advantage over the honest candidate who only wants smaller
