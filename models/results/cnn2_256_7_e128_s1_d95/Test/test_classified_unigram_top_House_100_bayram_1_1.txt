opportunities super tuesday helped when it took the name of dick gephardt out of this bill unfortunately super tuesday didnt kill super 301 in which the ragged spirit of mandator retaliation limps on economists tell us that twothirds of the trade deficit is because of our federal fiscal and monetary policies my colleague mr gephardt himself said unfair trade practices account for only about 15 to 20 percent of our trade deficit this mandatory retaliation section is antifarmer it paints a big red bulls eye on the farmers forehead and gives our trade partners a perfect excuse to pull the trigger despite these high levels of purchases this bill orders the president to take retaliatory action for all practices deemed unjustifiable at about the same time will the bills proponents tell us how many of these retaliation actions section is going to require in the first 2 years of its life there is a waiver for the action but it is to be used in extraordinary cases and only where the adverse impact on the unitedstates economy is substantially out of proportion to the benefits of action note the language assumes adverse impact will occur and must be tolerated this is absurd how much ag sales do we have to loose for a reaction to be substantially adverse would chinas cancellation of a 500 million in wheat sales in 1983 for our blockage of just 50 million in textile imports be substantially adverse we have a tough problem on japanese and korean beef we have the right position and we are holding their feet to the fire but getting them to open these markets is difficult what

satisfied our production to being an exporter a net exporter of wheat and it is my understanding that india today is a net exporter because of american expertise because of scientific development of wheat that we gave to them because of the goodness in the hearts of americans because we wanted to help starving people with no strings attached no requirements for votes in the united nations no quid

other than simply a country in which a majority of the people work their will because if the majority of the people work their will against a minority and oppress them and kill them and persecute them then they are not a true democracy the oppression of the sikhs in india has demonstrated that india is not a democracy in the sense that it does not protect its minorities and that isthe hallmark of

consideration of the military construction appropriations bill h r 2906 and like almost all appropriations bills this year with one exception maybe two at the most this rule is replete with waivers i mean do you havea problem with the bill if you are from appropriations or an authorization committee whatever you might have a problem with we will waive any and everything just bring it to the rules committee and we will flush you right on through let me tell my colleagues what this rule waives it waives the budget act it waives legislation on an appropriations bill it waives availability of the bill for 3 days i mean we really do not want to know what is in these appropriation bills do we why should we need 3 days or 3 hours three minutes is probably all we really need of course we waive the rule that requires that hearing committee reports be available for 3 days we waive the 302 c which prohibits the rule because it prohibits consideration of legislation from a committee that has not filed its 302 b suballocations i do not know what is going on in the appropriations committee i thought they were ready to file those suballocatlons days or weeks ago apparently there is some wrangle up there but do not worry about it the rules committee will take care of it we will waive any requirement of that nature that might be imposed by 302 c it also waives of course the fact that we have numerous instances of unauthorized appropriations in fact it was interesting as i looked over the bill the committee apparently pays no attention to what was requested what was authorized they go up in some areas down in others i could not figure out what the rhyme or reason to it was but that is all right we waive that too then also in section 2 of the rule we lay the hud housing and urban development appropriation bill on the table i do not see any great damage being done with that we lay the rule on the table i have not seen it done before in all of the years i have served on the rules committee i guess it is so that a member of the rules committee will not call up that rule after a certain number of days and since the gentleman that is chairman of that subcommittee is involved in hearings over across the capitol that we did not want it just sitting there until he could come back and handle the rule so i do not have any big objection to it except it is unusual and now the rules committee will have to go back and have another hearing and grant another rule let me talk about the bill itself this subcommittee of the appropriations committee the military construction subcommittee as is the usual case does a better job than any of the other subcommittees of the appropriations committee their level of spending would be 8 1 billion and that is 1 8 billion below what the president asked for and very close to last years level there is some dispute over that i had seen a figure that it was actually 70some million under last years level and i have seen a figure now that says it is 140something million over last years level it is very close and i guess it depends on whether you count the previously appropriated funds as to whether or not it is right on it right above it or right below it but overall the subcommittee did a good job in fact this subcommittee probably did too good a job this is the only subcommittee of appropriations that i have seen that has kept spending down it is probably the only one that should have allowed some spending to go up the rest of the bills have been 1 2 billion 1 8 billion 2 billion several hundred milion over everybodys request and everything else that we are supposed to be using as a guidepost but this one is within range of what was asked for so i must say to the subcommittee they have done their job and done it well so i do not mean this criticism of the rule to be aimed at the appropriators in this particular instance i just think the rules committee is too quick to pass out waivers

something that i often quote in speeches when i am out on the stump when i am dealing with people that relate to the banking industry because we all know from the debate that we had here just a couple of evenings ago that there certainly is a great deal of question surrounding the financial services industry i always quoted stewart said you know our ranking member of the housing subcommittee and a guy who always reminded everyone in committee how many years he had served as a member of the banking committee has said when we look at the problem of trying to turn the corner on the delivery of financial services what weve got to do is take representatives from the savihgs and loan industry the commercial banking industry the investment bankers the insurance industry the brokerage industry the real estate industry lock them all in a room give them nothing more than bread and water and when they come out with a consensus well mark up a piece of legislation i heard stewart tell that story many times in committee and i have had the privilege of quoting that many times around the country in speeches and he is absolutely right because we have been seeing so many challenges over the years in that area and while it has been frustrating for me as i am now on my seventh year dealing with that issue stewart served many years longer and he was facing that on a daily basis his independence was shown to me not only with all the great arguments that he had provided from the well of the house but as i regularly looked at the man who had the largest fleet of convertibles of any human being i have ever known any of us walking back and forth from the votes would see stewartunfortunately because his health was failing chauffeured back and forth in one of his vintage convertibles and he loved collecting them he told me about one of his trips to california and he said gosh david i broke down while i was out there and even rented the new mustang convertible which has just come out i said stewart if you had just told me that it was a mustang i would have known that it was a convertible because it seemed that that was all he ever drove i really will miss stewart he was a great friend to me provided me with a great deal of inspiration and as my friend from connecticut john rowland said earlier he was a teacher to a great many of us i said that i philosophically did not always agree with him but because there was that lack of agreement on a number of issues and because we shared the same cloakroom it only intensified the level of debate my deepest sympathies to lucy

passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country this legislative body and all of our lives much richer than we would otherwise have known without the opportunity and privilege of calling sala burton a very close and special friend"],

provided to many of us speaking as one of the members of congress with the least seniority to the gentleman from texas one of the highest seniority members we appreciate that and we appreciate the

authorization bill to the house floor today the programs and activities of noaa are extremely important to us all the chairman of the science committee mr roe mentioned a recent tragedy that occurred in eastern texaswhere several people were killed and more than 100 injured this scene is familiar to me and to those of us whose districts have suffered devastation as a result of natural catastrophes a few years ago the worst series of tornadoes to strike the southeastern united states in 60 years claimed 59 lives and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage in northand south carolina these tornadoes were personal tragedies for the many thousands of people whose property was damaged or destroyed and who unfortunately lost loved ones many of the communities in our state were left totally devastated many factors contributed to this situation among them based on a field hearing held in my district after the tornadoes by the natural resources agriculture research and environment subcommittee were the lack of stateoftheart weather forecasting technology the lack of appropriate staff at the regional airport and thelack of coordination with media and local public safety officials i believe as do many of those who experienced the tragedy that many if not most of those deaths could have been avoided if the appropriate technology and personnel had been available that tragic day and the recent occurrence in eastern texas should be a painful reminder that the weather services ability to predict and disseminate weather information is only as good as the technology in use certainly we cannot prevent the occurrence of severe and sudden weather changes we can however provide mechanisms to ensure that we can forecast these changes accurately and disseminate our predictions in a timely manner the bill before the house today provides such a plan the level of funds authorized in the bill will enable the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the national weather service to modernize its equipment and operations in both agencies to ensure better weather predictions and forecasts the legislation will also require noaa to develop longterm plans for the modernization of its weather services over the next 10 years these services are an essential part of our daily lives the bill also authorizes a number of other important programs as well above and beyond this the bill is fiscally responsible it is equal to the appropriation passed by the house in july it is 10 percent under the senate authorization bill for fiscal year 1988 and it is 17 percent under the senate authorization bill for fiscal year 1989 this legislation is critical to maintaining public confidence in government agencies aimed at enhancing public

about the bill that we face here the balance of this week i support the committee position on the military authorization bill we have reduced the figure from the 312 billion requested by the president of the united states this administration to a figure of 305 billion i happen to believe that that is sufficient i say that as one who voted for the bill which has caused us to have to make the sizable reductions that we are going to be hearing about in the next few days i happen to believe that a 288 billion defense budget is too much i think it is highly inadvisable i think in the aftermath of such a proposal if we did have to go that i think you would see some reductions in manpower certainly some significant reductions in weapons systems so i am prepared to support the committee position when we debate that in tomorrows session i want to speak also just briefly on the reserves the national guard in particular some 3 weeks ago it was my privilege to visit with other members of congress some of our troops in central america the plane that we went down there on belonged to the air national guard the d c air national guard i have never been treated finer i have never flown with a more proficient crew and staff people i have tremendous respect for all our guardsmen but i want to particularly commend those who were responsible for this particular trip today 51 percent of all our infantry battalions are national guard troops some 48 percent of all our artillery are army national guard some 70 percent of our entire air defense is provided by the guard as you and our colleagues are well aware the congress has been a staunch supporter of the armys total force program whereby the combined capabilities of the active army the army national guard and the army reserves serve to accomplish the armys mission further in recent years the nation al guard and reserves have been given increased responsibilities all of this is good and it should contiue one part of the overall effort to in crease the overall combat capabilities of the guard and reserve have been to provide their technical units with modern weapons systems especially to those units subject to early deployment in the event of mobilization a case in point is the eh64 attack helicopter for the army national guard in fiscal years 1985 1986 and 1987 congress mandated that 18 apaches from each of those procurements be assigned to the army national guard it takes 18 apaches to equip one attack helicopter battalion the precedent is wellfounded and should be continued because of the combat mission of the national guard the fact is that over a quarter of the armys total quantitative requirements for the apache is for the national guard specifically in march of this year the army testified that the national guard apache requirement is 270 of the 1 031 aircraft the army would like ultimately to procure therefore i strongly endorse the action of the armed services committee which will allocate to the army national guard 18 apaches from the fiscal year 1988 procurement further i believe the congress should continue in future years to provide at least 18 apaches per year

high level of historical resource destruction cannot go unchecked the 8 years of experience since the passage of arpa have demonstrated that there are weaknesses in the law that make it extremely difficult to prosecute looters in fact there has been only one arpa felony conviction by jury since the law was passed because of the weaknesses in arpa federal prosecutors often resort to statutes other than arpa to prosecute archeological looters the compromise legislation before the house today makes four important changes to current law which will strengthen enforcement of arpa and significantly reduca the level of looting of americas archeological sites the first provision will change current law which requires that an artifact be worth 5 000 before the crime can be prosecuted as a felony the bill will lower the threshold to 500 to bring in many more artifacts second it will make attempt to excavate an archeological site a prohibited activity under arpa this change will allow the prosecution of looters who are caught digging but who havent yet retrieved ihe object third it will strike the requirement under current law that an artifact must be of archaeological interest this provision of current law only confuses juries and injects a subjective view of archeological resources into the courtroom fourth it will require each federal land manager to establish a program to increase public awareness of the significance of archeological resources this legislation will reverse the shocking increa3e in recent years in arche115866 ological site looling the

ive sat in hearings on longterm care home health for chronically ill or communitybased medicaid waivers for years and i chaired most of those hearings in my health subcommittee of finance we have waited for state experiments with home and community based services to give us policy guidance so far the experts advice is inconclusive so weve begun to introduce our own longterm care legislation ive introduced five s 1739 s 1832 s 1922 and s 2212 next week i hope to introduce the longterm care insurance protection act of 1988 as well mr president i will soon introduce another bill as part of a broad longterm care strategy that would deal more directly with the problems of longterm care today in the short term than would my earlier bills which would help build systems for the future this new bill would provide a mix of longterm care services balancing different needs and alternative systems of care it would build on social insurance principles and protect everyone but would recognize that those individuals who have resources adequate income and assets to preserve for themselves and their families would want to do so they would be able to help preserve their assets through private insurance and other savings and private pensions this bill will create a new federal program for longterm care it would increase home health care benefits covering chronic conditions for the severely ill or disabled it would also augment the respite benefit that congress just approved in the catastrophic bill both benefits would have small copayments for example nursing home coverage would be available after 1 months stay to cover the first 6 monhs of a nursing home stay with a 20 percent copayment and a 35percent copayment for someone with a spouse living in the community after 6 months individuals who are eligible for medicaid would begin to be covered by medicaid those who have resources and incomes high enough to be ineligible would use their private incomes savings and or private insurance to cover their nursing home costs medicaid savings that may accrue from these changes could be used to upgrade nursing home care and meet the new challenging nursing home quality standards this coverage would be eligible to all who meet the programs requirements that is where the patient is unable to do 2 of the 5 normal daily living activities for himself there are several ways to finance this program it would be budget neutral the elderly and disabled have long argued that they would be willing to finance this benefit if congress would only authorize it a 5 per month premium paid by the elderly would produce 1 8 billion in the first year higher premiums could be considered simple changes in the tax protection subsidy of high income health insurance can also provide

particular time in the prevention role we believe that the substitute which does a great deal to try to expand the protection of existing workers and prevent the kind of problems which we have been talking about today is much superior in that regard we do a number of things in our amendment which help the present workers we expand the coverage under osha to take in other areas to include thousands if not millions of workers in the transportation and the mining industries we also upgrade the z tables that is those tables which were established some time ago which have not been upgraded a list of those hazardous chemicals about which we are concerned here today we give the secretary authority to do that there are only 400 on that list today and there could be thousands on there after that is done we employ training to ensure that the workers in the plant and the employers know how to deal with the problems of occupational diseases and their causes the secretary is required to recommend monitoring when it is essential depending on the type of exposure we create the office of hazard communications in order to deal with a serious problem and ensure that we provide maximum protection to our workers present and future we do a great deal h r 162 all it does is by threat of litigation ask the employer to be so scared that he might do something we require him to do it under the regulatory process we also are concerned about the prior workers and our proposal has significant advantages over notification that is the im portant thing to me there has been a lot of talk about things which are really irrelevant to the key issues we say that rather than use the model which was a disaster the augusta experience and model the whole federal program and that program cannot go into effect for 2 years why not take that group of workers we already know who they are some hundred thousand that we know the kind of exposure they have had we know that they are being subjected to possible disease notify them and do it in a way that will be respon sible with the employers concerned and with the workers help them find out whether or not they do have a problem we would have those

colorado for his hard work and dedication on this bill frankly think for both of them this is a thankless tireless task there is not much political reward in it and they have both done a good job i just happen to side with the gentleman from colorado on my conclusion in developing this bill in committee and considering it here on the floor of the house we hae been presented with conclusive incontrovertible evidence that benefits for those in need of public assistance have declined dramatically in recent years and we have been presented with equally compelling evidence that even allowing for inflation the value of most benefit packages has actually in creased and weve examined indisputable evidence that most families receiving public assistance do so for a relativelybrieft period of time but then again we know that most families who are on welfare at any given moment will remain on welfare for a number of years simply put mr chairman there are studies and surveys and numbers andstatistics to confirm every prejudice or underscore just about anything anyone wants to believe about welfare but it seems to me that there are three fundamental principles on which all of us can agree the first is this over the years the federal government has devoted substantial resources to trying to help people find a way out of poverty and theres still a lot we dont know about the problem perhaps thats because we havent done enough even so i think its time to admit that the federal government doesnlt have all the answers secondly a welfare reform package can increase benefits or it can address dependency but it cant do both when you subsidize something you get more of it if the objective is to raise benefits thats a legitimate goal do so and say so but dont try to have it both ways dont raise benefits and pretend that the result will be diminished dependency and finally any welfare package worthy of the designation reform should target our limited resources to those who remain on public assistance year in and year out thats the tragedy we have to address"], [2.9206275939941406e-06, 0.500002920627594, 0, "i intend to talk more tonight about the problems in central america
