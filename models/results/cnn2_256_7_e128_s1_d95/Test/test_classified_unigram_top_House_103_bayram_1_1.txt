a heavy price in overhead h r 3841 seeks to rationalize interstate banking and branching regulations to eliminate unnecessary admiristrative requirements without compromising the safety and soundness of our nations financial institutions h r 3841 will strearrline these regulatory burdens by enabling banks to own branches and provide banking services across state boundaries without having to

exaggerated the cbo estimates that the total cost over 5 years is only potentially 12 to 20 million and that cost would occur only if some of the lands are aoquired by purchase instead of exchange in actuality most if not all of the lands acquired would probably be through exchange with very little cost to the treasury furthermore this bill promotes more efficient government and ultimately could and should save the taxpayer money it blocks up a checkerboard ownership pattern that has been hampering land managers since the turn of the century it is in the economic interest of both the adjacent private landowner and the federal government to consolidate the land ownership so that the land can be managed properly the bill also authorizes a severed minerals exchange currently the federal government owns the subsurface rights but not the surface rights on some lands and the surface rights but not the subsurface on other lands this situation greatly complicates land management the bill corrects this inefficiency by consolidating federal ownership so that the federal government owns both the surface and subsurface if we do not pass this legislation the difficulties involved in

western europe against soviet aggression additionally it is estimated that we have been spending almost 15 billion a year to defend the pacific and another 19 billion a year to defend south korea in the gulf war approximately 61 billion was spent by our allies and ourselves 3 billion a year to israel to assure that there is some democracy in the middle east is absolutely in our national interest with the unitedstates defense budget being reduced americas global force projection capabilities are more limited consequently our ability to respond quickly to regional crises is diminished it is comforting to know that we can count on israel to help us provide a vital swing force in the event our interests are at stake in the eastern mediterranean the arabian peninsula north africa or the suez canal strategic cooperation with israel will therefore continue to be a cornerstone of american defense policy israel has been called an island of democracy in a sea of hate the current peace negotiations between israel and her neighbors will hopefully stem the tide of that sea of hate and bring on full recognition of the state of israel and full peace however the arab nations have expressed the hope that the united states will deliver israel at the peace negotiations under the circumstances i do not believe that israels arab neighbors will make the compromises necessary for full peace unless they fully understand that america stands squarely behind israel reaffirming military and economic aid to israel will send the right message to the arab countries that they must negotiate in good faith and such aid will reassure israel at a time when she has offered to take considerable risks for peace while america has compelling moral political and strategic interests in continuing our foreign aid to israel we have vital economic interests as well the american people agree that aid to israel is in our national interest in january 1991 a cbs news new york times poll found that 83 percent of americans believed that america should maintain or increase its aid to israel despite the overwhelming public support for continuing assistance to israel the issue of foreign aid remains a favorite target for some pundits in the media as well as for some demagogues in the political arena the most frequently voiced argument against foreign aid is how can america ship dollars overseas in light of our pressing domestic problems and huge federal deficit a fair costbenefits analysis of our foreign aid program provides the answer at less than 1 percent of the unitedstates budget foreign aid is an investment in the american economy a real bargain for what america gets in return and a true jobs stimulus program for the american people and of all the foreign aid recipients the american taxpayer receives a greater return on his or her investment in aid to israel than from any other country here are the economic facts seventythree percent of all foreign military and economic aid is spent in the united states buying american products and providing jobs for americans in israels case 2 5 billionor 83 percent of the annual 3 billion in aid to israelnever even leaves the united states and is spent in 43 states buying american products made by american workers from 1987 to 1991 israel spent over 680 million in california in military purchases in 1991 israel spent over 200 million in california tens of thousands of californians have jobs because of foreign aid and because of aid to israel in particular over 750 california aerospace defense and hightechnology firms greatly benefit from the military assistance we give allies such as israel foreign aid has also dramatically increased our exports between 1986 and 1990 unitedstates exports to

and their staff will listen to the debate we are about to engage in on the goals 2000 education bill this is not a technical amendments bill this is not a reauthorization bill this legislation is breaking new ground with regard to the federal role in education and if enacted into law would be the first federal effort to improve all schools for all children in this regard i think it is critically important to allow the broadest degree of discussion debate and amendments i have been a part of the debate on the federal role in school reform from the outset the original school reform bill was a hawkinsgoodling bill in the 101st congress in addition i sit on the national education goals panel with mr kildee as representatives of the house members i also had a major role in shaping the kildeegoodling school reform legislation considered in the 102d congress the bill being considered today is the product of a 5year process to determine how the federal government can assist state and local school reform efforts without doing damage to the excellent progress being made across the country as you can imagine it is not easy for the congress to get involved in something as new and dynamic as the school reform movement without dictating what exactly we think everyone should or should not do generally the bill before you today is a good one it incorporates many of the ideas that president bush and lamar alexander talked aboet under the title of america 2000 it authorizes the national education goals panel to inform the nation about our progress toward the six national education goalswhich by the way we are never going to reach at the current pace it creates a process whereby national organizations of teachers and other educators can create descriptions of what all american students should know in the core curriculum areasvoluntary national content standards a grant program is authorized that would give states limited federal funds to carry out the activities associated with school reform efforts at least 75 percent of these funds would go to the school level to provide the wherewithall to make the systemic changes necessary to increase student learning from the start writing effective legislation in this area has been a balancing act by its very nature the school reform movement is a grassroots bottomup effort that began with and has been driven by states and schools across the country the lack of federal involvement up to this point has probably been a good thing the danger of federal assistance in this area has always been that congress form of help would be an example of what states were trying to get away fromuniform topdown regulation driven onesizefitsall solutions for the most part the bill sent to us by the administration avoided this pit fall perhaps because both president clinton and secretary riley had experience as governors actually implementing school reform the introduced bill was outcome oriented and generally nonprescriptive however as the bill moved through the committee amendments were added that made the bill unacceptable to the president secretary riley the governors the business organizations that originally supported the bill and most importantly the educators who are trying to implement these difficult changes i was pleased to hear that the substitute bill h r 3210 removes most of those objectionable amendments there remains some contradictory provisions in the bill relating to how prescriptive the federal government will be in requiring states to enforce their standards some of us including mr condit and myself feel that this lack of clarity in the bill could be interpreted to be a mandate on states to meet standards required by the act even though federal funds will never come close to covering it i believe that ours is really a clarifying amendment in that the committee report clearly states that there was no intention to create such an unfunded mandate on states the president in a letter to me on h r 1804 stated that t was not his intention to influence state fiscal priorities with this legislation the governors and chief state school officers support the intentions of this amendment further there has been some concerns raised about the effects of this bill on state and local control of curriculum and instructional practice our amendment clarifies the intent of congress in this regard as well it is very important that this amendment be adopted and made part of h r 1804 only with its adoption will many of us who share these concerns vote in support of the legislation with regard to title iv of h r 3210 establishing a national board for the development of industryrecognized skill standards i continue to have specific concerns over the lack of a leadership role provided in the legislation for business and industry due to the realization that unitedstates competitiveness is increasingly dependent on the skills of the american workforcebroadbased support has arisen for development of a national system of occupational skill standards in the united states while i support the development of such a system i am convinced that our success is dependent on making this an industryled effort otherwise the standards will not be used during committee consideration of the goals 2000 legislation we offered amendments to address these concerns unfortunately our efforts failed but our resolve has not while our concerns persist we will not offer any amendments to tite iv today dealing with the issue of industry leadership based on knowledge that a compromise is being developed in the senate that will address these concerns we understand that the senate compromise will make changes in the composition of the national board as well as require that the boards chairperson come from the business community for the first 2year terms it is our hope to work toward this compromise as we go to conference with the senate on the goals 2000 legislat on evep with these reservations i do recognize the fact that we have come a long way in addressing concerns originally identified in title iv of h r 1804 as introduced resulting in a much better piece of legislation finally i wish to note that while i am pleased that most of the very contentious civil rights issues raised by earlier drafts of title iv have been resolved i do have concern over certain language n the committee report the last sentence on page 50 which appears to require rigid adherence to the uniform guidelines on employee selection procedures and the standards of the american psychological association this very well may not be a correct reading but if it is i believe this will create problems for many reasons i believe the board should be allowed broad discretion in this area in closing madam chairman i am prepared to support this legislation with the adoption of the amendments i have just described it will be my goal in the conference to move the

tremendously responsible i would again like to congratulate the gentleman from new york who for many many years has kept the faith not only with the american people but with those men and women who went to vietnam to protect the interests of the united states of america and to fight for freedom when we gave our word to them the gentleman from new york did not forget and has kept the faith with them over the years i am very proud to be withthe gentleman here today to declare that september 16 should be a day in memory of our mia pows this issue has unlike the exemplary job mr gilman has done has been a disgrace on the part of so many american officials and so many elected officials as well i remember when i was a young reporter shortly after the mia pows were supposedly all returned i was a young reporter and interviewed richard nixon in los angeles i will never forget that interview because i asked him whether or not he was certain all of our mia pows had been returned from vietnam and he gave me a statement to that effect however after the interview i thought to myself the president did not give me any reason to believe that all of the mia pows were returned except that he was satisfied it seemed to me if he was satisfied and that was not just a public statement he would have given me reasons to believe that so i walked away from that interview so many years ago 20 years ago now saying you know i dont think he was telling me the truth i think he thinks there may still be some mia pows in vietnam the question we have to ask ourselves at that time why would the vietnamese have ever given up all of their leverage on the united states of america in order to give back all of those people who had been there bombing them and participating in the war agains t them i at that time the war was still going on in cambodia war was still going on in laos in fact a war was still going on it south vietnam there was every reason to question whether or not the vietnamese gave back all of those pow mias at that time we have heard over and over and over again these years that the communist regime in hanoi has been cooperative well itjust aint so the history of our dealings with hanoi in terms of our mia pow record is a record of deceit footdragging and manipulation it is a history of we ourselves bending over backward to give the very best interpretation of all of hanois actions it is a history of a mindset on the part of american officials to debunk the entire mia pow issue especially if there are any livesighting reports about possible powy mias still in the hands of the communists now are there still live pows especially after all of these years i happen to believe it is likely that they kept some americans after claiming they returned them all that does not mean these men would still be alive today i do not know if they are or not and i am not saying they were kept what i do know is that the american people have been lied to on this issue over and over again what i do know is hanoi has not been cooperating as we have been told on this issue less than a year ago i was up on the cambodianvietnamese border with our american pow teams out there in the jungle trying to find desperately working under horrible conditions having to cut landing pads out of the jungle in order to try to find a hospital where some of our mia1 pows were kept near the end of the war the trouble is hanoi could tell us the location of this hospital which was a major facility during the wax simply by having any one of the thousands of north vietnamese who were stationed at that hospital go to the scene and help our people locating it but instead our teams have been put through a grueling practice over and over again trying their hardest working long hours to find even the minuscule bit of information one of our own colleagues pete peterson of florida was held for 6 years as a prisoner of war on the way over to vietnam i asked petr if he has been a prisoner of war designated as a prisoner of war the entire time he was held captive he told me no in fact during the first 3 years of his captivity he was labeled as an mia meaning even his family did not know that he was being held captive by the north vietnamese during that time that he was kept there and i think this is important mr peterson was kept totally separate from all other americans no one knew that he was being held captive in fact had he been kept instead of declared a pow we would not have known he would have been there at all it is possible other americans were held in the same way i am not saying that is absolutely the case but that it is worth putting pressure on the vietnamese instead of bending over backward giving them the benefit of the doubt when i was with them negotiating this issue they told me that record that pet petersonthe prison in which he was held those 6 years were not available to us now those records could have disclosed to us whether or not there were other prisoners in this status listed as mia and being part of the prison population in fact we have not been given the record of any of those prisons that to me indicates the vietnamese have been deceptive we do not need to bend over backward in the powimia issue to normalize relations rush in with a trading relationship with people who are treating us with that type of arrogance i would say during this time period the one hope that any people have of actually coming to the truth to flnding out what happened in there in southeast asia to our mviapow s is to make sure we as american citizens keep the pressure up on our own government and on hanoi that is why this resolution today is so important that is why on september 16 i hope that all americans will fly their mia pow flags at their local libraries and people will come forward and give radio interviews and talk to other americans and others about the issue of nmipo ws we should never forget this war in vietnam we should never forget the lessons we learned there there are a lot lessons to be learned but most importantly never forget the men and women who marched off they placed their lives on the line for us

australian government wondered why last year the australians looked int9 the shipping industry i think the name of the report says it all ifs called ships of shame they found that the reason many foreign ships can bid low is because they ignore workers rigts and safe working conditions australia found that in the past 4 years ships were so badly maintained that 44 ships and 342 lives have been lost at sea they found case after case where seafarers were abused and exploited by officers they found that many ships keep two pay books one for official records and one for lower actual pay no

refused to go the german ship wouldnt sail into the war zone luckily we had an american crew to call in and they got the job done thats just one incident but if we allow our maritime industry to

o democratic reforms and huma rights i will include mr plan gans article in the record just a few days before mr chrii topher arrived in beijing the chines engaged in aroundup of dissidents on of the chinese leaders very candidl said at the end of mr christopher visit we would not have rounded thex up if we thought you were not going t want to talk to them here was an admission on the part a chinese leader that there was n cause to round these people up the had not broken the law but for fee that secretary christopher migt speak with them and hear their view < what was going on in china anywa my point is that just b fore secretary christopher got ther seven leading chinese dissidents ver courageously came forward and wrote letter to the beijing leadership ej pressing their concern about the rounc lng up of the other dissidents i believe that these seven dissident who wrote the letter were encourage by the congress of the united state by our president of the united state and the visit of secretary christophe that the world was watching and the there was some sense of security i their coming forth with their messagi i also believed that they were encoui aged by the actions of wei jingshen who was considered the leading d sident in china he served a long ion sentence for criticizing deng xiaoping he was released a few months befor his turn was up in order to rnmak points the chinese readily admit be fore the olympie committee vote o assigning the olympics which beijing as you know wanted and in their cym o ical act they released him a few y months sooner but they rearrested him before secretary christopher came 0 they have since released him but i d think that after serving nearly 14 years g in prison for attempting to speak freen ly for speaking his mind it did not it happen to be freely because he went to jail for it even after coming out of 0 prison he still spoke about human n rights and promoting democratic principles and criticized the regime so he e has been in and out of prison since even t the last few months a but anyway these seven dissidents z5 as i say encouraged by our position and by particularly wei jingsheng g that courageous man they wrote a let7 ter an appeal and a warning from 10 seven chinese id the following is the text of a petier tion to the government issued today by a group of chinese intellectuals and it is translated by the new york times s so lately there have been many incidents in which people have been arrested or dee talned in beijing and shanghai for interrogation because of theirideas and their exercise of free speech world public opinion has red acted strongly people of insight who are n concerned with the late of the naion and n who are dedicated to the cause of our countrys modernization are shocked upset and worried in looking at history we find that modern civilization began when humans awoke to elinlnattin the ideological con finement of ancient and medieval dictatoris ship and to becoming aware that humans 0 should have independent personalities and y dignity and enjoy nnailenable and inviolate 8 basic rights the first of which is freedom of n ideas and speech to talk about moderniza10 tion without mentioning human rights is like climbing a tree to catch a fish two hundred and five years ago the french declaraof tion of rights of man stated clearly that 0 being ignorant neglectful and disdainful of y human rights 4s the sole cause of the general r publics misfortune and corruption in govit ernment chinas history and reality have of verified that longstanding truth in the 1940s with the victory over the fascists it became common thinking for people the world over to diligenty seek an end to e preventing human rights in 1948 the united y nations adopted the declaration of universal a human rights i depart from the letter for a moment to make the point that what we are talking about in executive t order and on this floor is not about ind flicting american views on china it is 3 about the universal declaration of s human rights and the idea that we r subscribe to that human rights know 6t no boundary they are universal n e 1u2220 china by the way is a signatory to g the declaration of human rights as i mentioned earlier g the letter goes on to list what those g rights are which are basically freedom e of speech religion press assembly e and the right of workers to organize china was a founder of the united nations n and is a member of the security council it r should be a pioneer in abiding by all united k nations conventions instead of a target of international blame because of the issue of domestic human right for this reason we appeal to the authorities to bravely end our countrys history of punishing people for their ideas speeches and writings and release all those imnrisoned because o their ideas and speeches we believe that only after human rights are respected and all rights of citizens are secure will society achieve true stability otherwise contradictions will intensify causing unmanageable turmoil it was signed by seven intellectuals seven dissidents in china one of them xu lianying is a gentleman who translated the works of albert einstein we are talking about some of the great minds of china who understand that a society can only succeed if free inquiry is allowed to happen and freedom of speech one of the tragedies in china is that many of these dissidents when they are imprisoned and they have to sit on a stool for 14 hours a day and they are tortured and all of the rest one of the reasons they are tortured is they will not tell their guards and torturers what they are thinking so it is net only that you cannot speak freely when you are living in china or you cannot exercise the right of freedom of the press or worship or assembly or the right of thought they insist on knowing what you are thinking so that they can try to change your mind this is not a wholesome attitude i think anyone would agree i also want toi think he will save this one until we get toward the end i just want to get back po where we started on this i thank the gentleman from new york mr gilman for staying here i know the hour is late i said earlier very briefly that how we got to where we are in these last couple of months before the president must make an announcement about chinamfn many business people will say everybody has mfn so why should not china first of all everyone does not and china does not unless by june 3 ofeach year the president requests a special waiver granting most favored nation status to china this is because china is still considered a centralized economy and part of our most favored nation status law has in it the jacksonvanik requirement it is on the basis of that that we base the conditionality on human rights improvement in human rights for the renewal mfn in the congress of the united states in both houses we have had overwhelming votes in support of conditioning mfn in fact we have votes in favor of revoking most favored nation status but i think generally most people say we want mfn to continue if we can use it as leverage to improve the situation in china however president bush vetoed the bill every year and we could not override on the senate side we always did on the house side had the votes but not on the senate side but nonetheless always a strong strong majority in favor of conditioning mfn senator mitchell on the senate side if i may refer to the senate side and i in the house introduced the legislation last year president clinton preferred the executive order and frankly it was a good idea i think that the administration had because it gave us the opportunity to speak with one voice the house the congress and the administration on a policy which contained reasonable and achievable conditions for the renewal of mfn we must obey our law about jacksonvanik freedom of emigration and the laws prohibiting prison labor for export those conditions we could not weaken they are american law sothey are must meet conditions in addition to that the presidents executive order said that china must make overall significant progress which gives the president some latitude and frankly the chinese some latitude too to improve human rights in china and tibet specifically that they should move toward abiding by the universal declaration of human rights of the un of which they aem signers that they must stop jamming voice of america and they told secretary christopher on his visit that they were not intentionally jamming voice of america but there were some technical difficulties that made the jamming happen so hopefully we can work out those technical difficulties that does not seem to be a big problem to the chinese as they said to seoretary christopher we will see in the implementation of removing the technicalities the technical difficulties they have to cease to threaten the culture of tibet and one form that could take would be to agree to meet with his holinesa the dalai lama as he has requested they said they do not want to talk to him about independence since i have been in the congress since 1987 he has been talking about autonomy not independence and many of us here who worked on the tibet issue believe that there is progress to be made there that is reasonable and achievable it also talks about thei mentioned the prison labor but it talks about accounting for and releasing those people arrested in tienenmen square and democracy wall while peacefully demonstrating in addition to that that relates to the declaration of human rights because it talks about freedom of speech press religion my colleague the gentleman from new york imr gilman very carefully and scientifically spelled out some of the harsh penalties and the violations cf peoples right z f freedom of worship in china as i said earlier that is part of it we cannot go into all of it in one special order but it is a very very veryan issue of concern to many people in the congress whether they areof whatever denomination as well as the repression of the buddhist priests and nuns in tibet the point is that the conditions in the most favored nation axe reasonable and achievable that is why they are in there if they were not achievable it would be cynical to put forth an executive order that said we are putting forth conditions which are not achievable we purposely designed our bill calibrating it for renewal and the president took some of the conditions that we had and put in the bill as i mentioned earlier he wisely put the trade issues and the proliferation issues in a separate category where he said we would forcefully enforce our laws on that even though they are not part of the conditions of the bill they were part of the text of the executive order and for that reason i want to spend a moment on it why do we think we have leverage with the chinese and what is the situation with trade united stateschinese trade i think it is important for the american people particularly american workers to know that we arethe chinese as the expression goes are eating our lunch on trade they have preferential access to our market to the tune oflet me just read from the washington posti do not even have to read it because i know the fixtures there is about 31 billion dollars worth of trade of that they buy about 38 billion from us and we buy the 331 billion from them giving them a 324 billion trade surplus that means hard currency for the regime to stay in power what the american people and the american worker should know is that we have no reciprocal access to the chinese markets for the most part most american products made in america are not do not have market access into china they want aerospace electronics wheat some refrigeration these are good and those industries have been lobbying the congress and the president for the renewal of mfn without any conditions which is fine for them but what about the rest of the work force in america why should our products not have access to the chinese market when we hear people talk about this great growing market for the most part it is about products made in china an american business goes into china accesses cheap labor the minimum wage in most areas in china is 324 a month a month they access the cheap labor and they want to have access to the chinese market or they sell those products back into the united states that is the marketplace but it is not the marketplace if our products do not have the nontariff barriers they do not have the access back into china for products made in america so this whole thing about jobs is confined to a very narrow spectrum of jobs to the exclusion of a very broad spectrum of the american work force so there is great concern in this body about the issue of trade and that is just about market access in addition to that is the issue of transshipments in which the president the clinton administration very forcefully issued threatened to issue sanctions against china at the end of december and guess what china complied and reached an agreement on transshipments transshipments means as most of the members know that when a countrys quota is exhaustedin other words we allow z amount of chinese sweaters into the united states if they have exhausted their quota they have filled their quota they will simply sew in a label that says made in wherever some other place probably a place that does not make sweaters because they would have already used up their quota into the united states so they transship to another country but they have gotten a little more arrogant and have just been sending them directly with the labels but they are called transshipments for the reason i describe this is a billiondollar business the united states got the goods literally on china and with the threat of sanctions at the end of this year finally the chinese came to the table and agreed to negotiate but it was a very tough negotiation and i frankly think that absent this debate on mfn the chinese would not have been so willing because they knew this was at risk and at stake the other thing is prison labor for export we will probably have a special thing just on prison labor this is one of the vilest traditions because it is twofold they round up people they put them in reform through labor camps to reeducate them and change their thinking and then they have them make these products and we say those products should not come into the united states first of all they are made by prison labor which is against our laws we cannot have our workers competing with slave labor in china but in addition to that the immorality of having this slave labor of people who are now in the prison labor camps and the slave labor camps and the reformthroughlabor camps there are people who are there for offenses other than expressing their political and religious views but there are those who are there for that reason so the list goes on and on about how they violate our trade relationship the chinese peoples liberation army and its companies have thriving businesses in the united states the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey talked about the ak47s slightly changed just a little bit to get through customs through some letter that they got from the treasury department and we are writing to secretary bentsen about that and i think he seems willing to review that issue but a million of those ak47 rifles are sold on the streets of our country for 129 that is about onetenth of the cost it would be for a similar weapon it has become the weapon of choice for gangs for drug dealers for you name it we talked about weapons proliferation and we were really talking about nonconventional nuclear chemical and biological weapons but in this case we are talking about arming to the teeth the teenagers of the country it is cheaper to buy one of those than some of the highfalutin sneakers that teenagers like today so we have major problems with how they abuse our good nature that we have given them why again do we have the leverage back at the time of tiananmen square in 1989 they were making 6 billion off of our trade almost 9 billion in 1990 12 billion in 1991 18 billion in 1992 24 billion in 1993 and it will be into the 30 billions this year of profit they make off of our trade they do not like capitalism they abhor democracy but they love money and they need hard currency it is up to nearly 40 percent of the chinese exports which come to the united states they need those exports to fuel their domestic economy growth we have been told by their trade people that they need to increase their exports in order to continue to fuel that growth so they need access to our markets regardless of what their bullying tactics are and their brinksmanship has attempted to put forth why the fuss why have they hired many lawyers in washington dc almost every law firm has some thing going with china why have they hired so many public relations firms over and over when i was in china once the foreign minister said to me we consider mfn your domestic issue were not involved in it i said well thats interesting then why pay over 1 million to a public relations firm to lobby congress to defeat the override of the presidents veto if you consider it such a domestic issue it is not a domestic issue for them it is just not the united states it is a domestic issue for them in their own country sure there are human rights violations all throughout the world but when we have an opportunity to make a real difference in a country about how it treats its people and how it allows freedom of speech and thought and religion et cetera and we do not use that leverage then we lose the moral authority to go out and to say to people you should correct your human rights because what we were saying if we walk away from the situation is we want to promote human rights but we do not want to do it if there is any squawking from the business community and we do not want to do it if the other country objects well i mean we are a very mature democracy we say that promoting human rights and democratic principles is part of our foreign policy and indeed president clinton i am very proud to say has reinforced that message that is why i am so very very proud of secretary christopher he went there to deliver a message he was strong enough to take what was inevitable from the chinese and anybody who has dealt with them a long time knows that this is act one bully act two soften act three let us sit down and talk he had enough selfconfidence and the strength of his commitment to the promotion of human rights throughout the world that he was the person to do the job and i am proud that he did it the third issue that i touched on and it was the issue of proliferation and that the clinton administration has issued sanctions against china for the sale of the missile technology to pakistan giving them the capacity to launch a nuclear weapon it seems ironic that everybody says oh we cannot lift mfn in china or even threaten to because they will not cooperate with our policy as far as north korea is concerned and their developing a weapon well china has no interest in a nuclear korean peninsula they have every interest in it being nonnuclear so south korea decides now that it wants a weapon if north korea does and japan says well i have to have one if they have one so it is in chinas interest to cooperate on north korea but at the same time people are saying we need their help there they are forgetting conveniently that china is part of the problem by proliferating weapons to nonsafeguarded countries weapons that are very serious and which our law requires sanctions for which i am pleased that the clinton administration did of course obviously i could talk all night i have a lot to say about this as do many of our other members and they will be in the nights ahead but i through it was important as our colleagues did that we stand up and say thank you mr christopher for having the courage of your convictions for being willing to come back here and take the attacks of the new china lobby in washington dc including may i say some former secretaries of state who made their reputation and their name as a part of thepublic sector in this country and who are now extensively involved in business deals in china that is their right and i respect their opinion that they hold that they disagree about china mfn but for them to criticize the secretary of state for standing up for american values while making big money and this china thing is very big money now they are personally financially benefiting from it i think it is appalling i think they owe the american people an apology and i think also the press should really point out that while so and so is speaking as a former secretary of state or a former national security adviser he is also intheory doing business deals as wespeak with china and there is a direct conflict of interest as i said they have a right to do business and they have a right to their opinion the public has a right to know what their financial gain is when they speak as a secretary of state and they are privately benefiting from the statements they are making i will end and then we will do this another night and in the morning as well in addition to thanking secretary christopher i want to quote from the new york times editorial this week entitled standing up to china it supported the conditioning of mfn to china and it says to kowtow to chinese bullying would be to repeat the mistakes of the bush administration which squandered american influence by its consistent refusal to press human rights issues the clinton administration needs instead to be forthright about its continued determination to insist on human rights progress china despite its cool indifference desperately needs the over 20 billion hard currency surplus it earns from its trade with the united states to carry on with its ambitious economic development plans the clintou administration has a clear right under international law and an obligation under united states law to link chinas trade status to minimum human rights goals the administration has demanded nothing unreasonable or demeaning for the most part afking only compliance with internstional agreements to which china already subscribes mr speaker with that i yield to the gentleman from new york"],

amendment madam chairman there is another side of this story let me say that we are not here to debate the tremendous job that the helium operation does in my opinion for this country but we are here to debate the cox amendment which is requesting that nasa purchase its helium from the private sector i might add that the helium operation that this country has is a model for an example there was an article that came out in the washington post on june 29 1993 which states that the national helium reserve is a rare good federal program and that the helium field operates well in a general manner and this is a federal program that does work what the gentleman told my colleagues my friend from california is a little misleading back in the 1960s when the federal government purchased the helium they placed that helium in reserves up in amarillo tx and in other areas across the country but during that period of time the bureau of mine set an interest rate that they would pay back to the unitedstates treasury the federal government never appropriated funds to help pay back that interest rate during that period of time interest rates would go up to 18 percent and drop down to some of the lower rates of interest that we are witnessing today well over that period of time madam chairman we have now seen a billion dollars worth of interest that is owed to the federal government it is basically one agency owing another agency interest payments gao studied this problem and their recommendation back to congress was that congress should forgive the billiondollarinterest note if we were able to do that we would see the helium operation in a sense giving back to the federal government anywhere from 10 to 11 million a year in the current program that we now have madam chairman we appropriate about 23 million from the unitedstates treasury to different federal agencies basically through the bureau of mines and that money is then used in different federal agencies of which nasa is a big user of the helium that we produce in this country but we return back to the unitedstates treasury 13 million now the reason that the gentleman from california my friend is supporting us the private sector selling helium to nasa is because he claims that it can be at a cheaper price than what the federal government offers well the reason the federal governments helium prices are higher than the private sector is because president bush chose to raise the price of helium when in all honesty the answer is for the federal g6vernment to lower the price of helium we can indeed sell helium cheaper than the private sector can this is a resource that the taxpayers own we paid 750 million for this resource it is now valued at over a billion dollars but the debate here today is not what to do with the helium reserves madam chairman the debate today is whether or not nasa should purchase our helium from the private sector i might add that the gentleman from californias amendment is in direct conflict with the helium act in itself his amendment really has no impact at all on nasa purchasing their helium from the federal government because his amendment does not address the helium

people desperately deserving in my state of connecticut i oppose gagging the very process on which democracy relies to develop good policy my three amendments do not represent a danger to action they would only have targeted these benefits and funded these benefits we funded the extension of benefits last year we have funded the extension of benefits the year before and if we are serious about deficit reduction we can fund the extension of benefits this year and so my amendments would do three very simple things and they would honor the reform that we adopted last year during the adoption of that reform we said after this reform no state will ever be held back from meeting the needs of their longterm unemployed by the failure of this body to act i respect that thoughtful reform and i honor it here today it is simply and plainly irresponsible to borrow 100 percent of the dollars to fund this bill when we are going to provide benefits to some states where their unemployment is 3 2 percent when unemployment was 4 percent in my district i had businesses closing because they could not find people to hire it is irresponsible to borrow those dollars to fund extended benefits in states below the trigger it is also irresponsible and this is my second amendment not to require those states with surpluses in their funds to use their dollars matched with our dollars to fund these benefits until they need our help it is irresponsible once we have taxed our people to fund needed benefits to then go out and borrow 100 percent to pay for them all over again those are my two amendments what is dangerous about those we cut out the states where there really is not an extended benefit problem and we use those resources that we have already generated by taxing the people to

percent of that surplus to mexico is for factory parts and buildings in other words drills presses and construction material for factories that other 64 percent is for parts that are manufactured here some of them in maquiladoras on the border and brought back here fully 85 percent never touch the mexican consumer markets they never buy it at all basically what we are doing is shipping our factories down there and our jobs are certainly following that another nafta math lesson here is how they compute the fact that we are creating jobs by trade with mexico let me give you a good example smith corona 850 workers in their plant in new york they decided to go to mexico they go down to mexico shut the plant up in new york that plant in new york was also being fed by about 2 000 jobs with smaller suppliers in the new york area now the plant goes down to mexico takes the 850 jobs the way they figure it out with nafta math is not that we lost 850 jobs to mexico but that we gained 2 000 jobs because the suppliers in new york now are supplying mexico it is absolutely crazy and it is fraudulent and deceptive and it is not right it sort of reminds me a little bit of the university of maryland football team the university of maryland football team scored about 24 points a game they may have 450 yards a game you think well that is a pretty impressive record until you understand that they give up 42 points a game and give up 500 yards a game and their record is 1 and 6 or something like that it is the difference between net product and gross product they do not tell you the full
