consensus of the exact cause they did however conclude that the financial crisis was avoidable and was the result of the following factors an explosion in risky subprime lending an unsustainable rise in housing prices widespread reports of egregious and predatory lending practices dramatic increases in household mortgage debt and exponential growth in financial firms trading activities unregulated derivatives and shortterm repo lending markets just among a few of the red flags surely with all those factors chairman bernanke should have been more concerned in fact the title of my speech this morning is even with warning signs bernanke failed to sound the alarm in fact he was warned by members of the federal reserve board often the release of transcripts from the federal open market committee fomc meetings in 2006 shed light on the critical failures of the federal reserve and mr bernanke to act when the warning signs were clear and present the first meeting however was spent praising bernankes predecessor outgoing federal chairman alan greenspan but the fcic later concluded that 30 years of deregulation and reliance on selfregulation by financial institutions that was championed by mr greenspan were the factors in devastating the stability of our nations market stripping away safeguards that simply could have avoided this catastrophe now in a later meeting on may 10 2006 of the fomc then fed governor susan bies was one of the earliest to raise concern over the nations mortgage sector which offered exotic loans that increased household debt over time instead of decreasing it now specifically her concerns stem from the absence of home equity growth and the consumers ability to absorb the uncertainties of the housing market listen to mr bernankes response when she made her declaration so far we are seeing at worst an orderly decline in the housing market but there is still i think a lot to be seen as to whether the housing market will decline slowly or more quickly yet again another colleague then fed vice chairwoman janet yellen warns of the possibility of an unwelcome housing slump but in the meeting of august 8 2006 chairman bernanke remains hopeful in his prediction for a soft landing for our economy need i say the 2008 great recession was not a soft landing in the september meeting the feds still remained oblivious to the detrimental effects in the housing market that will affect the rest of the economy in the last meeting of the fomc fed governor bies again in december 2006 stated once again her concern of the housing market stating that mortgages securitized in the past few years warrants additional risk than the investors have been focusing on despite the concerns that reported increased difficulty getting mortgages in their region as well as a noticeable cool down in housing activity mr bernanke fails to see the warning signs and again predicts a soft landing on december 12 2006 once again this was his second statement of a soft landing in the same year it was the failure of mr bernanke to not pursue possible vulnerabilities and assuring us to the contrary that attributed to the economic crisis that we faced on february 15 2007 he stated overall economic prospects for households remains good the labor market is expected to stay healthy and real incomes should continue to rise the business sector remains in excellent financial condition again on march 28 2007 he stated the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime markets seems likely to be contained even on may 17 2007 despite concerns raised by fed governor bies again he said we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system how wrong he was but all of the dire warning signs were there at bernankes confirmation hearing in the senate banking committee he conceded to the notion that the central bank should have done more thats an understatement

jobs for a very long time democrats are hoping for a vote in the other body on the presidents american jobs act in the last congress although we documented 3 million jobs i can assure you that our stimulus package created millions of jobs unrecorded because it was emergency funding that did not require that recording my amendment speaks to clarity and it is not conflicting with jobs for those of you who are listening to this debate its about the industrial boiler industry they do have jobs and i frankly believe that the regulations that they have lived with do not impair their ability to promote jobs what most people dont know is there is an indefinite language or allows an indefinite time frame for noncompliance theres no time line for the industry to comply with clean air rules impacting our children just like this little one being seen by a nurse suffering from any number of respiratory illnesses so the bill in its current form also gives the epa discretion to go beyond 5 years you know how long that is that may be jobkilling time because when businesses look to move to areas even if theyre older industry they want to know that there is an effort made to create a better quality of life this amendment will help the industry it indicates that the time for compliance is 3 years and yes there may be discretion to expand but 3 years i believe this is a fair approach because in actuality the rule that the epa has passed has resulted in 1 7 million tons of reduction in air pollution per year thats a good thing for job creation and so this amendment is a simple approach to indicating that outdoor air pollution is damaging small particles and ground level ozone come from car exhaust smoke road dust and factory emissions why wouldnt we want to improve the quality of life i can only say to you that out of those polluting elements come chest pain coughing digestive problems dizziness fever sneezing shortness of breath and a number of other ailments so my amendment is a good thing to be able to talk about jobs clarity knowing when you must comply and preventing premature deaths and protecting our children but let me say what else this bill does this bill causes an extra 1 million in new discretionary spending by the epa to comply were supposed to be in a budgettight atmosphere were supposed to be budget cutting but my friends that is not what were doing here so i would simply say that even though my good friend indicates that 200 000 jobs would be saved with this particular bill i dont know where the documentation is but i will assure you that areas where the boiler industry is that have a defined clarity on what the timeframe is for making sure that youre in compliance i can assure you that that creates jobs and that creates a clean atmosphere quality of life and clean air for more industry to come into your states for you to diversify so i ask my colleagues to support a simple amendment that ensures that the compliance is for 3 years clarifying that to the industry giving them a time certain to comply and also giving discretion to the epa to help america grow jobs i hope we all will join in growing jobs in voting for the american jobs act and right now i hope that well vote for the jackson lee amendment that gives clarity in timeframe for compliance and again saves lives like this little ones that we all want to protect with that i yield back the balance of my time and i ask my colleagues to vote for the amendment mr chair i rise today in support of my amendment to h r 2250 the epa regulatory relief act my amendment requires the industrial boiler industry to comply with environmental protection agency epa rules no later than 3 years after the rules have been finalized currently the bill requires the industrial boiler industry to comply with epa rules no earlier than five years after the rules have been finalized the bill also allows indefinite noncompliance there is no deadline set for industry compliance the bill in its current form also gives the epa the discretion to extend the 5 year deadline for compliance the epa would have the authority to extend a three year deadline as well the three year deadline i proposed can be extended by the epa while setting a goal that shows our firm commitment to saving lives i have offered this amendment to ensure that the epa has the ability to reduce toxic emissions from numerous industrial sources including the industrial boiler industry as they are required to do under the clean air act the epa has issued clean air rules targeting 170 different types of facilities which have resulted in a 1 7 million ton reduction in air pollution per year epa rules are now being finalized for both the industrial boiler industry and cement kiln industry and these bills are intended to indefinitely delay compliance with epas maximum achievable control technology mact standards prior to their promulgation as the representative for houston the countrys energy capital i am committed to creating an environment in which the energy industry and regulating agencies can work together for more than 40 years the epa has been charged with protecting our environment there has been a consistent theme of chipping away at the ability of the epa to protect our air we have to consider the long term costs to public health if we fail to establish reasonable measures for clean air outdoor air pollution is caused by small particles and ground level ozone that comes from car exhaust smoke road dust and factory emissions outdoor air quality is also affected by pollen from plants crops and weeds particle pollution can be high any time of year and are higher near busy roads and where people burn wood when we inhale outdoor pollutants and pollen this can aggravate our lungs and can lead us to developing the following conditions chest pain coughing digestive problems dizziness fever lethargy sneezing shortness of breath throat irritation and watery eyes outdoor air pollution and pollen may also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma there are serious costs to our long term health the epa has promulgated rules and the public should be allowed to weigh in to determine if these rules are effective the purpose of having so many checks and balances within the epa is to ensure that the needs of industries and the needs of our communities are addressed providing a time for individuals to support or oppose any regulations is a meaningful first step this bill is a step in the wrong direction the epa has spent years reviewing these standards before attempting to issue regulations the proposed regulations to the industrial boiler industry will significantly reduce mercury and toxic air pollution from power plants and electric utilities the epa estimates that for every year this rule is not implemented mercury and toxic air pollution will have a serious impact on public health think for a moment about the lives that can be saved we are talking about thousands of health complications and deaths what more do we need to know according to the natural resources defense council this rule would prevent the following 9 000 premature deaths 5 500 heart attacks 58 000 asthma attacks 6 000 hospital and emergency room visits 6 000 cases of bronchitis 440 000 missed work days this legislation not only presents a threat to public health it also blatantly violates the cutgo spending provision the epa regulatory relief act requires the epa to select a regulatory option that is least burdensome to the industrial boiler industry regardless of alternate options that may be more feasible or cost effective the congressional budget office cbo estimates that this bill will result in 1 million dollars in new discretionary spending by the epa and the bill does not offset the authorization i understand the economic impacts of regulation but we must also act responsibly we cannot ignore the public health risks of breathing polluted air nor can we pretend that these emissions do not exacerbate global warming alternatively we certainly do not want to hinder job creation and economic growth congress passed the clean air act to allow the epa to ensure that all americans had access to clean air and we must not strip the agency of that right my friends on the other side of the aisle will tell you that this act is going to save more than 200 000 american jobs but what about the lives we will lose we do not want to hinder economic prosperity and robust job creation but let us strive toward an economic climate where jobs can be created by implementing technology to reduce dangerous toxic emissions and protect the american people it does not have to be one way or the other in a country of vast innovation surely we can forge a path forward in which we do not have to choose between creating jobs and saving lives lest we forget since 1999 houston has exchanged titles with los angeles for the poorest air quality in the nation the poor air quality is attributed to the amount of aerosols particles of carbon and sulfates in the air the carcinogens found in the air have been known to cause cancer particularly in children the epa is the very agency charged with issuing regulations that would address this serious problem this bill may very well jeopardize the air that we breathe the water that we drink our public lands and our public health by deep funding cuts in priority initiatives mr chair there are times in which we are 50 individual states and there are times when we exist as a single nation with national need one state did not defend the nation after the attacks on pearl harbor one state on its own did not end segregation and establish civil rights every so often there comes an issue so vital we must unite beyond our districts and beyond our states and act as a nation and protecting the quality of our air is one of those times i encourage my colleagues to support the jackson lee amendment in order to uphold the epas authority to enforce the clean air act by ensuring the industrial boiler industry must comply with finalized epa regulations we are protecting the quality of the air that all of our constituents breathe surely preventing illness and premature death by ensuring every american has access to clean air is not controversial again i urge my colleagues to support my amendment"], [0.9936684966087341, 0.9936684966087341, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume about 2 years ago the gentleman from michigan and i were in kabul and kandahar together on a trip i remember talking to my democratic colleague saying that there must be things that republicans and democrats can work together on to solve we were obviously in a country that was torn apart by differences but we both had something in commonwe were concerned about our constituents we were concerned about unemployment and we were concerned about jobs i think thats true of every member in this body we know that the path to prosperity is jobs and that if americans are working if theyre earning they feel better about themselves and that if theyre losing their jobs then its going to be not only a problem for them and their families but for their communities and for their country i am happy to reportand i think its fitting that the gentleman from michigan would be across the aisle from me managing the time for the minoritythat here we are moving four pieces of legislation today tomorrow and on friday legislation which will create jobs and will do so without government expense in fact theyll do so with some marginal savings to the government but with a great savings to those businesses this morningand i dont know that it was a coincidencethe job figures came out large corporations lost 1 000 employees last month but our middlesized and small businesses created 108 000 jobs now those arent enough jobs those arent enough jobs for the people graduating and going into the workforce but thats where job creation is coming from in the economy nowfrom small and middlesized businesses those with under 500 employees particularly and from that midrange of 50 to 500 employees this bill that the gentleman from connecticut has brought forward has won bipartisan support because it actually will create jobs in those small community banks and credit unions because it will make their cost of capital less in a recent survey 70 percent of small and middlesized businesses those with 500 or fewer employees said if we had more capital if we had more funding we would hire this is 70 percent only 14 percent said they were going to hire the difference in that number is that the others werent sure that they could get capital there are two ways that you obtain capital to create jobs one is you go and borrow it from a bank or from an insurance company in some cases or from someone else but there is another way which is by someone willing to invest in your company as a small boy i can remember my father had a business and before that hed invested with another man in a business i think that one of the american dreams is not only owning a houseand thats still an american dream to own your own home even in the circumstances weve been throughbut either to have your own business or to be able to invest in somebody elses business the gentleman from connecticuts legislation will allow that threshold of people who want to invest in a communitybased financial institution and it will encourage those community banks to allow more shareholders more people to participate yes they will be participating in the risk but theyll also be participating in the profit which is really the american system when you invest you take risks but if things are successful you profit thats where the risks and the profits ought to be taken they shouldnt be taken by the taxpayers involuntarily and they shouldnt be taken by the government the government shouldnt take the taxpayers money and invest in business it is those taxpayersour constituents our citizenswho ought to make the decisions on what companies they want to invest in we all know community banks are struggling today it will allow them to attract investors people who say i want to invest in your bank they may be people who do business with the banks and will probably be people who live in the community this bill will be the first of four bills that we bring forward and they are going to be successful theyre going to move from the house to the senate ill predict this week because as the minority whip the gentleman from maryland said there is agreement that this is the right thing to do and that we do have an obligation not only to oppose some things but to also be for positive legislation the house this week will be for something it will be for job creation it will be for allowing people to invest it will be enabling companies to attract that capital and hire people so we can feel very good about ourselves this week and it can start with this bill this is not a minor piece of legislation but its on suspension because it enjoys widespread support as does the bill tomorrow as for the two in the following days weve worked out the differences the gentleman from colorado had a concern about a bill later this week he felt like it didnt have enough investor protection weve addressed that concern and have added his suggestion to the bill all four of these bills that will move this week are bipartisan bills theyre not republican bills theyre not democratic bills theyre bipartisan bills i commend the minority whip for speaking out for these billsi think that bodes welland i hope the senate was listening i also appreciate the gentleman from connecticut for a bill that really is long overdue it will immediately allow our community banks to invest and not be dependent on the government for help with that i yield back the balance of my time"],

happening and what can we do about it representative tom rooney from florida and i introduced the bipartisan preserving access to lifesaving medications act which eventually had 85 cosponsors the bill creates an early warning system between the fda drug companies and providers so a community can respond to a drug shortage quickly and efficiently it wont solve the root problems of the drug shortage crisis but it will help providers and doctors and hospitals identify those crises and help with the patient this february for example under a voluntary program the fda stepped in to allow for temporary emergency importation of the cancer drug doxil which was in shortage and at the same time the fda prioritized the review of a new manufacturer of the same drug when the cancer drug went into shortage so what our bill will do is make this program mandatory what we think it will do is it will help patients across the spectrum get the drugs they need it will help the hospitals and the providers identify potential shortages and it will help the manufacturers better make sure that they get the drugs to the patients that need them im thrilled that this is contained and i want to thank
