advise members that in 1969 some military bases were closed in fact i recall when i first arrived as a newly elected member of congress the secretary of defense recommended that a naval training

satellites and the judiciarys uncontrollable cost increases and drug case workload for the frozen programs the result is that the operating levels will suffer an inflationdriven cut there are other increases in this billfor the programs of the state department and agencies and commissions operating in the international affairs arena under the november 1987 economic summit agreement reached by the president and the bipartisan congressional leadership these programs enjoy a special protection status this bill is in compliance with the budget authority and outlay allocations to the subcommittee the bottom line is 248 million below the presidents requests frankly none of us are satisfied with this bill but in view of the conditions under which we have had to work it is the best one we could bring to you there are a number of reasons for our dissatisfaction first many of the programs which should be covered under this bill are not funded in it there is no authorization for them what the committee has done is reserve freezelevel budget authority and outlays within our budget allocation for these programs the amount reserved constitutes about 46 percent of the dollars available to our subcommittee programs affected due to lack of authorization range from the such discretionary defense function programs as the federal bureau of investigations dedicated project fund and the ready reserve force in the maritime administration through such discretionary domestic function programs as most of the justice department activities the economic development administration the patent and trademark office the federal trade commission and the office of the unitedstates trade representative second the bipartisan economic summit agreement reached in the negotiations between the president and the congressional leadership last november failed to provide for adequate funding of vitally and urgently needed domestic programs such as those which help generate job opportunities for american workers protect the international trade interests of workers farmers business and industry third the terms and conditions imposed by the fiscal 1989 budget resolution severely restrain the options available to the congress for responding to important domestic needs which could have and should have been dealt with in this bill all three of these problems are the result of factors beyond the jurisdiction of our subcommittee and our committee nevertheless tbhe bill which we bring for your consideration today is a good bill it is worthy of your support i urge that the house vote to pass this bill i would like to compliment the chairman of the subcommittee on appropriations for state justice he has set some sort of record this year by coming back to attend to the business of

the lowest costs possible like it or not in my opinion there was a deal made several years ago that we would deploy the mx in silos while a mobile basing system was developed at the same time as the gentleman said we would begin work on developing a small icbm the midgetman well now that a mobile basing mode for the peacekeeper has been identified some members want to kill it i find it ironic that those same individuals who opposed the mx because it was in the siloscalling it sitting ducknow oppose the rail garrison mode i would argue that we cannot have it both ways if the mx is not survivable in fixed silosand some say that it is notthen we should continue with the agreement that we made in the 98th congress and the 99th congress and that was to develop a survivable mobile base system we have that system before us today we are going to hear arguments oh no dont base the mx in a rail garrison mode because it will be destabilizing i would argue that if 50 mobile mx missiles are going to be destabilizing then what will the 500 planned midgetman missiles be i think that we are going to bear about cost rail garrison will be too expensive i would say that a mobile basing system would require a lot less moneysignificantly less moneythan the midgetman itself if we continue with the midgetman production we will spend somewhere around 42 billion i believe that we need to make a choice and i have said repeatedly that we should not continue to try two missile systems i am prepared to support not only the gentleman from alabama and the gentleman from arizona but i would even support the gentleman from california who proposes scrapping the midgetman missile altogether saving some 2 billion in the first year i would merely argue that we need to put a plan together and

bill to allow members of the armed forces to sue the united states for damages for personal injury or death caused by negligent medical care first i would like to compliment our colleague congressman barney frank the sponsor of this measure and the distinguished chairman of the judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and governmental relations congressman frank is to be commended for his insisting on improvements in the medical care furnished to activeduty military personnel and for his seeking the right for our soldiers sailors airmen and marines to sue for compensation under the federal tort claims act it is a travesty that the brave men and women who proudly and courageously wear our countrys uniform have too frequently fallen not from hostile fire but because of medical incompetence medical malpractice in general is a serious problem it is particularly tragic when activeduty military personnel are denied the right to sue under the federal tort claims act and the supreme courts fares doctrine for damages for personal injury or death resulting from negligent medical or dental care in military facilities one of my constituents maj david brown of seabrook md served two tours in vietnam during the course of a 14year career in the unitedstates army major brown received the bronze star and the purple heart as well as a number of combat citations and glowing recommendations unfortunately major browns bright and promising military career ended early he did not suffer injuries in any enemy ambush or a firefight instead major brown entered the womack army hospital at fort bragg nc in may 1980 for elective surgery to correct a fertility problem during this surgery major brown experienced a drop in blood pressure leading to depressed breathing and a severely diminished oxygen intake major brown suffered permanent brain damage and other mental and physical disabilities what was once a promising and successful military career ended when the army transferred major brown to the walter reed army medical center the army found him unfit for further military service and involuntarily retired major brown with a 100percent disability rating major brown cannot sue the federal government for compensation for his injuryan injury directly attributable to medical malpractice this legislation does not help major brown because h r 1054 would be effective upon enactment not retroactively however i join with congressman frank and the other proponents of this legislation in hoping for an immediate improvement in the quality of the care and treatment provided to activeduty military personnel it is too late for h r 1054 to help major brown it is also too late for this measure to help the many other activeduty military personnel who have been injured or killed as a result of medical malpractice but it is not too late to help those who currently serve in the military or those who will on day defend their country by passing h r 1054 the

comprehensive effort to restore some real efficiency and imagination to the federal government in 1954 we created the government employees incentive awards act what that program did was to establish funds for awarding public employees who develop good ideas that can help make the federal government work more efficiently and more effectively since that time we have asked for a review by the gao to determine how this program has been utilized and in some areas of the federal government it has worked very well but i must tell you that those areas of the federal government where it works well is very few and far between in fact it is estimated by the gao that in fiscal year 1985 32 government entities had no program whatsoever in terms of the federal maritime administration and the federal maritime commission in 1984 they received 3 suggestions total out of 233 people in that agency two of them were adopted and they have estimated that they have received no benefit from the adoption of those two suggestions in 1985 and 1986 there were no suggestions made by the employees of the federal maritime commission in the federal maritime administration in 1984 there was one suggestion that was made by an employee within the federal maritime administration in 1985 there was one and in 1986 there were two the number proposed per 100 is so miniscule it does not even really merit mentioning however within the department of the air force within the pentagon of all places where we wonder about getting employees suggestions used in order to better the operation of government there were 16 4 suggestions per 100 there were 8 974 suggestions adopted at an estimated savings of 71 million the state department in contrast received 0 13 suggestions per 100 employees during that same year adopted 1 and reported no measurable benefits as i already pointed out 32 government entities have no program whatsoever now when you take a look at how effective this thing has been we found that in fiscal year 1985 39 agencies reported firstyear measurable benefits from their suggestion programs totaling 209 million that is almost a quarter of a billion dollars that has been saved by giving employees incentives and rewards for coming up with unique ideas a may 1986 report by the merit system of the protection board found that we are not only going to save money but there are an awful lot of intangible benefits from this program like enhanced employee morale what the amendment does is it is an attempt to force the entities of government the departments agencies the bureaus commissions to actually report to the office of management and budget on the status of these programs how many awards they have given out if they have given no awards out why they have not given any out what they are doing to try to enhance their programs what they are trying to do to overcome laws or statutes or regulations that may get in the way of the program that rewards good work by federal employees i think it makes sense that we lock this into every federal entity that is out there the idea of suggestions the idea of performance awards is another area where we need to look and we will have more to say on that later"]]}
