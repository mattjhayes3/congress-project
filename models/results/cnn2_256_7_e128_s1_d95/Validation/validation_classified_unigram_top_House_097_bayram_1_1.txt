economic prospects that we now have tremendous amounts of excess idle capacity in our factories and the threats of new waves of bankruptcies among our businesses the people of the united states now want their chance at a meaningful tax relief package a vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that chance under the congressional black caucus proposal your middle income constituents will fare far better in tax relief than under the kemprothreagan second and third year tax measures under our tax proposal the 96 percent of the people of this country who make 50 000 a year or less will have much more money in their pockets and in their pocketbooks gone in our proposal are last years windfall profits tax exemptions of 1 billion gone are the tax loopholes that gave excessive benefits to oil companies and to people who invested only in chinese and antiques and gold coins those features of the fauntroy substitute measured alone save us 10 billion in deficit spending a vote for the congressional black caucus is a vote to reduce taxes for 96 percent of the people of this country this is the peoples house and we ask you to give them a chance to receive what they want and what they need meaningful real tax relief the people of this country want relief from the enormous budget deficit that has resulted from last years tax giveaway to the rich and the gigantic increase in military spending of last year the people o this country now know that those large deficits mean continued high interest rates and thus continued small business and small farmer failures and continued high unemployment at record levels such as we have achieved in this past year the people of this countryand remember this is the peoples housewant a strong national defense but they do not want domination of the world they want an end to nuclear proliferation and your vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that they know with former secretary of the defense ielvin laird thatand i quote him our true strategic military needs have little to do with military weapons except to deter their use against us he points out that we must be able to keep open the sea and air links that bind us to our allies and that we need to be able to hold ground on the borders of europe and elsewhere and to protect and sustain power at great distance none of these objectives as i continue to quote former secretary of defense melvin laird none of these objectives requires nuclear weapons your vote for the fauntroy substitute will acknowledge that fact ii12689 the caucus budget also anwers a number of concerns raised by amendments offered for consideration under the rule today for those of you who have offered amendments to raise the cola caps in the jones budget for federal employees and retirees and to all of my colleagues who intend to support those amendments i say that a vote for the caucus amendment does just what you want the fauntroy substitute does not require such amendments since it incorporates the cbo baseline levels which preserve current service costofliving adjustments for federal pay and pensions a number of members have offered amendments to increase funding for function 500 education above the level recommended by the house budget committee the fauntroy substitute also as proposed raises funding for education above the house budget committee level and indeed it includes funding to restore programs to the present fiscal year 1982 reductions as passed in grammlatta let me now briefly outline the details of the congressional black caucus substitute before concluding my remarks you first ought to understand that the cbc budget reduces the deficit substantially in fact the congressional budget office has estimated that our budget will produce a 92 8 billion deficit in fiscal year 1983 which is lower by at least 10 billion than the deficit estimated by cbo for any other substitute and half the 183 billion deficit that will exist if nothing is done to rectify the errors of last years budget moreover our budget will lead to steadily shrinking deficits of 60 billion in fiscal year 1984 and a 18 billion surplus in fiscal year 1985 bringing interest rates down and providing the basis for genuine economic recovery in our country second you ought to know that the fauntroy substitute is fair and humane we not only prevent that many additional cuts in human needs programs as proposed by the president we return funds to social programs that were lost by the enactment of the reagan fiscal year 1982 budget reductions these programs must remain federal priorities if we value human potential and care to meet human needs because of savings generated by our alternative tax and defense policies several education health housing and urban programs can be restored to fiscal year 1981 funding levels adjusted for inflation for example the fauntroy substitute adds 3 3 billion to title i 600 million to pell grants for disadvantaged college students increasing funding for health care programs it adds 600 million in social services funding including child welfare programs and 1 billion more tlan reagan for pollution control it retains eda and the legal services corporation and lowincome energy and other conservation programs the third thing that this budget does is that it stimulates and creates jobs a centerpiece of our budget proposal is the creation of a major 6 billion to 8 billion federal jobs vocational education and training package this is a response to both the nations unemployment rate generally and to the catastrophic unempioyment in the black community specifically the fauntroy substitute also includes a 4 billion urban infrastructure proposal which will create 50 000 to 80 000 jobs directly and more indirectly a 4 billion expansion in mass transit and highway construction programs which will create an equal number of jobs in this country it also includes home ownership assistance and rental housing construction programs that will stimulate employment in residential construction finally the budget insures adequate social security and other support for the nations poor both the elderly and the nonelderly this budget maintains the costofliving adjustment for elderly on fixed incomes and expands unemployment compensation benefits at a time when we have 10 3 million people out of work the program triggers in the caucus budget increase eligibility for the unemployed to 52 weeks in our view this restoration of benefits is necessary at a time when we are experiencing the levels of unemployment which have not been endured since the depression our budget also provides increased funding for other programs to assist the poor including 3 2 billion more than reagan for aid to families with dependent children 5 billion more for food stamps 3 billion more for medicaid and medicare 1 2 billion more for six health programs and 400 million more for supplemental social insurance as my colleagues in the congressional black caucus follow me they will give you more details about the caucus budget resolution i simply want to remind you again that this is the peoples house and we ought to give the people the life support programs that will cushion them through these difficult times we need to give 96 percent of the people of this country the kird of tax relief that we have pr45mised in the generalized language about tax relief for all of the people we need to give the people relief from the enormous deficits and the high interest rates that have robbed the people of this country of homes and farms small businesses and 2 5 million jobs just since july of last year a vote for the fauntroy substitute the economic recovery program of the congressional black caucus will do just that at this time i would like to add the congressional budget offices reestimate of our budget proposal and yield time to my distinguished colleague from new york the third ranking

because of income race or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better during this decade"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9992544054985046, 0.9992544054985046, 0, "mr speaker as chairman of the greater

for the iydp and the federal interagency committee i am a cosponsor of house concurrent resolution 55 the united nations has declared 1981 as the international year of disabled persons to promote the full participation in the life of our society of americas citizens with physical or mental disabilities in recognition of this challenge a group of concerned citizens formed the unitedstates council for the iydp the council a nonprofit organization located in the nations capital has developed national leadership by forming a board of directors of disabled and nondisabled representatives of the coroporate community and of public interest groups the board is chaired by david t kearns president of xerox corp the federal interagency committee the second organization involved in coordinating the international year of disabled persons was established by the direction of the white house domestic policy staff to coordinate unitedstates policies to maximize cooperation and minimize overlap in federal programs it seeks to promote awareness of the needs of disabled in identifying and developing all federal programs the council and the interagency committee hope to build on the progress that has already been made toward establishing americas leadership as a defender of human and civil rights and as a nation advanced in biomedical research accident and disease prevention and technologicial application during the 1970s disabled americans began to see physical barriers come down ramps and curb cuts are more common now transportation systems adapted for persons with disabilities are providing increased mobility and independence education and employment opportunities are expanding for both the physically and mentally handicapped medical and technological breakthroughs and improving the human condition the 1970s was a beginning that is by no means complete much more needs to be done we must each do our part to help bring the remaining barriers down i have hired two disabled persons in my washington officeone who is confined to a wheelchair from a sporting accident and one who lost a limb in the vietnam war for anyone who knows the crowded conditions that capitol hill staff serve under they know that there is not much room for those of us who can walk normally to maneuver and certainly much less for a person in a wheelchair there were some skeptics among my staff members who were not sure that it would be possible to accommodate disabled persons under those circumstances there were others however including me who felt that it was all simply a matter of attitudeif you want it done you do it the first barrier that we had to overcome was to find handicapped housinghousing that is accessible to a wheelchair i must say that i have been disappointed to find such a lack of handicapped housing in the nations capital in fact the young man who is confined to a wheelchair has been forced to begin work later than he wanted because it took him so long to find handicapped housing the second barrier we had to overcome was finding appropriate office furniture that would accommodate a wheelchair property supply said that they had no desks for a handicapped person we have also worked that out i must admit however that it has been the drive and perseverence of the young staffer who is disabled more than anything else that has enabled him to come work for me it is a shame that society as a whole has not done more to make way for disabled persons but at least progress is being made the second young man i have hired to coordinate my activities as chairman of the greater lansing council for the iydp is a vietnam veteran who lost his leg in the vietnam war i serve on the house veterans committee and i have worked closely with the disabled american veterans of america and the paralyzed veterans of america the veterarrs affairs committee daily addresses the needs of thousands of disabled veterans as a member of the subcommittee on hospitals and health care of the house veterans affairs committee i have asked for oversight hearings on prosthetic and spinal cord research congressman ron mottl chairman of the subcommittee has enthusiastical ly agreed to hold those hearings which will take piace sometime in november of this year on april 24 and 25 the planners of the iydp in the state of michigan are holding a conference i will be attending that meeting and chairing a meet ing of all handicapped groups in the greater lansing area to map out plans for our local promotion of the iydp i believe that each of us can do something to promote access for disabled persons to mainstream them into society but perhaps the most important contribution we can each make is to look at our own attitude toward disabled persons in our community at home or at work for ultimately the best any one of us can do and the most a disabled persons asks from us is to be treated as an equal fittingly the iydp logo represents two people in a position of equality joining hands in solidarity and support of each other this is what we hope to accomplish during this year of special recognition for disabled persons and we believe that the

result of requests from the american war refugee board and a representative of the world jewish council his mission was to assist jews to escape from the wholesale slaughter being conducted by adolph hitler his mission and the activities he carried out were both daring and successful the swedish raoul wallenberg association has attributed wallenbergs work to directly saving 20 000 hungarian jews in addition he assisted with the collaboration of others in aiding approximately 100 000 jews to escape unfortunately mr wallenberg would never see the success of his work he would never see the children he helped escape grow to adulthood and he would never receive the thanks of a grateful world unfortunately the yoke of oppression that mr wallenberg helped to lift frcm the hungarian people was only fated to be replaced by another form of oppression mr wallenbergs biography reads like a greek tragedy it is a mixture of triumph and tragedy when soviet forces eventually ended the nazi occupation of hungary in january 1944 one of the first actions they took was to arrest wallenberg for suspicion of spying the charges were unfounded and the act unpardonable instead of being hailed as a hero wallenberg was carted off as a common criminal today a mystery surrounds the fate of raoul wallenberg since his incarceration by the soviets 36 years ago after repeated inquires as to his fate the soviets issued a statement claiming mr wallenberg died of a heart attack in 1974 however former prisoners in the soviet gulag system have claimed to have seen a man resembling mr wallenberg during their confinement in 1975 a russian jew jan kaplan met a swede in the butyrka prison who had been imprisoned for 30 years but still seemed healthy if this man is raoul wallenberg then the soviets are once again heinously guilty of repression and the denial of human rights why will the soviets not reveal the real truth about raoul wallenberg how much longer must we accept the lies and falsehoods offered to us by them hopefully the actions we are taking today as representatives of the people of the united states will help clear up the mystery of raoul wallenberg if he is alive after all these years of unnecessary penal servitude then grant him his freedom so that he can live out the remainder of his years with dignity if he is dead then perhaps the knowledge of his fate will permit his

for 3 years because the house and senate could not agree on legislative review provisions indeed the house defeated two ftc conference reports in 1978 because they did not include an acceptable

measure had been diluted after years of usedcar industry lobbying the final proposal merely required that the dealer provide the consumer with an accurate statement of warranty coverage if any and whether there were any known defects however the industry lobbyists determined that not even these limited facts should be required to be given to used car buyers and through the procedures designed to prevent bureaucratic excesses lobbied to have the used car regulation vetoed the sorry spectacle of congress rushing to defend the used car dealer from the onerous standard of being truthful with consumers on whether there was a warranty on the car and what kind and whether the car had any known defects needs no further elaboration we are seriously deluding ourselves if we believe that the legislative veto provides a reasoned fair examination of the issues as the used car matter amply demonstrates it does not our limited experience with the legislative veto clearly does not provide a basis for making this temporary provision a permanent part of the ftc act indeed if anything our experience fully supports the amendment of the gentleman from massachusetts to strike this prevision i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment e"], [0.0012247562408447266, 0.5012247562408447, 1, "i rise to oppose the frank amendment to the food and agriculture act of 1981 h r 3603 this amendment which is based on the reagan administrations proposal would lower the parity floor on dairy price supports from 75 to 70 percent of parity it would give the secretary of agriculture authority to allow the parity level to drop below 70 percent when government expenditures exceed 750 million finally it would eliminate the semiannual adjustment in the support price while retaining the current dollar level of the support price at 13 10 per hundredweight proponents of this measure argue that price supports must be held down in order to reduce dairy surpluses and cut government spending the president feels that it is fair to ask dairy farmersto make this sacrifice for the sake of the national economy furthermore he and agriculture secretary block claim their proposal preserves an adequate price support program for dairy producers i disagree with the president and his supporters on every point their proposal will not result in an adequate program on the contrary it will drive many farm families out of business their proposal is not the only nor it is the best way to reduce dairy surpluses the administration has badly mismanaged dairy exports has failed to actresponsibly on limiting imports and has cut back on important domestic nutrition programs which utilize milk and milk products finally the amendment is unfair after having provided huge tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in this country how can this administration and this congress blame farm families for rising budget def icits before addressing each of these points in more detail i would like to review some of the history behind this issue four years ago the congress placed a temporary 80 percent of parity floor on milk price supports this relatively highparity floor was enacted to return stability to the dairy market previous lower support levels had resulted in extreme fluctuations in supply and price which hurt both producers and consumers the 80percent floor along with the semiannual adjustment of the support price worked remarkably well during the first 2 years the support price was generally even with or below the market price and the program acquired a relatively small quantity of dairy productsjust slightly above that required for domestic and foreign nutrition programs in 1979 congress reaffirmed the 80percent floor then a severe recession overtook farming in 1980 net farm income dropped 25 percent and this year is expected to rise only to 1979 levels return on investment for farmers in 1980 averaged 2 4 percent this problem was compounded by the restrictions placed on grain exports to the soviet union which helped keep grain prices low dairy farmers did have an adequate pricesupport program this had the unfortunate consequence however of encouraging farmers to switch their resources from other commodities to milk production and encouraging dairy farmers to expand their herds against this background it is not difficult to understand how we arrived at our current situation of course we have a surplus of dairy products when milk is virtually the only major commodity that yields farmers even a marginal profit we can expect farmers to produce a lot of milk unfortunately the administrations solution is to eliminate the profit in dairy farming rather than looking for ways to make other commodities more profitable however it is not accurate to portray dairy farmers as growing rich at the expense of consumers and taxpayers i represent one of the largest dairy districts in the country and i know that this is simply not the case again if we look at recent history we find that dairy farmers work long hours for low wages and their income has not kept pace with increases in the costs of production we also find that dairy products are among the best values available to todays consumers dairy farmers must make huge investments in land buildings equipment and livestock they must be on the job every day of the year their days are long and their work requires much knowledge and skill what do they earn for this effort in 1980 with price supports at 80 percent of parity dairy farmer income averaged 2 89 per hour according to university of wisconsin researchers that is 15 percent below the minimum wage unfortunately that 2 89 will look awfully good if this amendment passes farmers already gave up last aprils adjustment of the support price and it has fallen from 80 t~o 72 percent of parity now the gentleman from massachusetts offers the white house amendment which will give the secretary authority to hold the support price steady for the foreseeable futureat least the next fewv years some argue that because the dollar level of price supports cannot go below 13 10 we are not really cutting price supports this is true if production costs remain constant but as every farmer and businessman knows that day is far off last year dairy production costs rose 10 3 rcent meanwhile the prices received by farmers rose only 7 1 percent undcr this amendment those prices would hardly rise at all for consumers duiry prices have not increased as rapidly as other prices from march 1980 to march 1981 general consumer prices rose 10 6 percent while dairy prices rose only 10 1 percent and as i said the prices received by farmers rose only about 7 1 percent of greater significance is the fact that milk prices have declined in relation to the general wage rate the minutes of work required to purchase a gallon of milk have declined 44 percent over the past three decades the period during which price supports have been kept a 75 percent of parity or more so we can see that the american dairy farmer is not getting rich at the expense of the taxpayer and consumer on the contrary with limited government help he has kept his head above water by working long hours and improving productivity as i stated earlier the points raised in support of the gentlemans amendment are open to question for example the administration and the gentleman from massachusetts claim they are proposing an adequate program i disagree this amendment will cost dairy farmers over 1 billion annually when compared to the 75percent floor proposed by the house agriculture committee make no mistake about it we will be driving family farms out of business with this amendment large operators may be able to weather these losses but a great many small family farms will not the administration tells us this is the only way to lower dairy surpluses meanwhile the white house has stalled on imposing import controls on casein which displaced 333 million pounds of domestic nonfat dry milk in 1980 the administration has also cut important domestic nutrition programs which utilize dairy products and most disturbing is the fact the the president has given a foreign country new zealand veto power over further sales of government butter stocks overseas in each instance the administration has rejected other options for disposing of our surpluses finally there is a question of equity i certainly agree that the 1 886 billion the commodity credit corporation will spend this year on the dairy program is a lot of money but so is the 6 billion in tax breaks this congress gave to those earning over 100 000 in 1982 the same could be said for the 12 billion tax breaks given to the oil industry and the 25 billion given to big business by fiscal mr chairmar we must balance the budget but why are we putting farm families out of business re the same wve are giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our society the american dairy farmers had already accepteid a cut in price supports from 80 to 75 percent of parity the gentlemans amendment will for all practical purposes eliminate the parity floor on the support price i hope that my colleagues will reject the amendment and give the family farm a chance to survive"], [0.0016935467720031738, 0.5016935467720032,

sophisticated offensive weaponry to saudi arabia i am concerned on more than one level first i am concerned because the administrations action is a reversal of unitedstates policy as stated when we first sold the f15 fighter bomber to saudi arabia at that time the carter administration in consultation with the congress determined that the f15s would not be outfitted then or in the future with the sophisticated offensive tools which the reagan administration now seeks to provide it would appear to me that the proposal to sell advanced missiles bomb racks an aerial refueling capacity and the airborne warning and control systems awacs completely reverses the established policies reached 3 years ago such a reversal might very well prove detrimental to the security of the state of israel but to the general stability of the entire middle east second i am concerned because i fear that this proposal is born from the regrettable tendency on the part of the new administration to view foreign policy issues within the context of the eastwest conflict the end result is that we are pouring more and more cargoes of sophisticated weapons into this and other regions of the world at a time when international rhetoric is becoming increasingly strident and when such arms can be seen as only a challenge to peace third i am concerned because although i recognize the administrations claim that this upgrading of the f15s is necessary to maintain the friendship of saudi arabia we have yet to secure an adequate answer from the administration as to what we are getting in returi 1ir this sale are we getting a huge reduction in the price we pay for foreign oil are we getting assistance for unitedstates peace efforts in the middle east are we getting assistance in combatting international terrorism are we getting an end to the call for a royal war or jihad against the nation of israel no i fear that at this time we are getting none of these and i would suggest to the administration that friendship is a twoway street it is based on some sort of mutuality which we must continue to build between our two governments and people whatever the immediate benefits might be in terms of improved relations with saudi arabia they will be no bargain for the united states unless we get some positive answers to these questions and certainly they will be no bargain if such alleged benefits
