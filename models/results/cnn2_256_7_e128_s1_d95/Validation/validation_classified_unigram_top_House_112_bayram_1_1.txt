richest 2 percent of americans while the average american will be lucky to get about one100th or maybe two100ths of that can anyone in this chamber blame the middle class for thinking the system is rigged against them we all admire financial success but when we give away trillions in tax cuts that we cannot afford to those who need them the least its the middle class who has to make up the difference to pay for these tax cuts our republican colleagues have voted to end medicare and would force seniors to pay 6 400 more for their own care on top of that republicans propose changing social security slashing its budget by over 800 million its an ideological agenda that chooses millionaires over the middle class regular folks pay more so that folks like donald trump and mitt romney

mentality and the time to rein in our deficit spending is now families sit down and make budgetsthen they spend within their means it is imperative now more than ever that congress abide by those same principles instead of applying for new credit cards we need to cut up the ones we already have i have long argued that our spending practices in washington are unsustainable and have routinely voted against spending measures in democratic and republicanled congresses that have contributed to the crisis we face today since republicans retook control of the house in january we have changed the discussion in washington from how much more are we going to spend to how much are we going to cut there are some who feel that our problem is not our spending rather it is we are not bringing in enough revenue i find this thought process misguided it is not viable to increase taxes drastically enough to bridge the 1 58 trillion gap between our spending and revenues without destroying jobs and damaging our already struggling economy the cut cap and balance act is a plan to bring longterm change to the washington spending machine first this legislation would cut spending by 111 billion in fiscal year 2012 reducing nondefense discretionary spending below 2008 levels which was called for in the housepassed budget plan second this legislation would place a cap on total spending as a share of gdp without caps on spending future congresses will ultimately resort back to the spending practices that have led to the situation we are currently facing third this legislation will only provide for an increase in the debt limit if congress sends a balanced budget constitutional amendment to the states for ratification a balanced budget amendment to the constitution would legally force our government to live within its means its interesting to see that while many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle including our president have argued that a constitutional amendment is not necessary 49 states currently abide by some form of a balanced budget requirement we cannot pass the financial burdens of our country on to our children and grandchildren it is important to note that while i am not proud of the spending habits of republicans when we were in charge the unprecedented spending increase since 2009 when president obama took office needs to be noted under his leadership our national debt has increased by 3 7 trillion once again that is 3 7 trillion in only two and a half years it took the unitedstates from 1776 until 1992 to accumulate the same amount of debt that president obama accumulated in two and a half years given our fiscal challenges that lay ahead the time to act is now the cut cap and balance act is an important step to bring fiscal sanity back to

that is to have a centralized governmentrun health care system thats the pattern of their future at this moment great britain which had such a thing in place for some time is attempting to back off of their system and have more relationships between physicians and their patients indeed they are doing that because their system does not work its very important that we not allow the former majority to

required to vote up or down on the commissions recommendations my colleague and good friend jim cooper of tennessee joined me in sponsoring this legislation in 2007 and in subsequent years it ultimately became the blueprint for the presidents national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform more commonly referred to as the simpsonbowles commission the simpsonbowles commission produced a credible plan that gained the support of a bipartisan majority of the commissions 18 members called the moment of truth the commissions report made clear that eliminating the debt and deficit will not be easy and that any reform must begin with entitlements mandatory and discretionary spending also has to be addressed as well other sacred cows including tax reform and defense spending had just three more members of the simpsonbowles commission supported the recommendations this plan likely would have passed the congress and be law today i was disappointed that the president and his administration walked away from the commission the president failed the country leadership on both sides of the congressional aisle has done no better this town is dysfunctional if the plan had advanced we would already be on our way in getting our nations fiscal house in order over the past year and a half i have repeatedly said that while there are some changes i would make i would support a budget proposal similar to or based on simpsonbowles if it came to a vote on the house floor i want to commend mr cooper and mr latourete today for offering this substitute amendment which was drafted using the bipartisan principals of the simpsonbowles commission simpsonbowles provides the framework for the most comprehensive and realistic solution to our nations fiscal problems

president know the dire economic situation facing our country a debt load over 15 5 trillion annual deficits over 1 trillion and unfunded obligations and liabilities over 65 trillion on the books to pay for programs such as social security medicare and medicaid were borrowing this money from nations such as chinawhich is spying on us where human rights are an afterthought and catholic bishops protestant ministers and tibetan monks are jailed for practicing their faithand oilexporting countries such as saudi arabiawhich funded the radical madrasahs on the afghanpakistan border resulting in

ferguson testified before my subcommittee and said that if we do not change course the debt burden will not only crush our children and grandchildren but also the current generation in the very near futu re according to the congressional budget offices long term estimate every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025 every penny that means no money for national defense no money for homeland security no money to fix the nations crumbling bridges and roads no money for medical research to find a cure for cancer or alzheimers or parkinsons diseases we have to find a solution to this debt crisis failure is not an option congress and the president must be willing to support a plan that breaks loose from the special interests holding washington by the throat and return confidence to the country congress and the president also need to be honest with the american people and explain that we cannot solve our nations financial crisis by just cutting waste fraud and abuse within discretionary accounts the real runaway spending is occurring in our outofcontrol entitlement costs and the hundreds of billions in annual tax earmarks until we reach an agreement that addresses these two drivers of our deficit and debts we cannot right our fiscal ship of state i amand have beenwilling to make the hard choices to ensure a better future for our children and grandchildren every two years i take an oath to support and defend the constitution i do not sign pledges to lobbyists or special interest groups if the cooperlatourette substitute does not pass today i will vote to support the ryan budget proposal so that we may move the budget process forward and continue the necessary discussions to address our nations financial crisis but i hope this substitute passes it is a balanced and ambitious roadmap to address our deficit it also is the only truly bipartisan plan that is being offered and i believe the only plan that has the opportunity to be approved by the senate more important this proposal calls for difficult decisions by finding savings to completely turn off the budget control acts looming sequestration which could devastate our defense capabilities as i mentioned earlier i do not agree with every recommendation in the simpsonbowles plan nor do i support every part of the cooperlatourette substitute for example i fully support efforts to repeal and replace the patient protection and affordable care act and regret that cooperlatourette is silent on the need to address this issue i am also

should support this substitute preamble throughout our nations history americans have found the courage to do right by our childrens future deep down every american knows we face a moment of truth once again we cannot play games or put off hard choices any longer without regard to party we have a patriotic duty to keep the promise of america to give our children and grandchildren a better life our challenge is clear and inescapable america cannot be great if we go broke our businesses will not be able to grow and create jobs and our workers will not be able to compete successfully for the jobs of the future without a plan to get this crushing debt burden off our backs ever since the economic downturn families across the country have huddled around kitchen tables making tough choices about what they hold most dear and what they can learn to live without they expect and deserve their leaders to do the same the american people are counting on us to put politics aside pull together not pull apart and agree on a plan to live within our means and make america strong for the long haul as members of the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform we spent the past eight months studying the same cold hard facts together we have reached these unavoidable conclusions the problem is real the solution will be painful there is no easy way out everything must be on the table and washington must lead we come from different backgrounds represent different regions and belong to different parties but we share a common belief that americas longterm fiscal gap is unsustainable and if left unchecked will see our children and grandchildren living in a poorer weaker nation in the words of senator tom coburn we keep kicking the can down the road and splashing the soup all over our grandchildren every modest sacrifice we refuse to make today only forces far greater sacrifices of hope and opportunity upon the next generation over the course of our deliberations the urgency of our mission has become all the more apparent the contagion of debt that began in greece and continues to sweep through europe shows us clearly that no economy will be immune if the unitedstates does not put its house in order the reckoning will be sure and the devastation severe the president and the leaders of both parties in both chambers of congress asked us to address the nations fiscal challenges in this decade and beyond we have worked to offer an aggressive fair balanced and bipartisan proposal a proposal as serious as the problems we face none of us likes every element of our plan and each of us had to tolerate provisions we previously or presently oppose in order to reach a principled compromise we were willing to put our differences aside to forge a plan because our nation will certainly be lost without one we do not pretend to have all the answers we offer our plan as the starting point for a serious national conversation in which every citizen has an interest and all should have a say our leaders have a responsibility to level with americans about the choices we face and to enlist the ingenuity and determination of the american people in rising to the challenge we believe neither party can fix this problem on its own and both parties have a responsibility to do their part the american people are a long way ahead of the political system in recognizing that now is the time to act we believe that far from penalizing their leaders for making the tough choices americans will punish politicians for backing down and well they should in the weeks and months to come countless advocacy groups and special interests will try mightily through expensive dramatic and heartwrenching media assaults to exempt themselves from shared sacrifice and common purpose the national interest not special interests must prevail we urge leaders and citizens with principled concerns about any of our recommendations to follow what we call the becerra rule dont shoot down an idea without offering a better idea in its place after all the talk about debt and deficits it is long past time for americas leaders to put up or shut up the era of debt denial is

i grew up thinking that i could do anything that the boys could do and that way of thinking has certainly stayed with me over the years i helped run our family businesses including the farm and the

may say across the aisle this bill is not about public funding for abortion its really crystal clear that the affordable care act already explicitly prohibits federal funding for abortion it reaffirms the hyde amendment it even includes the nelson amendment to ensure that theres no commingling of funds h r 358 would bring back the infamous world of stupakpitts but this time it adds even more restrictive language to the proposal this bill would essentially ban insurance coverage of abortion in health care exchanges not just for women who are being publicly funded or subsidized in the exchanges but even for women paying with their own private dollars in addition h r 358 would create a system that plays russian roulette with pregnant womens lives when they enter a hospital this would mean that any hospital could refuse to perform an emergency abortioneven if a woman would die without itwithout violating the federal law designed to prevent people from being denied emergency

dead wrong you cannot by cutting 12 percent of the budget the nondefense discretionary budget achieve the fiscal balance that we need and why you have a plan where you attack vermont public radio where you attack planned parenthood where you attack home heating assistance but you leave exempt tax expenditures for oil companies a swollen pentagon budget that means that this is not going to succeed even if we wiped out the entire nondefense discretionary budget we would still have a deficit of 1 trillion so serious budget cutters have a serious plan that puts everything on the table

simply the right thing to do is it not is that not something that is a compassionate principle of the vast majority of the members of the house keeping families together of course it is this bill

currently have and both sides need to come togetherfinally lowering the rhetoricto find lasting permanent solutions this bill is an important step in the right direction it helps address and fix a

talking about in the house here for yearsand both republicans and democrats have failed to deal with this bill deals with that important part so im glad this legislation is finally being considered by

they included questions about the identity and the aims of the rebels the varying presidential statements that seemed to shift like the wind the level of unitedstates involvement the possibility of qadhafi retaliating against american interests outside of libya and whether unitedstates ground troops might well be requested at some point although the resolution seems to clearly say that that

right before it fell so frankly the statement that was made earlier i think did a disservice to those of us who were not supportive of the kosova operation there was no plan to war protect the kosovar albanians we used air power milosevic invaded with ground trops if members will remember that countrys population was literally literally pushed out into macedonia and elsewhereabout 1 6 million refugeesbecause there was no plan when milosevic sent in the ground troops and killed thousands of people because we had no plan to protect them an estimated 10 000 people were killed so the revisionism that somehow republican opposition to the war was a political calculation falls very very far from the truth and its a cheap shot i actually chaired hearings during the war and stated my oppositions based on principle as did other members so i expectand hopeunfounded revisionism would be avoided and that there would not be that lookback that does a disservice on the issue at hand to

shot dead he leaves behind a wife and two children albeit the fact that i have a child here because im simply trying to create a simple amendment to this bill that will protect our law enforcement

enforcement officers have their laptops many of them even their ipads and so this database is a simple process it is interesting or it should be known that 36 states are especially adversely impacted

of power claims of the right to put americans in jail indefinitely without a trial even in the united states now i can cite specifics here the text for example says very specifically that congress affirms the authority of the president includes the authority for the armed forces of the united states to detain covered persons pending disposition under the law of war and then expands the definition of covered persons to people not implicated or supporting or harboring people implicated in 9 11 for the first time and then we have a provision that says nothing in this section is intended to limit or expand the authority of the president or the scope of the authorization for use of military force well that directly contradicts what i just read which is a very specific

protection whatsoever the same is true of the feinstein amendment for similar reasons now we have disagreement we heard on the floor today but that reflects the disagreement in the country at large we have many law enforcement people many legal scholars disagree on what this language means the presidents chief counterterrorism advisor john brennan said that the bill mandates military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects and since it would apply to individuals inside the unitedstateswhich we have heard denied on the floor but the presidents counterterrorism advisor thinks it doesit would be inconsistent with the fundamental principle that our military does not patrol our streets and we have many generals including a former commandant of the marine corps saying that this is a

it only codifies existing law and i can say and all of these other peopleexperts legal experts military people counterterrorism expertscan say it goes way beyond existing law shows why it is dangerous

it is critical that we pass the paycheck fairness act take steps to stop discrimination in the first place by putting an end to pay secrecy strengthen workers abilities to challenge discrimination and

palestinians so that there could be a twostate solution in fact twice once during the term of prime minister barak and again during the term of prime minister olmert israel offered the palestinians a very generous and fair final settlement both times those offers were flatly rejected and met with violence and what have the palestinian authority and the palestinians done recently they went and signed an agreement with hamas hamas is a terrorist organization that has been lobbing bombs and missiles into israel trying to destroy the israeli state they are committed to the destruction of israel and the palestinians have signed an agreement on may 4 of this year to work with them israel went that extra step when they allowed gaza to be turned open and what happened right after that took place hamas came in there and took over and started attacking israel day after day innocent women and children were running constantly from bombs being dropped on them because gaza had been set in a position where they could open up to hamas and so you have got a constant demand by the terroristshamas hezbollah and othersto destroy the state of israel and israel has been a great ally of the united states since its inception in 1948 we need to send a very strong signali think we are doing it right now todaya very strong signal that this country this congress and the senate supports the state of israel and does not want the palestinians to go to the united nations and try to have a unilateral settlement made by that body this is something that has to be worked out at the conference table between israel and the palestinians and not at the united nations so i would just like to conclude by saying that israel is our best friend and ally in the middle east they are a stable element in the middle east we need to support them and make absolutely sure that hamas hezbollah and the other terrorist organizations do not have their way and destroy the state of israel we are committed to that this congress is committed to that and this whole debate has shown very clearly that almost unanimously the people of the united states stand with israel"], [0.018918871879577637,

speak about regulation and ill just wrap up those thoughts that i had before the clock ticked down and take it over to this as i emerged into the construction business that i identified i found myself doing seminars with other people of the same profession around the fivestate area in the upper midwest with our trade association the land improvement contractors of america in that fivestate area as i traveled around and held those seminars i began to ask the questions of selfemployed people most of them had started the business themselves and they were employers doing this in the kind of way that we need to encourage more americans to do rather than discourage them with regulation i began to ask them how many agencies regulate your trade as i asked that question there might be 60 to 70 contractors in a room and we would begin to write down the names of those agencies and yes some of them were divisions within the agencies you can start with the irs and the epa and you go on and on and on osha the mine regulators it continues on but we came to this number of our little narrow trade group 43 different agencies that regulate us and we needed to know the regulations from 43 different agencies we needed to be able to anticipate how they would interpret those regulations and how they would enforce them and then you also had to calculate when they contradicted one another what the likelihood would be of one entity showing up one agency to regulate you versus another if they had conflicting regulations then you ran your operation to try to comply with the one thats most likely to show up to regulate in contradiction with the other that goes on in america every single day there are floors and floors of lawyers and administrative experts whose job it is to try to keep those companies from avoiding the conflict that comes from federal regulations and of course our state regulations that are part of that as well it is a great frustration to enter into a business wanting just to provide that good or that service and do it with in a marketable competitive way to have a margin of profit and control your destiny and raise your family and do those things that are acting out the american dream and find out that a lot of your life is really just tied up in meeting with government regulations and serving this congress and dealing with so many people that can control the destiny of some 300 million americans who have never signed the front of a paycheck who have no idea what its like to not maybe have any capital and go out and build a little bit with some sweat equity and take that little bit of capital and roll it and invest it and after a while find enough margin out there and enough customers that youre compelled to hire a person to help you now theres two people working there instead of one and then you multiply that again and you take some more sweat and your little bit of equity and now you get to double up the equity and now you get to have another employee and another while thats going on youre building a capital base that bridges you through the hard times and the attitude especially over on this side of the aisle is an attitude that employers somehow are victimizers of the proletariats ladies and gentlemen i would say to you that those folks here in this congressand most of them are over on the liberal side of this aislebelieve that employers are victimizers and that employees have a certain virtue to them ill just say that we have good and evil in all of us but the people who risk their capital and many times put everything they have on the line and help stand to lose it all if it doesnt work theyre not taking advantage of the employees theyre giving the employees a job republicans over on this side we say jobs jobs jobs well yes we want those jobs i dont believe that government creates the jobs i think we should stop saying we need to create jobs we dont we need to get government out of the way so that investors can see an opportunity for profit and if they see that opportunity for profit they wont just invest their capital or their sweat they will produce the kind of jobs out there that will sustain people in a market economy thats what needs to happen because first there have to come profits you cant pay payroll very long if you dont have profits which means that youre not going to have jobs unless people make money so what do we do in this congress you people over here you want to punish those people that are making money on this side of the aisle we dont want to call those people that are punishing the people that are seeking a profit because were saying we want jobs we should all say we want to see profit in these companies so that that profit gets reinvested and more people have an opportunity to go to work and receive a paycheck and perhaps a raise and a better benefits package and maybe if that profit gets so great in those companies theyll spin off of there and the people that learn the business going to work for the boss end up in competition against the boss thats another thing that is the american way these kinds of things need to happen organically over and over again in america millions of times and if they dont happen then this country devolves itself down into a europeanstyle social democracy its hard for me to even say those words and think of america in that fashion weve moved in that fashion dramatically the president of the united states doesnt believe in these things that i have described that i think are good hes advocated this keynesian economy on steroids hes advocated for spending trillions of dollars borrowing it about half of that money by the way is borrowed from the investors in america who believe that unitedstates treasury bills are the safest place to put their money and actually it may be if youre going to talk about global currency the other currency has gotten unstable too the euro is in a very unstable unbalanced condition right now they have spent money in the european unionmoney that they didnt have they have built a government bureaucracy much heavier than needed to be ive twice been to greece this year and they have their head in the sand in my opinion they believe that they are the first of a multiple dominos in the eu and that theyre only 2 percent of the gdp of the european union and if theyre not bailed out by the euand that means yes loan guarantees but it gets down to debt forgiveness at a certain pointif theyre not bailed out at a certain point if they default then they will move away from the euro the currency and pick up the drachma again and print their money back in greece a second time or again if that happens they think the euro becomes less stable if the greeks arent involved in it they argue that theyre a domino so if theyre not held up propped up by the rest of europe then theyll fall as a domino and if that happens the euro will start to tumble by the way their domino will clip italy portugal spain ireland belgium name your country over there well it may or may not be true its hard to look at greece and argue that they are a domino and if they fall that theyll necessarily hit one of those other unstable countries that will also fall into one and the other and the other and it will start this cascading effect through the dominos of those unstable countries in europe might not be true it might be true that greece could have a firewall built around it and if they default they default and theyd have to rebuild their country from bottom up inside out back to production again i hope that this doesnt happen in greece i hope that theres a stable economic environment that grows out of europe were tied to them financially with hundreds of billions of dollars invested over into the european banks if they should fail then it hurts us badly were also highly leveraged in this country the comparison of us to greece is one that is considerably disturbing there is a good side to a potential greek default and that would be that it would give this congress a lesson for what america needs to do to avoid a similar calamity i would like to see us steer our way out of this but were here having a debate in this congress about minutiae in proportion to the scope of the problem that we are in we came into this new congress with a new speaker john boehner we have an opportunity with 87 new freshman republicans that came here most of them pledged not to raise the debt ceiling most of them pledged to bring us back to fiscal responsibility and fiscal accountability they all believe that to this day i dont think theyve lost their beliefs but along the way there were a lot of big decisions that needed to be made without time to analyze and so what happened i said the first thing we needed to do was repeal obamacare repeal obamacare repeal obamacare i cant say it enough we need to repeal obamacare if were going to have a country that will function and operate economically again it drives us so deeply into debt that just removing a couple of those components of obamacare according to denny rehberg the chairman of the hhh appropriations committeehealth and human services appropriations committeeit would cut our spending over the next decade by 1 379 trillion it would solve the whole problem of the supercommittee that 1 379 trillion cut that comes just from ending the expansion into medicaid by the way the class act was going to go anyway the administration admitted that they couldnt sustain that component one other component in obamacare was the individual premium subsidy for those who were compelled to buy insurance under obamacare those components totaled 1 379 trillion so we strike those out shut off any funding to that and weve saved that 1 379 trillion that would more than handle the 1 2 trillion that were directed in the debt ceiling deal but this went this way we had a chance coming into this new congress this 112th congress to draw bright lines and to ensure fiscal responsibility and actually fix the real scope of this problem step number one was repeal obamacare we passed that out of this house h r 2 sent it over to harry reid in the senate where he set it up for failure and they shot it down so every republican in the house and every republican in the senate has voted to repeal obamacare congratulations thank you all for doing that we didnt get it done but we got it voted on and its on the conscience of the people that voted no that that monstrosity of a regulation churns its way through consuming 105 5 billion in automatic appropriations that were written deceptively into obamacare in an unprecedented fashion oh yes the tactic had been used before but the scope had never been used like that before and so that 105 5 billion is in there and its around 26 billion in the first 2 years of obamacare this year next year 26 billion being churned away and if we had reached an impasse on our negotiations with the continuing resolution the cr that hit at midnight on march 4 if that had resulted in a showdown that would have been the president causing a shutdown that might have seen the lights go off in federal offices all across the land but you could have driven around the federal buildings here in this city and around the federal buildings across america and where the lights were on in that eventuality they would be on because the money that funds obamacare goes on anyway its automatic they call it mandatory spending and we tried to shut that off as well and we did send the amendment language out of this house of representatives that shut off all of the funding to obamacare and it went over to the senate but it was attached to the bill that went with the cr as an appendage so that they could separate it out and vote it down in the senateand thats what harry reid did in the senate also and so here we are with a congress that began kind of on the right foot with an opportunity to force a showdown with the president of the united states and make him defend obamacare we could have legitimately funded all of the functions of governmentor we could have responsibly funded all of the legitimate functions of government would be a better way to phrase that mr speakerand shut off all funding to obamacare the president of the united states then was predicted to veto a bill like that had he done that he would have had to explain to the american people that his signature piece of legislation obamacare means more to him than all of the legitimate functions of government combined that would have been the showdown it should have been the showdown i believe that we would have prevailed on that showdown and i think the president would have had to accept the funds that we put on his desk in a cr appropriations bill minus any funding that goes into obamacare cutting off all the automatic funding that goes to obamacarecould have would have should have done that we moved past that point the cr was going to be 100 billion in cuts it didnt become that that number went down low enough that ill not utter it just not something that people go back and revisit that even voted for it and then we were going to do yeomans work and cut trillions of spending with the budget bill that came to the floor of the house known as the republican budget resolution that was championed by paul ryan of wisconsin who has done great work here on fiscal responsibility that budget didnt balance for 26 years that was all we could get out of this congress its hard to craft a budget that comes that close he did a lot of hard work on it and laid out some good parameters that we need to pick up and deal with but the budget resolution here on the floor of the house was a promise from ourselves to ourselves that we were going to hold this spending down and this spending allocation was agreed to by this congressby the majority of the house of representatives excuse me the senate hasnt passed a budget in so long i dont remember when and so that budget was passed balancing in 26 years spending too much money leaving us with 23 trillion in national debt 10 years down the road and it was a great step in the right directionnot as strong as i wanted it to be not as strong as the rsc budget which i voted for but the one that could pass that could constrain our spending i voted for them both the rsc budget that balanced in about 9 years and the ryan budget that balanced in 26 years left us with 23 trillion in national debt 10 years down the road that doesnt sound very appetizing to the american public those facts but those facts didnt hold the promise from ourselves to ourselves went kind of out the window when the debt ceiling agreement was presented to the floor of this congress and ultimately passed and in that was a supercommittee in that was a promise to vote on a balanced budget amendment and in that was the threat that if the supercommittee didnt produce a product that could pass the congress and be signed by the president then there would be the sequestrationwhich i dont know where the language of that came from but the sequestration is the automatic cuts that were looking at now i knew when the debt ceiling deal was finally put on paper that we had to go through a number of things one of them was we had to have a debate about how we were going to define a balanced budget amendment well we had that debate and i think i won the debate and lost the decision but nonetheless the clean version of the balanced budget amendment was brought to the floor i didnt call it a clean version i think we needed to have the balanced budget amendment that passed the judiciary committee we should have let the committee work its will the judiciary committee marked up a balanced budget amendment that had a cap at 18 percent of gdp on spending and it had a supermajority in order to raise taxes it was the right thing to do it had exemptions there for a declared war or a case of a serious national emergency and other provisions it was a good constitutional amendment that we could live with that would strengthen this country over the long term we didnt have a vote on that we had the one that said that thou shall have a balanced budget and allows for a tax increase to balance that budget and of course you get to a certain point with tax increases and then you see a decline economically and i think we are past that tipping point today that was another one of our struggles so now were faced with a sequestration im thankful that the supercommittee didnt send us a package that couldnt pass the congress the house and or the senate i never believed that they could they concluded they couldnt reach an agreement there was completely an impasse republicans said were not going to raise taxes and democrats said we arent going to do it if you dont raise taxes they want to punish the people that are producing they would increase the taxesyou guys over there you would increase the taxes on the people that are paying the most taxes you would increase the taxes on the people that are paying the highest percentage you would argue that its progressive and you know youre never going to be satisfied i know you wont be satisfied if i can tell you todayand tomorrow is the first day of decemberthat i have a magic wand and i promise you all that were going to give you what you want and youve got all of the month of december to put your wish list together and when the ball drops in times square in new york on new years eve at midnight and the new year 2012 begins here would be the dealheres the magic wand give me a list of all the things that you want to do to take away the liberty and freedom of the american people take away the wealth and the capital that has been so justly earned by people in this country and redistribute the wealth in the ideal of karl marx or any of the other leftists that you worship grant all of the wishes that you have reorder society according to all your dreams and let you have 30 days to put the list together and at midnight when the ball drops at times square stroke the magic wand give you all your entire wish list if i had that power and if this happened in this fashion i will tell you you guys would work hard your lights are on at night youre well funded and youre smart peopleyoure wrong on your philosophy but you would put together a list and it would be a long list and it wouldnt be without some internal fightsand barney frank will still be there after all so there would still be some of those internal fights going on and in the end if i granted you your wish at midnight at the new year but the deal would be that you had to then stop complaining the rest of your life you would have to live under the rules that you had written that you spent 30 daysall your career wishing and dreaming and working and leveraging for in this congress wed give you everything you asked for on the new year but youd have to be quiet then and live under those rules and i can tell you what would happen you would stay up all night long on new years night thinking what did we forget how did he cheat us we really forgot to leave this in we need to change the rules and were going to want more and more and more because first of all you dont want to admit to the american people what you really want to do youre anticapitalists youre antiamerican liberty youre antifree enterprise there are a number of the pillars of american exceptionalism that you just plain oppose and here we are hardworking american people why do we have all this capital it never was a zero sum game it never was if you look back where was it when the lets say the caveman first went out there and brought a pelt back and turned it into a blanket there was a little bit of wealth that was created out of the labor thats there when they were scavengers and foragers they still made tools and along the way somebody else could make a tool a little better a little more efficient and someone else could raise a little garden and trade some vegetables for some arrowheads whatever it might be someone else could tan a hide better than the person that hunted for the pelt and so they traded labor and in the middle of all of that they acquired things they said ill tell you what lets do two pelts you keep one ill keep the other fine now theres two blankets where there had only been one before and on and on they went building and building and building capital because we had free enterprise capitalism we let people invest their sweat and they turned it into equity and eventually they invented the wheel and along came the industrial revolution where we built things and we put them on ships and we traded around the world and we found that there were resources that were developed in other countries more efficiently than we could here adam smith wrote in wealth of nations about how they had the wool industry going on up in england and scotland and in ireland and so they should be the ones there that were shearing sheep and turning that into clothing and put the wool products that they did so well on ships and sail them down to portugal where they were a lot better at raising grapes and turning that into wine and bring back a load of wine and a ship full of wool and that was the division of labor that he described and both countries were better off whenever there are two people that trade a dollar and its a business transaction or its two or more maybe its three four five or six people in this exchange these business deals are set up because each party benefits there doesnt need to be a loser in an economic transaction and when i hire somebody to go to work for me and i pay them a wage they get something in return they want the money they want the benefits they might want the challenge i hope they do and they want to contribute and we reach this agreement it is a contractual agreement between two consenting adults and so capital is built wealth is built its not a zero sum game gold got mined out by the incas and the aztecs and adam smith wrote about that and he said the spanish galleons went back across the ocean with having cut out the cost of laborhe didnt say by stealing the gold from the incas and the aztecs he said they cut out the cost of labor and once they removed a significant cost of the labor of producing the gold from them they dumped it into the markets in europe and the price of gold went down well supply and demand the cost of the capital and cost of the labor goes together to produce any product that we have there and over the centuries we built ships and we built buildings and we built highways we built bridges and we created cash and currency to trade our labor back and forth with a commodity that would be willing to exchange thats money and then the capital thats built in this world now is trillions and trillions and yes class envy sets in and people think they get a case of the poor mes if government doesnt go hand them a job and i hear some of you that say well the people that want to work should work people who want to work should have a job i would argue that the people that are able to that the people that are able to work need to sustain themselves and they need to contribute to the gross domestic product in this country it is the patriotic thing to do america has created now this culture within us that somehow the federal government is going to guarantee a middle class standard of living to everybody that lives in this country legal and illegal i know youre going to be astonished at this but there are 72 different meanstested federal welfare programs functioning in the united states today 72 of them there isnt a single american that can name them from memory if they cant name them from memory neither can they describe them and if they cant describe them neither can they understand how they function individually let alone understand how 72 different welfare programs can interact with each other and function to provide an incentive for people to do the right thing which is produce for themselves maybe get an education develop some job skills go get a job william bennett told us when i came to this congress that he said he could solve 75 percent of the nations pathologies get married stay married get a job keep a job thats 75 percent you know if hes right on that id say the other percent is substance abuse ill bet we could get to about 99 percent if people would get married stay married get a job keep a job and not abuse alcohol and reject illegal drugs youd solve a lot of the domestic squabbles that go on and this society would go on we need to be a moral society but we are a nation of doers and achievers and our culture is being eroded by those who want to expand the dependency class in america and thats you folks over on that side of the aisle youre in the business of expanding the dependency class in america it goes on over and over and over again and you do that because some of you believe maybe even all of you believe that it is somehow a humane thing to do to take from the sweat of one persons brow and hand it over to someone who wont sweat for their own but you do it because it expands your political base and then you pander to and cater to the people that youre promising somebody elses labor to and you think that americas going to be stronger no were getting weaker weve reached the point now where these 300 million americans that we have when you add upwe talk about how many on unemployment do we have oh it was 15 million now its 14 million you look at the weekly numbers of the new signups and that number ranges down there under 400 000 or so and we think oh it was a good week we had less than 400 000 new signups to unemployment and people run off the other end and they expire and theyre no longer eligible and so that number went from around 15 million unemployed down to around 14 million unemployed or a little more thats not the number that we should be most concerned about it is a number we should add the 14 million that meet the definition for unemployment to the number of americans that are of working age that are simply not in the work force the department of labor has that on their web site anyone can go there i think its dol gov something like that and on that web site youll see different age groups of those working age it starts at age 16 16 to 19 there are around 9 million americans of that working age that are simply not in the workforce yes they may be in school a lot of us worked our way through school and i started before that age of and then you go from 20 on up to 25 or so theres another chunk work your way on up americans of working age not in the workforce when i came to this congress not that long ago were 69 million then it became 80 million and about 21 2 months ago the number for the first time in the history of this country the number of americans of working age not in the workforce now has exceeded 100 million americans100 million think what you could do with the labor of 100 million americans and while thats going on now we have what is our number 11 12 or more million illegals in america i actually think its 20 million or more but they keep tamping that number down they keep coming across the border and the number got lower instead of greater by some analysis but in any case we know this about seven out of every 12 illegals here in this country work thats marginally a little greater than the number of americans that are working and that seven out of 12 that are there are part of around 8 million 7 million to 8 million documented ill say studyanalyzed consensus numbers 7 to 8 million illegals in america that were working now if they all woke up tomorrow in their home country that conceivably creates 8 million new jobs well you know if they werent coming into this country illegally you wouldnt need so many people to go guard the border either and they could do something productive rather than something thats not contributing economically to this country in the fashion that produces goods and services so theres 8 million jobs there but there are many other jobs out there for the people that will go out there and start a business go ask for a job compete in this marketplace and every one of the 100 million americans who are not working that puts in 1 hours work even a week contributes to the gross domestic product of the united states of america people who are not working not producing are not contributing unless of course theyve got investments that are returning and then ill give them some credit for that but 100 million think if you were on a boat or a ship and lets say you had 300 people on that boat or ship and you had to have some trimming the sails some pulling the oars some swabbing the decks some down in the galley some cooking cleaning housekeeping and somebody up there taking care of the captain and what if you had 100 out of those 300 people that said im going to sit here in steerage bring me my food clean up my mess thats the scope of what america is faced with today id put the people on the oars id put them up there trimming the sails and swabbing the decks and we will sail a lot smoother well be a lot stronger country and well feel better about ourselves this dignity of work is there for every man and woman that takes that job on and i challenge us all lets step up take the freedom we have left lets grasp for more of that liberty lets grasp more of that freedom and lets put some of these 100 million people to work so they can contribute to their gross domestic product the rest of the world will respect us more well be stronger economically well have more prudent people that are contributing to the ideas in this congress and we will get to a balanced budget and we will start to pay down this national debt and we will enforce and respect the rule of law i would go on for another half hour articulating some of the other pillars of american exceptionalism but i recognize there is a limit to not your patience but my time i appreciate your attention and i would yield back the balance of my time"]]}
