recognize the true needs and values of our nation we do not need to call in weapons inspectors to find the threat to the majority of americans in this budget nor do we need a warning system we know exactly what when and where the damage will be because the republican budget once again puts the tax cuts of the few above the needs of the many under 1he republican budget the vast majority of americans are asked to sacrifice with one exception the wealthy who can most afford to give something up their tax cutsthe same tax cuts that brought us unprecedented deficitsare protected and even extended under this proposal they will cost our country an additional 106 billion of which 75 percent will go to people making over 200 000 a year in order to pay for those tax cuts the republicans are literally proposing to take away food and health care from lowincome families kill 48 education programs by eliminating the 4 3 billion that funds them slash veterans health careincluding cutting 9 million from medical and prosthetic research and undermine community development in struggling neighborhoods by cutting 1 5 billion in grantprograms despite republican claims these cuts will do nothing to help our countrys bottom line but they will be devastating for the children working families veterans and seniors who will be asked to go without this is not only irresponsible but immoral in the that state of illinois we could see the earned income tax creditthe most effective antipoverty program cut by 164 2 million temporary assistance for needy families and child care grants lose 84 3 million and supplemental security incomewhich helps poor seniors and people with disabilitiesslashed by 174 million thousands of vulnerable peoples lives will be destroyed if the republican budget passes the house republican budget is even worse than the presidents proposal for instance they propose even greater cuts to medicaid than under his plan the 20 billion in medicaid cuts included in this budget resolution are unwise unjustifiable and almost certainly lethal as health care costs continue to rise the number of uninsured americans exceeds 45 million and employers continue to cut back on coverage medicaid has provided a guarantee of support for pregnant women and children persons with disabilities persons living with aids or mental illnesses and senior citizens needing medical care or long term care services without those services millions of americans will no longer be able to get the physical health mental health and long term care services they need to remain healthy and productive in my state of illinois medicaid covers 40 percent of all births 30 percent of all children and 65 percent of ill nursing home residents in illinois under the leadership of our governor we are working to expand medicaid to cover more children and more families in face of a growing crisis in health care this is not just the right thing to do it is the costeffective course to take medicaid costs less tlan private health insurance and its per capita costs are growing more slowly than private insurance premiums but if the republican budget cuts re enacted it may no longer be there for the millions of americans who have no other source of careother than bankrupting their families or mortgaging their futures to pay for their parents long term care needs or their childrens medical services budgets are not just about numbers they are about values and priorities based on the republicans proposal maintaining and making permanent tax cuts for millionaires has been and continues to be a higher priority than meeting the needs of the majority of americans and they are shifting the responsibility of their fiscal mess onto the backs of our children who will see decreased services and will be asked to deal with deficits for years to come the democratic and cbc budgets recognize that this is the wrong thing to do and a great threat to our nations future wellbeing and prosperity it is time to reverse course so that we do not continue to mortgage our countrys future and our childrens prosperity in order to pay for tax cuts for the rich that we cannot afford and that they do not need i urge my colleagues to vote against the republican wmd and for the democratic and cbc budgets"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i thank the gentleman from massachusetts for yielding me this time before we begin this debate i urge each member to ask themselves why did you first seek election to this house it is my hope that it is similar to my reason to represent my hometown to craft laws and policies that will serve the best interests of the families and businesses of that community and to ensure that the world we leave behind is better than the world you and i inherited of late i think congress has forgotten that when i compare the laundry list of items important to my constituents and the american people to what congress is doing a disconnect is apparent an overwhelming majority of americans think it is long past due to increase the minimum wage over the past 6 years this congress has done little if anything to help those earning the minimum wage and the families who depend on them the buying power of the minimum wage is now at its lowest point in 57 years at the sara4 time the cost of key necessities like health care education and gas have been rising faster than inflation yet during the past 8 years members of congress have raised their own pay seven times by nearly 30 000 in those same years minimumwage workers have not gotten a single raise they continde to earn an average of 10 700 a year raising the minimum wage is a real tangible policy decision to significantly help 7 5 million americans who this congress has virtually ignored we can make this choice only by allowing an upordown vote on congressman millers bipartisan bill this bill would gradually raise the minimum wage from 5 15 an hour to 7 25 an hour since february nearly 200 members have signed the petition that would force and upordown vote on this measure and that is what we should have today the only reason we have not had a vote on it is because of the republican leadership they resisted the will of the american people and a bipartisan coalition of members and now that the minimum wage increase will finally be debated by the house it has once again been loaded down with poison pills if the republican leadership really cared about raising the minimum wage they would not have waited until the eleventh hour before the house leaves for recess this is a transparent electionyear ploy i am confident the american people will see it for what it is when a party holds three votes to roll back the estate tax but refuses to allow a clean vote on the minimum wage it is clear where its priorities are while raising the minimum wage will help millions of americans the estate measure will primarily benefit just 7 500 families looking at the majoritys record we should not be surprised there is the series of tax cuts that benefit the wealthiest among us the massively flawed medicare prescription drug benefit and subsidies for oil and gas companies but for those in the middle class and working families there is not much to talk about nothing to help get access to decent health care or build on the promise of stem cell research or lower the price of gas or make college more affordable at the end of today the majority certainly cannot claim to have made a good faith effort to raise the minimum wage and that is truly a shame because you have squandered an opportunity to help the constituents that need your help the most"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i want to start by thanking the gentleman from new york for reserving the 1 hour of time this evening for the congressional black caucus to make preliminary comments on the presidents proposed budget when the congressional black caucus met with president bush on january 26 we presented a cbc agenda that would close disparities and create opportunity we outlined six areas in which significant barriers exist that prevent african americans from enjoying the same quality of life as white americans we requested the presidents support and asked him to demonstrate it both verbally and substantively unfortunately the budget that the president sent to congress yesterday falls far short of the substantive goals that we hoped the president would have set forth to eliminate disparities the first area we presented to the president was in the area of closing the achievement and opportunity gaps in education in his budget the president proposes eliminating the perkins loan program which provides lowinterest loans to low and middleincome college students this proposal would have disastrous effects on african american college students many of whom rely heavily on federal financial aid programs to offset the cost of obtaining higher education as it is african americans attend college at a lower rate than white americans if the president succeeds in his plan to eliminate the perkins loan program a college education would simply be unaffordable and unattainable for many african american college students african american college enrollment rates are 10 percent lower than white college enrollment rates college graduation rates are even worse for african american students only 46 percent of african american freshmen ever graduate from college compared to 67 percent of white freshmen according to the education trust the typical american college or university has a graduation rate gap between white and african american students of over 10 percentage points a quarter of institutions have a gap of 20 percentage points or more in a recent study by the luna foundation for education the foundation found that the single most important financial variable influencing whether or not a student will attend college is the amount of needbased financial aid being provided in spite of these disparities the president seeks to not only eliminate the perkins loan program but he is proposing to eliminate the gear up and the trio programs as well the sole purpose of the gear up program which our congressional black caucus colleague the gentleman from pennsylvania introduced and the trio program both of those programs are designed to prepare lowincome and disadvantaged students for college in other words the president through his budget wants to eliminate the very programs that would help close the achievement and opportunity gaps in education in fact one out of every three programs that the president proposes to cut or eliminate in his budget is in the department of education so the president has not been responsive at all to the cbc agenda in that area the second area we outlined to the president was in the area of health care providing quality health care for every american the presidents proposed budget slashes at least 45 billion from the medicaid program which provides health coverage to 50 million lowincome children working families seniors and others who would otherwise be uninsured the presidents proposed cuts to medicaid would have devastating effects on the working poor and would have particularly devastating effects on african americans according to families usa african americans are generally less likely to receive employerbased health care because african americans are more likely than whites to work in positions where health care benefits are not offered work for companies typically small companies that cannot afford to pay for employee health insurance and to be unable to afford health insurance premiums when coverage is offered the third area we asked the president to respond to was in the area of economic security building wealth and business employment the african american unemployment rate is consistently more than double the average national average in inner cities that number is even larger yet the president proposes cutting the budget for the department of labor by 4 4 percent including workforce investment act state grants further while the african american homeownership rate is over 20 percentage points behind that of white americans the president proposes cutting funding for the department of housing and urban development by almost 3 7 billion we asked the president to address disparities in foreign policy eradicating poverty hunger and armed conflicts around the world especially in africa and the caribbean which is a major component of the cbcs agenda unfortunately the presidents budget offered no solutions on how to strengthen the economic stability and selfsufficiency of countries in the african diaspora the caucus supports reducing the heavy burden that debt has on many countries and reengaging with the united nations regional organizations and countries throughout the world to help promote civil society global health fair trade and peace while we applaud the president for his proposal to fund the global initiative to fight hiv aids we implore him to also provide financial assistance to end the fighting in african countries that are engaged in civil war and in genocide we asked the president to help address retirement security for african americans and the disparities that exist there during the last several weeks preaftent bush has traveled the country selling his social security reform proposal to the american people because african americans rely heavily on the survivor disability and retirement benefits provided by social security the cbc is extremely interested in the details of this proposal contrary to the presidents claims african americans receive a higher rate of return than whites due to their heavier reliance on the full range of benefits offered by social security the cbc has made it clear to the president that we are against any proposal that would result in future benefit cuts or divert payroll taxes from the social security trust fund african americans are 8 percent of all retired beneficiaries 13 percent of survivor beneficiaries and 18 percent of all disability recipients social security is the only source of retirement income for 40 percent of older americans and if those benefits were reduced the poverty rate for older african americans would double almost overnight social security is one of the most effective programs in the history of the united states and is essential to the livelihood of african americans we asked the president to ensure justice for every american the cbc supports criminal and juvenile justice reform that focuses greater emphasis on prevention and rehabilitation reduces recidivism by successfully reintegrating former inmates into society and ends arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences we also strongly support preserving affirmative action until all the effects of past and present discrimination have been eliminated while the presidents budget does include 75 million for a prisoner reentry initiative much more rehabilitation needs to be done for prisoners while they are in prison in addition we are disappointed to report that the presidents fiscal year budget proposes to cut funding for the justice departments civil rights division even while we all know that more enforcement is necessary and despite that fact our election system does not work properly the presidents budget proposes to eliminate grants to states for election reform in summary the budget that the president sent to congress yesterday reflects priorities and values that are not in line with those held by the majority of american families or by the congressional black caucus today the president told reporters that his budget sets priorities he went on to say our priorities are winning the war on terror protecting our homeland and growing our economy i would say to the president that while we fight the war on terror americas families also want to fight the war on poverty while we protect our homeland we must also ensure that american families are able to buy affordable homes while we must grow our economy we must also provide retirement security for american families in times of economic downturn these mr president are americas priorities i hope the president will work with the congressional black caucus to turn these priorities into realities the following is a summary of some of the draconian cuts that the president has proposed in his budget"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "it is of great importance that we undertake bhanges to the tax law with a real understanding of the current budget crisis facing our nation it is simply irresponsible to contemplate tax cuts that are skewed to the very richest in our country when americans are facing the largest deficit we have ever seen the congressional budget office projects a federal deficit of approximately 337 billion for this fiscal year alone that number does not reflect the approximately 181 billion that has been borrowed from the social security trust funds to pay for government programs unmasked the true deficit counting what is being pulled out of the trust funds is well over half a trillion dollars for this year alone the administration has cited the large deficit as an excuse for massive reductions in education and health programs and that is for the nations least welloff pursuing additional tax breaks for the superwealthy would further jeopardize the remaining safety net for children the disabled and other vulnerable individuals in the future just 2 weeks ago republicans in congress voted to increase the nations public debt lirmit again where did the money go one need only connect the dots to see where the republicans priorities lie madam speaket this administration and congressional leaders have hit bottom it is irresponsible and it is immoral to direct current deficit spending to tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest 1 percent of the country yet this is the trajectory that has been pursued by many of the republican conferees further these republican conferees would be willing to mortgage the cost of this gift to the wealthiest taxpayers on the back of every man woman and child in this country and it is evident that most of the republicans have these misplaced priorities beyond the sheer irresponsibility of enacting these skewed tax cuts the republican leadership has underscored its time to the gentleman from california stubborn and steadfast commitment to a member of the ways cutting taxes on investment income and means committee and

increases in the lief from the sprawling reach of the senate version there are not enough amt without this relief american tax increases to cover the cost of this families could see an increase in taxes motion to instruct as large as 3 640 this relief is cer let me just say the motion to intainly a priority that this congress can struct seeks to include amt relief in and should not ignore

provisions to extend the ternative minimum tax ontside of rectax cuts on the capital gain and divi onciliation dend incomes in 2009 and 2010 these re amt relief cannot be passed within duced rates do not expire for another 2 reconciliation without raising taxes or years there is plenty of time to extend as i said violating the budget some those benefits in the future if it is de amt relief for middleincome taxtermined to be appropriate and afford payers is inside included in reconciliable ation the bill does have a provision it seems misguided at the very least that allows families who claim perto allow the extension of this very sonal tax credits targeted to lower and skewed tax cutto take priority over middleincome families to use those tax relief that is vital to 17 million credits to offset their amt liability americans the house extends both forms of amt and finally my motion instructs relief without raising taxes as the senconferees to not increase the burdens ate did on our children and grandchildren in and let me just say this motion to the future by insisting on a conference instruct excludes our effort to extend report that does not increase budget the lower rates on capital gains and deficit and does not decrease the pub dividends which provides broadbased lic debt limit tax relief the motion to instruct seeks the increase passed 2 weeks ago was to deny that broadbased tax relief by the fourth such increase in the public refusing to extend the lower rates on debt limit during the bush administra capital gains and dividends tion the presidents own budget envi the amt extension which my sions the debt rising to 11 5 trillion by friends on the other side are so in favot 2011 of benefits a targeted class of people in for too long misguided republican a few states lower rates on capital policies have funded a series of lopsided gains and dividends benefits a much tax cuts for the wealthiest of ameri broader group of taxpayers according cans by jacking up the debt a burden to the joint committee on taxation that our children and grandchildren the extension of the 2001 amt provimust bear it is simply unfair to mort sion affects only 14 million taxpayers gage these policies on the backs of fu in contrast capital gains are reported ture taxpayers by more than 26 million taxpayers and even in normal times the republican dividends are earned by more than 35 fiscal policies would be shocking but million taxpayers many of these taxthese are not normal times we are fac payers would be adversely affected ing a war in iraq we have enormous when lower rates expire in 2009 deficits we have done nothing to en also joint committee data shows sure the solvency of social security that in 2005 95 percent of taxpayers hit and medicare

below 100 000 only onetenth of a pergether to get the wheels back on this cent had incomes below 50 000 fiscal wagon in contrast nearly 60 percent of the i ask unanimous taxpayers with incomes less than consent to transfer the balance of my 100 000 had income from capital gains and dividends one in five taxpayers with capital gains and one in four taxpayers with dividends have incomes below 50 000 let me also just say that h r 4297 is within the current budget constraints the congressionally approved budget allows for up to 70 billion in reconcili ation tax relief and h r 4297 complies with the budget the motion to instruct seems to indicate that my friends on the other side want no action on the tax reconciliation bill they do nothing about the expiring provisions which would lapse including several items many of my friends on the other side have talked about including the r d tax credit work opportunity tax credit and qualified zone academy bonds also the motion implies that the conferees should accepttax increases proposed by the senate that would lead to raising taxes in a number of ways which have drawn bipartisan concern so for these reasons i oppose the motion to

the members that outside the office of every blue dog member of congress every fiscally conservative democrat in the congress there are 37 of us we are 37 strong and as one walks the halls of congress it is easy to spot a blue dog member because beside their front door next to that welcome mat is a poster that will demonstrate and remind the taxpayers of this nation of a number that unfortunately changes and goes up every day today the unitedstates national debt when we went to work this morning was 8 121 trillionandsomechange again for every man woman and child that is a citizen of this

is it a commonsense idea and does it make sense for those who send us here to be their vpice and to represent them so this discussion this debate here on the house floor is not about pointing fingers it is about accountability it is about accountability to the american citizens it is about accountability to the taxpayers and this congress is not being accountable when it has driven up the largest

stump speech and having the press conference with security homeland security all this kind of stuff but when it comes down to the printed word when it comes down to the budget that is handed out from the white house and when it comes down to what this republican majority does it is 2 000 from what the 911 commission called for and what we called for as house democrats versus the presidents proposal and you can look it up on line that only asks for 210 agents democrats fought for the funding on almost five different occasions again for the record ms wasserman schultz h r 1268 a motion to recommit and 2 000 vote number 160 and that happened on 5 5 05 also you look at house bill 2360 was blocked it was an obey amendment vote number 174 that was on 5 17 05 it failed 223 to 185 on a partisan vote h r 1817 a motion to recommit 2005 again vote number 188 again failed on partisan lines you start talking about on border security and closing the gaps on nine separate occasions over the last 5 years democrats put forth motions here on this floor because that is the only thing we can do being in the minority we are not able to bring the bills to the floor because the majority is blocking those bills from getting out of committee and they are noted right here and i am not going to go through that at this particular time but all of this is on line housedemocrats gov if anyone wants to go on and get this information also when you start talking about aviation security democrats offered a motion to require air cargo to be screened within 3 years the motion was rejected by republicans again 2005 vote number 188 5 18 05 democrats have spoken repeatedly on the issue of transit security making sure that we authorize including a 2 8 billion initiative to improve transit security and a 1 billion initiative to improve rail security substitute amendment defeated again so when you start look looking at the record and what the record says versus what is said here on the floor by the republican majority and the rubber stamp majority i wish the rubber stamp republican majority would stop fighting us and start saying to the president guess what we no longer want to rubber stamp everything that you send here i just wish the republican majority would just leader up and say hey mr president so you start reading the paper could someoneget me a newspaper please because i want to just have it as a prop because as americans start reading the paper they are reading about how republican members of the house and the senate the president flies into town they get on the plane and leave town some even get in their car and go i was on the other side of my district well let me tell you something if the president of the united states is in my district i think i would know i think it would be some sort of news flash or some sort of email that would come to me and say you know the president is coming in your district today will be in an elementary school maybe you want to be there he is the leader of the free world maybe you want to be there the reason why they are taking flights while the president is coming in the reason why they are finding something else to do while the president is in their town is the fact that they dont want to be caught in the same situation with the president of the united states because they have not stood up to the president and said no you cant put us in a financial situation as far as the eye can see as it relates to deficits and foreign countries running the world you cant pick up the paper today not talking about a republican running from the president of the united september 12 2006 co states and dont want to be around when the president is around or explaining why they are not there that is some excuse i hope i never get to the situation where i have the president of the united states coming into my district and i have to explain that i am somewhere else while the president is there and the bottom line is this people cannot face the music when it comes down to dealing with the policies of this administration and better yet you being in the position there is only 535 of us being in the position as i come in for a landing ms wasserman schultz to be able to bring about change on behalf of the american people to say this is not going to happen to say i know you want to start a war in iraq but we still got this business over here with al qaeda who had everything to do with 9 11 who trained the individuals that carried out the 9 11 plot but meanwhile while we are over therelooking for osama bin laden and we have him cornered i got this unfinished business the president said over here in iraq because i got a problem with this leader over here we got to take him out but what about the after player what is going to happen once you get to baghdad how are you going to bring stability who is going to be in the coalition calling up a couple of friends ill send 25 troops ill send 30 troops you are not allowed to talk about it everything is secret we have the then sitting attorney general comes to the unitedstates congress over on the senate side and tells the senate you are either with us or you are with the terrorists 0l 2340 what kind of mess is that so when it comes down to article i section 1 and if the american people want the kind of representation they need i am not talking as a democrat even though we were given an hour by the deqiocratic leader and we are all members of the democratic caucus this is america i guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot ms wasserman schultz i cannot help but imagine the kind of chaos and protest and finger pointing and them and they and all of the things that will be said some of the stuff will have to be stricken from the record because the republican side will be carrying on about the democrats but they cannot say it they cant do it they cannot even kind of paint a picture because they have been in charge of the whole thing since it started so if the american people want a new direction if the american people want accountability if the american people want a house and a senate that will carry out article

are getting either it be katrina or the war in iraq they are getting theirs i am looking at the issue of health care and all of the people that are running to the bank with all of the dollars and all of the influence and all of the access into this congress they are getting theirs meanwhile we are sitting around here talking about the minimum wage and we cant even get a doggone bill passed off this floor to be able to provide the american people with a minimum wage meanwhile we are giving ourselves a nice fat pay raise every year 4 100 here 3 100 there oh we have the money for that but we dont have the money for the people who are punching in and punching out every day this has to come to an end and that is the reason why ms wasserman schultz that i believe there is a wind of change it may not be outside the hall of this chamber but it is out there in america it is in towns and it is in big cities and it is in emerging areas and it is in young people and older people that have

routine updating of various spreadsheets not by a fulldressed presidential dogandpony show but president bush plans to preside today with members of congress and invited guests in attendance by all indications including his own in his weekly radio address last saturday he plans to turn this into a celebration just in time for the fall campaign the editorial from the los angeles times dated july 11 2006 continues this is proof if anyone still needs it that this administration is desperate for something to boast about on mr bushs watch tripledigit budget surpluses have turned into annual tripledigit budget deficits there is no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly dispiriting fact yes the report is expected to project that this years deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last years probably somewhere between 280 and 300 billion versus a 318 billion shortfall in 2005 and it concludes that part of the editorial by saying that is not much to crow about well they are right last week the administration released its midsession review of the budget and after further examination lets take a closer look at what the report actually tells us the report actually tells us that what we have here is another record deficit the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit makes 2006 one of the four largest deficits in our nations history it is hard now to believe that we had a balanced budget in this country from 1998 to 2001 but it did not take this administration and this republicanled congress very long to turn fiscal responsibility into record deficits i 2000 as you can see the largest deficit ever in our nations history occurred in 2004 when the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was 413 billion in red ink in hot checks if you will the year 2003 was the second largest deficit ever in our nations history where for the first time in over 50 years the republicans controlled the white house the house and senate and they gave us the second largest deficit ever in our nations history 378 billion the third largest record deficit ever in our nations history again occurred while the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was in 2005 and it was 318 billion deficit the third largest deficit ever in our nations history then this year the president has a press conference has a grand ceremony and event to announce that the deficit for fiscal year 2006 is only 296 billion the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history i think the editorial in the los angeles times had it right when it said that is not much to crow about the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit as i indicated makes 2006 the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history while this number represents an improvement over the 2005 deficit of 318 billion it still ranks as the fourthlargest deficit ever in our nations history these revised estimates do not account for the extent of our budget problems because they include in the calculation the annual surpluses in social security the first bill i filed as a member of congress when i got here in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund this republican congress refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why because they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund this outofcontrol deficit this outofcontrol debt this reckless spending that we are seeing occurring in our nations capital and the way the republican leadership is running our government and thiscountry in fact when the social security surplus is excluded as it should be the 2006 deficit is not 296 billion it is 473 billion now throughout the evening we are going to be talking more about this including projected surpluses and how they became huge deficits i will talk more about that in a little bit but i have been joined this evening by the cochair for policy for the blue dog coalition jim cooper from tennessee glad to have you with us this evening"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "today i rise in support of the spratt substitute and in opposition to h con res 95 the house republican budget a budget is a blueprint of values and prioritiesa road map for where we want to move the country it is no surprise that the republican budget for fiscal year 2006 is more of the same continued tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by slashing programs that rhode islanders depend on however the spratt substitute contains thoughtful polities to balance the budget by 2012 without individual tax rate increases or harmful cuts to security health care education veterans benefits and other programs that improve the quality of life for rhode islands working families while the republicans claim that budget cuts are needed to return to fiscal discipline they forget their own policies caused todays financial problems without the tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of americans enacted since 2001 our nations fiscal health would be much rosier and the neediest and most vulnerable americans would not be forced to sacrifice their fiscal year 2006 budget proposal continues to move in the wrong direction and next years deficit will likely be the largest in history with at least 400 billion added to the national credit card how does this blueprint make us safer while the department of homeland security receives an overall increase in funding the budget largely follows the presidents request which cuts needed resources for the first responders who risk their lives every day to protect us the spratt substitute contains 1 1 billion more than the republican budget for vital law enforcement programs such as cops fire grants and byrne grants these programs provide rhode islands police and fire departments with the equipment and training to keep us safe how does this blueprint make us healthier the republican budget requires 20 billion in cuts to medicaid this reduction will jeopardize a critical health care safety net for seniors children and people with disabilities and shift more of the burden to states medicaid cuts would result in 80 million less for rhode island the loss of federal funding places an enormous burden on states like rhode island by pressuring them to cut eligibility for medicaid my state has successfully leveraged federal medicaid dollars and currently offers coverage to many vulnerable lowincome pregnant women parents of young children and other groups not included in the federal mandate without medicaid these people would likely join the increasing ranks of the uninsured lacking proper preventative care these patients will be forced to go to emergency rooms leading to long waits and higher costs for everyone these cuts will also threaten programs such as rite share an employer buyin program funded in part by medicaid the republican medicaid cuts are restored in the spratt substitute how does this blueprint prepare children for the future again the republican budget matches the presidents proposal to eliminate 48 education programs that provide assistance with vocational education education technology civic education and school counselors in contrast the spratt substitute provides 4 5 billion in additional funding for no child left behind and other valuable programs such as student loans and school lunches giving students the resources to succeed how does this blueprint honor those who serve our country in uniform perhaps most egregiously during this time of war the republicans want to cut veterans health care by 14 billion over five years impose new fees and increase copayments for veterans health care adding an undue burden to those who have served their country so bravely the spratt substitute provides 17 billion over five years to provide veterans the services they have earned through their patriotism and sacrifice the republican blueprint does not make us safer or healthier prepare children for the future or honor veterans by continuing failed tax policies while cutting effective programs that rhode islanders depend on their proposal is a misguided and unjust starting point as democrats show it is possible to create a realistic blueprint that is fiscally responsible and builds on the needs of the american people i urge my colleagues to support the spratt substitute and reject h con res 95"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "you know

with the commander of the air combat command lieutenant general william fraser and many dedicated indeed dedicated members of the united states air force as part of the air force caucus trip we had almost 50 people participating in the trip much of this trip focused on the f a22 raptor and its importance to the future of the united states air force after visiting with general fraser and seeing the raptor up close i am more convinced and i think the participants who went on this trip are also convinced that the f a22 will become an integral part of future military successes during my visit i was briefed not only about the warfighting capabilities of this plane but about the maintenance program as well the air force uses cuttingedge technology to maintain this plane and this of course leads to more efficient maintenance it is the first jet to use an entirely paperless maintenance program allowing new parts to be ordered or changes to be made significantly faster the engine also utilizes new technologies its design allows it to be worked on while still on the plane that is the engine in the past engines often needed to be removed in order to be maintained this is not the case for the f a22 these new technologies mean less time in the shop and of course more time in the air also the maintenance training program has been improved no longer are there these big bulky maintenance manuals the training is digital in realtime with realworld conditions it leads to more effective and efficient training maintainers spend less time in training and more time actually working on the plane this of course leads to faster maintenance and thus the f a22s are not grounded for longer than is necessary in the past and particularly in the postseptember 11 environment homeland security has been our top priority here in congress and our nation the f a22 plays a large role in protecting the homeland according to the air force 238 legacy fighters would be required and needed to protect this homeland while only 150 f a22s would be needed the bush administration unfortunately has proposed cutting 10 billion from the f a22 program over the next5 years leaving enough to buy 183 of the 381 planes the air force says it needs simply put in my judgment this number is just not sufficient the air force will not be able to guarantee air superiority without a sufficient quantity of f a22s the unitedstates has not lost a soldier due to an air attack since 1952 the air force has made air superiority look so easy that we have begun to take it for granted but maintaining this air dominance is not easy for now the united states air force is the best trained the best equipped in the world but russia china india have made huge strides in achieving parity and in some cases have even surpassed unitedstates capabilities our current but badly aging fighters no longer enjoy technological or aerodynamic superiority when compared to the modern aircraft of potential adversaries there have been some recent exercises pitting the f15s which the f a22 raptor will replace against one of russias primary export fighters resulting in kill ratios favoring the suin contrast on a recent training mission where a single f a22 went against five f15s the raptor killed all the f15s within 3 minutes additionally due to a lack of stealth assets the ability of our aircraft to operate in environments where hostile threats exist is inadequate the only way to address these shortcomings which will only worsen i tell my colleagues is with sufficient numbers of the f a22 raptor we cannot fight tomorrows war with yesterdays equipment that is why america needs the raptor with a variety of internal weapons the raptor can destroy or negate the most capable future threats advance fighters surfacetoair missile systems and highvalue mobile ground targets the f a22s combination of speed stealth and integrated avionics bring unmatched capabilities to cope with the 21stcentury threat environment air dominance gives the joint force freedom from attack freedom to maneuver and of course freedom to succeed no substitute exists for the f a22s unique capabilities with the international proliferation of sophisticated aircraft and air defense systems unitedstates fighters are losing their ability to leverage access for unitedstates forces in hostile regions the f a22

many fought and died to obtain their freedom the struggle between proslavery forces and abolitionists was fought across the country and significant battles took place in my home state of kansas during the 1850s the outcome of bleeding kansas was a free state in the heart of an expanding nation that offered hope and opportunity to former slaves while the end of the civil war brought with it expectations that african americans would finally enjoy the rights described in our founding documents many rights obtained were largely stripped away by the end of the reconstruction period many recognized the sacrifice that kansas had made to become a free state ex slaves left the south and ventured out to the vast prairies of kansas in search of freedom and opportunity the destination for many of these individuals was nicodemus founded in 1877 by six african american men nicodemus was formed as a community specifically for african americans at a time when prejudice and oppression were still common nicodemus offered african americans a place to own their own land to make a living farming and to prosper in a jurisdiction allowing self government the young community of nicodemus grew and prospered during the 1880s as a result of the ingenuity of black entrepreneurs and the dedication and commitment of black farmers though many african americans in the south were denied an education nicodemus established schools and educated the towns children since the bustling activity and growth of the 1880s nicodemus has had its ups and downs yet it today remains a community of african americans and a testament to the human desire for freedom nicodemus is the only remaining western town established by emancipated slaves during the reconstruction period and it is critical

georgia for yielding let me make one comment about your chart i am a cpa i have spent 30plus years assisting clients in dealing with our very complicated very convoluted federal income tax code whether it is individually or corporations or other businesses any system that is based on a fair concept is flawed because what is fair to one per sons view is not necessarily fair to somebody elses point of view when you base a public policy this broad and expansive and quite frankly invasive on fairness then you set yourself up for a constant argument and constant battle about what is and is not fair clearly your chart shows a differential between the wealthiest folks in this country and the folks that are on their way up to hopefully becoming the wealthiest in this country certainly they have got that opportunity with hard work and applying themselves to that so i would just like to point out that maybe we need a different system maybe sometime next year let us have this conversation about a different way to collect the minimum amount of money needed to fund this federal government and we will have that conversation i would like to comment though on health care and individual responsibility i think it is universally recognized and that is a hard thing to state with a straight face but i think it is universally recognized that americans enjoy the finest health care delivery system in the world you yourself have been an integral part of that as an orthopedic surgeon and your wife i believe is an anesthesiologist members of the delivery system that this country enjoys we have got a flawed payment system and i am not sure how we got to this point and place but we are here we have got a system that if you ran your car insurance program the same way we run health insurance then each time you needed to change the oil in your car or new tires you would file an insurance claim that is not how we work our cars we figure out a way to operate our automobiles out of our normal monthly budget we budget for that and take care of those incidentals we do have car insurance for the catastrophes for wrecks for destruction and theft those kinds of things those catastrophic deals our health care system is flawed in that quite frankly i get the services you provide me the services and someone else pays for those services in that scheme i am not as concerned about the cost of those services as i ought to be because i am not writing a check to help out with that so i have no incentives so to speak to ask you are there alternatives to what you have proposed is there another way to do this or cheaper way can we do it at some other hospital that can be a little less expensive than the one you typically practice at because i am writing those checks getting personal responsibility back into the health care system getting a system in which i have a viable interest in asking that question we may ask that question on every other single thing that we do how much is that going to cost we may not ask it out loud but we make a costbenefit analysis each time in our head each time we make a purchase on something such as how do i want to pay for that we do not do that in medicine and it needs to be communicated to all of us that that is okay to do in medicine there are some things in medicine you do not ask emergency or catastrophic kinds of things you go get that thing there is an awful lot of medicine that i think is subject to a circumstance where we can ask what that costs and i think just doing that would begin to drive down those costs as the example i went for an annual checkup a year or so ago and had an issue the physician said well i can prescribe a course of antibiotics that is about 300 a month and 3 months from now that condition will clear up i have got a prescription drug card so it was going to cost me 15 or whatever i said 900 he said yeah i said well what happens if i do not do that he said in about 3 months it will clear up i made a costbenefit analysis and decided that i would forgo the antibiotic treatment and go with the professional judgment it was my decision i need to stand behind that decision and if 3 months later my condition had gottenworse and i had other problems that may have been fixed if i had taken a different tack i cannot go back on the doctor or should not and sue the doctor or the pharmacy or whatever sue anybody that is still breathing because of a decision that i made personal responsibility is not only taking responsibility for paying for health care but also reclaiming your health care decisions because those are yours you are responsible for that and you yourself know there will be the occasional bad outcome to any procedure to any field and that is just nature doctors are not perfect or hospitals none of us are those legitimate just bad outcomes is just the system and we ought to take personal responsibility for that i had several doctor clients and to a person if they did something wrong if they created an issue or made something that aggravated something with a patient they were going to fix it period no matter what it was but in many instances they used their absolute best professional judgment to treat a patient and they just got a bad outcome that is life so this personal responsibility issue that i am talking about is decisions for what health care you do get or you do not get and the costs i think the health savings accounts that we have instituted in certain instances will help us do that so that putting away money in a health savings account if you have a normal monthly kind of an expense come up i have to decide do i take that money out of my health savings account that is growing or do i figure out a way to do it out of this months budget or my normal operating budget so bringing that personal discipline back to the table in the arena of health care is not the absolute overall magic bullet but it is a piece of the fix that is health

want an arms race in the region so i would say that this is an important step we need to engage we need to work with india and pakistan together i ask my colleagues to support this amendment the united states relationship with india and pakistan is of paramount importance to our nations political and economic future with the receding of the cold wars global divisions and the new realities of globalization and transnational terrorism we have embarked on a new era of promise possibility and uncertainty this means the united states the worids only superpower bears an especially heavy responsibility to remain engaged in all regions of theworld with all nationstates my amendment is simple my amendment is important my amendment is necessary and my amendment is bipartisan due to the strategic political and economic importance of the south asia region it is imperative to our national interest to continue our policy of engagement collaboration and exchanges with and between india and pakistan particularly since this has served the nation well in the past my amendment which is endorsed and cosponsored by congressman burton and which is not opposed by either the majority or minority of the committee on international relations simply states that the south asia region is so important that the united states should continue its policy of engagement collaboration and exchanges with and between india and pakistan peaceful nuclear cooperation with india can serve multiple unitedstates foreign policy objectives so long as it is undertaken in a manner that minimizes potential risks to the nonproliferation regime this will be best achieved by sustained and active engagement and cooperation between india and the united states similarly pakistan has been a critical ally in the global war on terror pakistan has been a good friend to the people of the united states although h r 5682 signals no change in this countrys relationship with pakistan it is not difficult to understand why it may give pause to some supporters of pakistan this is another reason why it is vital for the united states to continue to engage both ppkistan and india in ongoing political engagement economic and technological collaborations and personal exchanges which will bring the united states closer to these two vitally important democracies in the south asia region and will bring india and pakistan closer to each other as a founding cochair of the congressional pakistan caucus i am wholeheartedly committed to the political economic and social amelioration of pakistan for the pakistani people and the ascendancy of pakistan in the intemational community pakistan has been a loyal and unwavering ally in our global war on terror which has played a decisive role in helping to remove the taliban regime from afghanistan and the capture of hundreds of wanted alqaeda terrorists pakistan has suffered thousands of casualties and has been a victim of numerous terrorist acts on their own soil because of their steadfast alliance with our nation in the global war on terror in order to get a proper perspective on pakistan i believe we must take a look back at the luminary individual who is singularly responsible for its creation pakistan one of the largest muslim states in the worid is a living and exemplary monument of muhammad ali jinnah becoming an architect of a dream first articulated by poetphilosopher muhammed allama lqbal a brilliant young lawyer named muhammad ali jinnah valiantly dedicated his life to achieving an independent pakistan for indian muslims revered as the father of pakistan muhammad ali jinnah inspired the adulation of his people through his eloquence perseverance and dauntless courage for over 30 years muhammad ali jinnah was the prominent leader of indian muslims who articulately gave expression coherence and direction to their legitimate aspirations and transformed their dreams into a concrete reality a visionary leader who was ahead of his time muhammad ali jinnah was a great constitutionalist and nationbuilder who called for the equal rights of all pakistani citizens without regard to their religion in the past six decades the people and nation of pakistan has come a long way the bonds of friendship which began with muhammad all jinnah continue today with president musharraf i am grateful to the people and government of pakistan who in the aftermath of the devastation and loss of innocent life which occurred on 9 11 and on the eve of the 5 year anniversary of 9 11 continue to support our efforts to

was as a page in 1941 that john dingell was standing on the house floor when president roosevelt asked congress to declare war on japan it was world war h that would ultimately call him to service he served in the army with distinction rising to the rank of second lieutenant john would later say of his service it taught me the meaning of discipline and respect two qualities which i believe are key

great judgment and his broad vision to making the future better for generations to come john always made clear that a strong america had to be a healthy america continuing a tradition his father began in every congress he has introduced a bill for universal national health insurance because of his tireless work in securing health care for the elderly john presided in the house in 1965 when medicare was passed into law the gavel he used that day still sits on his desk he was a very young man at the time still is as part of his focus on future generations john was one of the first elected officials to link public health with environmental health and he has had a hand in almost every major environmental legislation of the past 40 years he has done as much to clean up government as he
