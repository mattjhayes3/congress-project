only question is why start with us otherwise let me mention very briefly because i know members would like to conclude at an early hour today that this bill has nothing to do with the programs at usda this bill is solely to consolidate reorganize and streamline if anyone has any interest or concern in the programs that will be dealt with next year on the farm bill this is also not about money although this bill saves some money about 2 5 billion but what we do in agriculture is serve all of the people since it was started by president lincoln the guidance and the direction is to serve farmers and ranchers to promote economic and community development in rural areas to provide good assistance and educate the general population about proper nutrition that is across the spectrum in the united states to promote soil and water con1servation clean air clean water to meet other environmental gbals in rural areas to ensure the quality and safety of our food and to carry out agriculture research economic analysis and educate the american public this is the extension service the research the land grant institutions all of those areas are covered under the mandate of the department of agriculture but this consolidation and streamlining under h r 3171 is done to accommodate the changing times let me say that in the beginning that now from the peoples department of president lincoln it is still the peoples department but almost 60 percent of the department of agriculture budget is devoted to domestic nutrition programs only 20 percent of the budget is devoted to the farm commodity program so the reorganizing we are dealing with here and the streamlining of usda 60 percent entails the domestic programs it deals with the nutrition food stamps feeding the elderly nutrition information 60 percent also we have the forest service and soil conservation that is only like about 9 percent rural development is about 8 percent and as i mentioned the commodity program but everything that usda does entails supporting programs that bring income the balance of trade where we deal with the world everything on agriculture manufactured items there is one here one there that is selling but collectively we have a deficit of about 125 billion a deficit the only thing that brings money in collectively is agriculture about 18 to 20 billion and i have a chart here the green part that is agriculture collectively the red part that is everybody else so that is what we are dealing with also let me state the top 10 entitlements the bottom one of the entitlements is the price support programs that we have for agriculture but of the top 10 entitlements it is the only one projecting a decrease in cost 1 4 percent in the years between 1991 and 1997 we are dealing with food safety we are dealing with all of the agencies of the department of agriculture all of the offices out there in the countryside and this bill gives the secretary authority that he does not have to reorganize and to meet the challenges that the people of this country have presented to us the bill also requires the secretary to reduce personnel and staff over the next 5 years we have local elected farmer committees closer to field offices that might save some money so madam chairman the bulk of this legislation is basically technicalto consolidate to streamline and to make in 1994

past several years the presidio has been the subject of extensive discussion and debate as of october 1 1994 the presidio by law was transferred from the unitedstates army to the national park service

even more remarkable by its location in the middle of a major urban metropolitan area sites throughout the presidio provides views of the pacific ocean the golden gate bridge the matin headlands san francisco bay and the skyline of san francisco the presidio also contains numerous recreational resources where visitors hike bike and tour scenic trails and drives the golden gate national recreation area is currently the most visited unit of the national park system and the addition of the presidio will provide millions of national and international visitors with the opportunity to enjoy and learn from this truly unique area the challenge facing us is to preserve the national assets of the presidio in a manner which is sensitive to the budgetary constraints of the federal government this concern is bipartisan and it is shared by congress and the administration the congress has already acted once to reduce costs at the presidio by authorizing the national park service to lease the 1 8 million square foot letterman lair hospital complex the measure we are considering today takes the next step by establishing a public benefit governmdnt corporation to lease the remaining presidio properties and reinvest the lease income into repair and rehabilitation of structures the activities of the national park service and the trust will be closely monitored by the authorizing and

entrenched bureaucratic practitioners of foreign aid and fully contributed to a lack of accountability establishing what amounts to a permanent international entitlement program at this turning point

more integrated with our foreign policy measurable and achievable goals should be established tough standards should be adhered to and elements of reciprocity should be demanded as a result of our

the federal hazardous substances act to justify issuing the regulation codified in h r 965 in the case of bicycle helmets the cpsc found it unnecessary to create a mandatory standard because there was not one but two voluntary standards which bicycle helmet manufacturers used this bill represents congress willingness to interfere in a rulemaking process which we designed i strongly believe that if we do not like the outcome of an administrative procedure it is incumbent on the congress to change the process and not try to address serious problems only on a productbyproduct basis however this bill does address serious dangers to children and substantially improves toy labeling the labels required by the legislation clearly warn parents of the choking hazards posed by toys with small parts small balls marbles and balloons too often parents may assume that age labeling refers to a childs innate ability this bill makes that distinction clear also there will be benefits associated with the improved standard for bicycle helmets developed under this legislation this bill harmonizes the existing voluntary standards into a single mandatory standard that must be met by both domestic producers and foreign suppliers because of the importance of these provisions to the safety of children i will support passage of h r 965 in the future however i hope the congress will choose not to interfere with rulemaking processes of its own design"], [0.8719861507415771, 0.8719861507415771, 0, "for their support and assistance in moving this legislation to the floor today with the unanimous bipartisan support of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs the principal purpose of the bill which will be explained at greater length in a minute it to permit the exportimport bank whichnow cannot finance any defense good and service unlessit is used solely for civilian purposes or is used primarily for antinarcotics purposes to consider financing for defense goods and services that are nonlethal but only ih the narrow set of circumstances when the unquestionably primaryuse will be for civilian purposes without this legislation we do not have a unitedstates government export finance program that can accommodate dualuse items that are used primarily for civilian purposes h r 4455 as amended was passed by the committee on banking finance and urban affairs on june 29 1994 by voice vote it was reported by the subcommittee on international development finance trade and monetary policy on june 24 by a vote of 17 to 0 the amended version includes the provisions of my original bill h r 4455 and other provisions added to respond to concerns raised by members in the course of the hearing and other consideration of h r 4455 in section 3 the amelnded bill also includes a separate provision added by representative kennedy relating to eximbank promotion of exports of environmental goods and services the original bill corresponding to the first fourteen lines of the amended bill provides an exception to the current prohibition on eximbank financing of exports of defense articles and services but only in cases where the article to be exported is both nonlethal and the primary end use is for civilian purposes thus the bill provides a narrow exception to the current law and it is this members intention to keep the exception narrow this member does not consider the eximbank to be an appropriate agency for financing defense sales for primarily military purposes nor for sales of lethal items many other members share this view an example of an item which cannot now be financed by eximbank but which would be permitted if this bill is passed is radar for air traffic control systems if the radar feeds into both civilian and military air traffic control systems the bill would allow such export sales to be considered for eximbank financing as long as the primary use is for civil air traffic control it does not make sense to cede to our trade competitors the whole field of hightechnology dualuse electronics when the military use or involvement is clearly secondary and subsidiary to the civilian use this step is consistent with the direction of conversion that many defense industries are seeking and being encouraged to pursue and the current inflexible policy impedes export sales of such nonlethal dualuse items that are destined primarily for civilian purposes the bill is supported by the aerospace industries association and the electronic industries association among others six items have been added to the original bill in an abundance of caution first there is a requirement that each transaction proposed for financing under this exception must be reported to the house and senate committees on banking and on appropriations at least 15 calendar days in advance of final approval by the eximbank board of directors this is similar to the reporting requirement of the appropriations committees this provision has been included to respond to the desire of members that close ongoing congressional oversight of the implementation of this provision is needed in order to ensure that this discretion is properly and narrowly construed second as an additional safeguard the provisions of this legislation will sunset on september 30 1997 at that time after about 3 years of experience it will be timely to assess whether this provision should continue in law in the context of the next full reauthorization of the exportimport bank third as a further safeguard against crowding out of other commercial sales the bill limits the amount of eximbanks funding that can be devoted to funding the sales made possible by this bill the cap is set at 10 percent of eximbanks available subsidy appropriation under credit reform fourth the gao will be consulting with eximbank annually and reporting on the end use of articles financed under this provision to provide a followup assessment of the actual use of articles financed fifth section 2 of the amended bill requires a quarterly report on any transactions financed under the authority provided in the earlier part of the bill eximbank already files a quarterly report with the two banking committees on any transaction involving a defense sale which will be used solely for civilian purposes the transactions financed under section 1 of the bill would be added to this quarterly report lastly in section 3 there is a provision on eximbank promotion of exports of environmental goods and services added by representative kennedys amendment during committee consideration this provision was also the subject to a separate hearing by the subcommittee earlier this year in response to questions raised by members at the hearing about the necessity of guarding against fraudulent representation of the primary end use of a sale our staff had lengthy discussions with eximbank personnel about the current eximbank practice in assessing sales with military potential the committee expects the exportimport bank to contfnue its present policy of working with other appropriate unitedstates government agencies to review transactions with military sales potential to determine whether they meet the standards established in this legislation regarding nonlethal nature and the primary end use being for civilian nurposes the bank is expected to continus its present practices of investigating the prospective use of dualuse items and those buld to military buyers requiring the buyer or user to provide a certificate that the use the article or service satisfies the requi ments of the legislation assessing whether civilian use is primary according to a standard requiring unquestionably and strongly predominant civilian use monitoring the actual use of the items especially if there is any reason to suspect that the actual use does not conform to the agreed use requiring accelerated repayment of loans if the buyer has misrepresented the intended use and using other available sanctions such as debarring from access to future exportimport bank credit any buyer or user that violates agreed limitations on the nature or use of the defense articles or defense services financed by the bank the banking committee expects that the eximbank will continue these prbcedures with respect to transactions financed under h r 4455 in order to guard against and deter any fraud and misrepresentation the committees understanding of the term end use is the intended application or use of an item or service as represented by an applicant for financing from the exportimport bank it is worth noting that h r 4455 only addresses the question of export finance any sale of controlled items requiring export licensing still must have whatever licenses are required before being eligible for export with or without eximbank financing it is further worth noting that while the bill slightly widens the universe of goods and services that eximbank is allowed to finance eximbank would not have to provide financing in any particular situation it would still be using its normal financial standards to assess the merits of a particular export deal again this member would like to thank the chairman the gentleman from massachusetts and a number of other members including appropriation chairman obey and representatives kfnnedy and watt for their assistance and that of their

strike the lastword there is a little confusion here on the part of the issue as i see it and that is why i wish to comment on it first and foremost we have to clarify the separate issue we are concerned here with existing activities in the desert on the part of narcotics smugglers and other types of illegal activities not the least of which are meth laboratories and a number of other facilities which are stationary but temporary until they are caught now if there are meth laboratories established and operating in what is currently a proposed wilderness area to be made into wilderness tinder this bill then without this amendment law enforcement is hampered by the fact that it cannot move into the wilderness area for enforcement purposes therein lies a problem that i have the purpose of this amendment is simply to insure that local enforcement agencies will be able to continue their diligent work in these areas to quote the sheriff of riverside county it is absolutely critical that they retain unrestricted access to all wilderness areas that are to be created by this bill in the desert it is a welldocumented fact that the bad guys are not going to conduct their illegal activities according to the land uses in this bill undei this bill congress will designate 8 million acres of california desert as protected wilderness how long do you think it will take for drug makers to figure out where to set up their meth labs or illegal alien smugglers to figure where to hide their human contraband that certainly is not rocket science without regular access by law enforcement there areas will be congressionally designated safe havensfor criminal activity li 1240 it is therefore essential that law enforcement be provided unrestricted access to all wilcierness all wilderness which will be created by this bill including the use of motorized vehicles let me read for my colleagues two quotes from law enforcement agencies which provide some detail as to the nature of criminal activity in just one part of the desert the riverside county sheriffs department in conjunction with federal authorities recently conducted operation range rover this was a coordinated effort to stem the flow of narcotics through the riverside county desert area the scope of the project was from the mexican border north to interstate highway 10 between blythe and indio as a result of this operation we confirmed intelligence indicating that this area is a major thoroughfare for illegal narcotics including marijuana cocaine and heroin this path is chosen by smugglers to avoid detection by law enforcement authorities there is also the problem of illegal immigration through the area cois byrd sheriff i would point out that two of the wilderness areas to be designated in riverside county the orocopias and the chuckwallas are part of the area in which we are now discovering criminal activity taking place and would be convenient passages north from the border in imperial county therein lies the reason i am standing here i wish to do another quote here i can tell you that smugglers of both aliens and narcotics often attempt to circumvent our traffic check operation located on highway 111 north of niland california they do this by walking and driving vehicles through the chocolate mountains naval bombing range utilizing existing roads that cut through the chuckwalla mountains and eventually intersect with interstate 10 which carries them into the los angeles area and points outward on july 11 1993 we seized 899 pounds of cocaine worth 28 million attempting to traverse this area johnny williams chief patrol agent unitedstates border patrol these are wide open and rugged areas interlaced with designated wilderness areas in this bill to patrol them effectively we need to maintain a constant enforcement presence in order to bust heavily armed drug traffickers our law enforcement people cannot hike into a wilderness area on foot nor can they charge up on horseback regular motorized access is essential to interdiction and enforcement operations in this kind of terrain it should be clear by now that these deserts are a major conduit for the narcotic garbage that is polluting the youth of our country much of these drugs go on to the big cities but 1 can tell my colleagues that far too much of it stays in my district i have

although h r 3351 is admittedly a grant program for punishment alternatives for youthful offenders i think it is incumbent upon us as a united states congress to do everything that we can to try and stem the tide of violence which is occurring in our schools because it is a horrendous problem it seems like every day we are reading in newspapers and watching on tv the violence which is occurring with weapons inside our school systems just yesterday a student went into a high school in my community in rhode island i could stand here all day and give you examples of the most horrendous crimes which are occurring in our school systems every member in this congress probably could site examples which are occurring in their districts granted this is not just a control problem it is much larger

unnecessary at 1 100student dartmouth high school in a pretty university town 50 miles south of boston where the sons and daughters of professors studied alongside the sons and daughters of yacht owners and fishermen the federal government honored the school for excellence in 1985 so it was a shock when two dartmouth students and a third teenager burst into james murphys government class on april 12 armed with a bat a billy club and a hunting knife police say they attacked freshman jason robinson 16 one went after him with the bat and as murphy wrestled with the assailant a second plunged the knife into robinsons abdomen killing him robinsons friend shawn fins 15 had fought with one of the accused attackers earlier a student in murphys class pins had been suspended after the fight and was not present when the three arrived allegedly looking for revenge what was the provocation for the killing of this student because robinson asked why they wanted to see pina until recently violencehas not been associated with our schools but today more than 3 million crimes a year are committed in our 85 000 schools in this nation two weeks ago new york mayor david dinkins announced plans to station city cops in all of their new york public schools at an estimated cost of 60 million this trend is terrifying we as a congress must do something when we read studies such as a michigan study which reports that 9 percent of 8th graders carry a gun knife or club to school at least once a month in all an estimated 270 000 guns go to school every day these days attending school represents an act of courage for many students sixteen percent of 8th graders 14 percent of 10th graders and 12 percent of 12th graders told university of michigan researchers that they fear for their safety in our school systems so what can we as a unitedstates congress do about this problem can we cope and develop solutions the problem admittedly as i indicated goes well beyond criminal laws it involves the breakdown of family it involves unstructured undisciplined lives in many of your young people it involves the violence inciting wrath it involves violence on tv and regrettably and unfortunately it involves young people who in the words of a recent article suddenly and chillingly respect for life has ebbed strongly among teenagers if our schools cannot teach brotherly love and if they cannot teach the golden rule at least they ought to make sure that the students understand that if they commit an act of violence with a weapon in the school there will be swift and unpleasant justice for them as our states are trying to cope with this enormous problem madam chairman we as a congress must address it and we must do all we can my amendment says that if states are going to qualify for these monies under this bill in 3351 as a factor for consideration which is the first change which we just amended they must first provide that if a juvenile is in possession of a firearm or other weapon on school property or convicted of a crime involving the use of a weapon on school property they would be suspended for a reasonable time second the school would determine that the assailant would lose driving license privileges for a reasonable time as well finally the ban this amendment which has been revised bans firearms and other weapons in a 100yard radius around the school property except and this is an important exception that the state may allow exceptions for school sponsored activities as well as other reasonable exceptions this would take into consideration the person who has a home next to a school a car which is parked across the street or some other incidental act we are not banning weapons which are intended for legitimate purposes but what we are

to be addressed by the unitedstates congress and this is the beginning while there are some who might suggest that the gunfree school act of 1990 already takes into consideration what i am suggesting that particular bill has been determined by the unitedstates court in california the district court as unconstitutional as exceeding the unitedstates congress power under the commerce act my bill by

thousands of north dakota residents with high quality drinking water from the missouri river wetlands would be restored since the 1986 reformation congress has appropriated well over 100 million to construct the newly reformulated garrison project i have supported each and every one of those funding requests unfortunately however local sponsors of the project the garrison diversion conservancy district have repeatedly attempted to rewrite history and the law by repudiating the 1986 garrison reformatibn act their obvious intent is to resurrect the old garrison project complete with outdated expensive and wasteful irrigation late last year north dakota leaders and the garrison diversion conservancy district asked reclamation commissiondr beard to initiate yet another new process to determine north dakotaes contemporary water development needs the commissioner with the concurrence of all north dakota political leaders insisted that all north dakotans internally reach consensus on any propesed changes to the 1986 act when the governors proposal was issued just a few weeks ago it was promptly rejected by the north dakota congressional delegation eight years after we passed the reformulation act the delegation has advised the united states that our state is owed this project and that north dakota will not have to reimburse the federal government for major features of this project if the state of north dakota and its congressional delegation are not interested in constructing a major water resource project for the benefit of their citizens i see no reason why congress and the taxpayers should be expected to force the project upon them i intend to convene a hearing of the committee on natural resources to receive testimony on legislative proposals to further reform and perhaps even deauthorize the garrison project i would say that i have been given a letter that has been written to michael whittington the area manager of the bureau of reclamation by the delegation which has a statement by the congressional delegation that they plan to go back to start a new collaborative effort to produce concurrence among all of the interests in north dakota and to produce consensus legislation that they will introduce in congress to modify the garrison reformulation act that is clearly their right to do so i would welcome and would participate with them if necessary with the committee on natural resources i must say however in that same letter dated may 12 to mr whittington that i am deeply disturbed by the suggestion that somehow this project is owed to north dakota and that they should not have to pay for what they should receive as compensation this project when it was passed in 1986 as a reformulated project was very narrowly passed by the congress by a handful of votes those handful of otes were secured by the effort of myself and many others to represent to the members of the congress that there would be consensus that there would be a fundamental reformulation and there would be repayment of this project that is what we did in 1986 after long negotiations on both the house and senate side to now suggest that somehow unilaterally one party or the other within north dakota is going to change the purposes and the intent of this act is simply unacceptable i hope that perhaps this letter is more reflective of the desire to enter into a true consensus rather than simply a onesided discussion within the state about changes that some may seek or think are advisable in this act i include for the record the letter to mr whittington with regard to the garrison diversion reform proposal"], [0.0015451908111572266, 0.5015451908111572, 1, "and mr liowtfoot for bringing this bill to the floor today which attempts to balance all the needs i also want to thank the staff for all their work on this bill john berry from mr hoyers office and the subcommittee staff bill smith betsy phillips jenny mummert and robyn bason have put in many long hours to get this bill to the floor from the minority michelle mrdeza and christie cohen should be congratulated for their work this is a responsible bill it stays within the limits of the budget act within the 602 b allocation allowed by the appropriations committee and it is less than 1 percent above the fiscal year 1993 level specifically this bill contains a number of important provisions which help federal workers and their families two of which i want to highlight here today the first ever federal government telecommuting center is expected to open on september 7 in winchester va the telecommuting centers in which federal government employees who normally commute long distances to reach their jobs in the washington area would be able to instead work 1 or 2 days a week at a federal facility nearby their home workstations with computers and telephones will be set up to allow these workers to perform their jobs closer to their homes closer to their families it also cuts down on rush hour congestion and on pollution chairman hoyfr and i have worked very hard to bring this concept to reality and i am pleased that two telecommuting pilot projects will soon be open this bill also contains a provision i authorized which allows federal government employees to use accrued sick leave for the adoption of a child right now federal employees may use sick leave for the natural birth of child but not for adoption purposes this new provision would give adoptive parents the same option as other new parents two years ago my amendment created a 1year government pilot project for adoptive parents was highly successful with many families participating unfortunately i understand that the adoption language may be stricken on a point of order for legislation on an appropriations bill that is very frustrating to me adoption of a child is one of the greatest moments in the lives of many americans and if a parent misses the opportunity to spend time with his or her newly adopted child that opportunity can never again be available striking this provision is unfortunate i would appreciate the house post office and civil service committee passing this in the congress"], [0.0016045570373535156, 0.5016045570373535, 1, "i think one of the things that struck all of us this year is how fragile civilization really is before we got too smug about thinking that it was just overseas we had some incredible events happen in this country to remind us that things can come unraveled here too i believe after the horrible murder of the doctor outside the clinic yesterday in pensacola where he was shot in the back i think that says to all of us we must work together and make one of the highest priorities access to being able to get into health clinics we cannot allow people to take the law into their own hands and say they are answering to a higher law and therefore able to murder when you look at the incredible history of this case where people were handing out posters with the doctors picture on it saying wanted where people were having prayer services saying they really wanted to go after the specific doctor and they are also targeting many other health care workers this is very very serious to this democracy and i hope this body acts and acts forthwith on the clinic violence bill and then moves to make access to health care one of the most important human and civil rights there s so that we do not have any more actions likethis and we make it very clear we are firmly against it"]]}
