earning and working hard a system that would be obstructive of capital formation we could not have done a better job our tax system is the largest impediment to people moving from the first rung of the economic ladder to the second because the harder you work the more you save the more you invest the more we take it is a system that is inefficient we have seen testimony from the kemp commission to harvard studies that says for a small business man or woman to comply with the code and to collect and remit 1 in business income taxes it costs them anywhere from 4 to 7 the current code is not understandable our own irs tells us that if you call the irs for help in filling out your own tax return 25 percent of the answers they give you will be given in error over 50 percent of americans have to pay others to decipher the tax code and do their taxes for them in an effort to show how complex the irs code has become money magazine created a fictional american family and asked tax professionals to prepare an irs tax return incredibly every one of the tax professionals came up with a different tax total and not one of the tax professionals calculated what the editors of money magazine believed to be the correct income tax the current code invades the privacy of every single american citizen there are 100 000 people at the irs who know more about us than we are willing to tell our children i want them out of our lives these are not bad people they are people doing the job that this congress by statute has directed them to do but we should not have any agency of government that knows how much money you make or how you spend it that should be none of our business we should not have anybody who can look into your records and know your history the government

simple tax return that you would get if we move toward a flat tax under our system we would have no tax return at all and you would never have to keep a receipt or a record not one let me simply say

year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty once and for all let us make the elimination of the

in some instances over the last 7 years than our president has been able to do in outlining the priorities that you happen to believe in and putting real numbers with those priorities your numbers add up the concern i have with the presidents budget and it is probably the reason why the congressional black caucus and so many others are providing substitute amendments is they do not agree with the priorities that the president has laid out we did not agree with that either we felt it was important to protect 100 percent of the social security trust fund to strengthen medicare and provide a real prescription drug benefit within that to retire the public debt entirely to promote tax fairness for families farmers seniors to restore americas defense and to do it in a way that recognizes that

run to the floor today to talk about how their plan looks exactly like the republicans and there is a reason because when the democrats or through the president provided their original proposal what we found out is that the way they paid for a prescription drug benefit was by cutting medicare you cut medicare in one side to pay for increases in another side and those increases did not even take effect to the fourth year so the president held this great rose garden ceremony and had a great 96minute state of the union address and he said how we were all going to have prescription drug benefit and then didnt fund it in the budget he proposed 2 weeks later so i can understand why you would come forward with a substitute amendment a substitute amendment that hopefully does not cut as the president does the kidney program the hospital payments as i said to a gentleman earlier today you cannot close hospitals around this country and extend a prescription drug benefit and call that

reorganization of a native hawaiian government and the recognition by the united states of the native hawaiian government on january 17 1893 the government of the kingdom of hawaii was overthrown with the assistance of the united states minister and unitedstates marines one hundred years later a resolution extending an apology on behalf of the united states to native hawaiians for the illegal overthrow of the native hawaiian government and calling for a reconciliation of the relationship between the united states and native hawaiians was enacted to law the apology resolution acknowledges that the overthrow of the kingdom of hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the united states further it acknowledges that the native hawaiian people never directly relinquished their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over the their national lands to the united states either through their government or through a plebiscite or referendum since the loss of their government native hawaiians have sought to maintain political authority within their community in 1978 hawaii citizens of all races recognized the longstanding efforts of the indigenous people to give expression to their rights to selfdetermination and selfgovernance by amending the state constitution to provide for the establishment of a quasisovereign state agency the office of hawaiian affairs the state constitution provides that the office is to be governed by nine native hawaiian trustees who are elected by native hawaiians the office of hawaiian affairs administers programs and services with revenues derived from lands which were ceded back to the state of hawaii upon its admission into the united states the dedication of these revenues reflects the provisions of the 1959 hawaii admissions act which provides that the ceded lands and the revenues derived therefrom should be held by the state of hawaii as a public trust for five purposesone of which is the betterment of the conditions of native hawaiians the admissions act also provides that the state would assume a trust responsibility for approximately 203 500 acres of land that had previously been set aside for native hawaiians under a 1921 federal law the hawaiian homes commission act four weeks ago the house resources committee and the senate indian affairs committee held five days of joint hearings in hawaii on h r 4904 and its companion in the senate s 2899 more than 150 people presented oral testimony to the committees and several hundred others presented written testimony the testimony received by the committees was overwhelmingly in support of the bills in addition to witnesses from the native hawaiian community representatives of the departments of justice and interior the president of the national congress of american indians the president of the alaska federation of natives and the president of the central council of tlingit and haida indians presented oral testimony in support of the bills with the passage of h r 4904 the congress will provide a process for the reorganization of a native hawaiian government and the recognition by the united states of that government for purposes of carrying on a governmenttogovernment relationship this bill provides that the indigenous native people of hawaiinative hawaiiansmight have the same opportunities that are afforded under federal law and policy to the other indigenous native people of the united statesamerican indians and alaska nativesto give expression to their rights to selfdetermination and selfgovernance it is also important to note that the united states congress has enacted over 160 laws designed to address the conditions of native hawaiians these federal laws provide for the provision of health care education job training the preservation of native languages the protection of native american graves and the repatriation of native american human remains thus the reorganization of a native hawaiian govemment would not necessitate a host of new federal programs to serve native hawaiians nor would the reorganization of a native hawaiian government have any impact on programs or the funding for programs that are authorized to address the conditions of american indians and alaska natives for the last 90 years native hawaiian programs have always been funded under separate authorizations with separate appropriations some have asked whether the reorganization of a native hawaiian government might also authorize that government to conduct gaming the answer to that question is a simple no the indian gaming regulatory act authorizes indian tribal governments to conduct gaming on indian reservations or indian lands held in trust by the united states and the scope of gaming under the act is a function of state law but there are no indian tribal governments in hawaii nor are there indian reservations or indian lands and the state of hawaii is one of two states in the union that criminally prohibit all forms of gaming in developing and refining this measure we have worked not only with the a community but with representatives of the federal and state governments with leaders of the alaska native and native american communities and with the congressional caucuses the bill that is before the house today has been revised as a fesult of the testimony received at the hearings in hawaii and in washington d c our objectives are simple and straightforward as a matter of federal policy and federal law we want to assure that the united states government deals with all of the indigenous native people of the united states in a consistent mannerrecognizing and supporting their rights to selfdetermination and selfgovernance this is the right

as we bring our bill to the floor the fiscal year 2001 appropriation for agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies i want to also begin by saying that this is the last bill that will be managed by my dear friend and colleague the gentleman from new mexico as chairman of the subcommittee because his limited subcommittee chairmanship has been reached under current house rules which i certainly would like to change he is and has been such a leader a fine gentleman in the true sense of the word a caring chairman an advocate for americas farmers and ranchers and a true friend to every single member of this institution so i wanted to acknowledge his hard work on this bill it has been a joy to work with him and i number these days and years among the most memorable of my own life i also want to thank the subcommittee staff hank moore martin delgado john ziolkowski joanne orndorf and our detailees anne dubey and maureen holohan and to the minority staff leader david reich and roger szemraj of my own staff for all the hard work that has gone into putting this bill together let me begin by saying that i come to the floor rather conflicted this morning this is a very very important bill and one that we will focus on today but we have just learned that contrary to an agreement that was reached yesterday the majority has chosen to place the sanctions language dealing with cuba and libya the issue that we debated for hours here yesterday into the supplemental appropriation bill contrary to an agreement that had been reached with the minority this is creating a great disarray that i think threatens not just this bill but the supplemental and its ability to move through the congress and also to be signed by the president there are many programs in there such as firefighting and so forth that are needed immediately in the western part of the country i would just urge the majority to remove that sanctions provision from the supplemental legislation this is a violation of an accord that had been reached with the minority and it truly places us in a most difficult position as we proceed forward with this bill today now let me say that this bill deals with the basics of life that touch every american every day have already touched every one of us as we awakened this morning the food that we have eaten the fiber that we wear the fuel that we use to move vehicles and in industry and forest production all the land and water conservation programs that cover the vast majority of private lands in this country the stewardship of those lands and the help that goes to those landholders is contained in this legislation the food that we ate this morning no doubt was influenced in millions of different ways by the research that has been supported over the years through th unitedstates department of agriculture all the marketing programs the safety that we felt when we ate that food that the milk was okay and that it was very healthy to eat the various medicines that we take our certainty that that medication will do what it says and if there is a side effect that it is labeled all of the food and drug administration programs come within our jurisdiction so this is a very important bill that goes to the center of life in america and we hope by our example that we can influence the worlds people as well the bills spending level is at about a level of 75 3 billion nearly a little more than 80 percent of that or 60 billion is what we call mandatory spending money that we have for important programs like the commodity credit corporation reimbursements that are central to the operation of our farm as sistance programs to those who produce that food fiber and forest product so there is 27 7 billion in the bill that goes to that major segment of this proposal the food stamp program which helps those who cannot afford to feed themselves in this country 21 2 billion contained in this bill an even more important program as welfare to work locks in across this country and our feeding kitchens and elderly feeding programs and so forth become short changed our school lunch program 5 4 billion so that every child in this country will have decent food at least during the week while they are in school 5 4 billion and 1 5 billion for the school breakfast program so those little ur chins out there their brains grow and as they go to school they are able to lead healthy lives and that they grow properly our conservation programs nearly a billion dollars here working with all the private owners of america to make sure that the land and the water and the ditches and the runoff is handled properly we are making progress there but we certainly have a long way to go this is an incredible piece of legislation of the total amount of spending 75 3 billion the discretionary amount the part our committee struggles with so greatly 14 5 billion is unfortunately 400 million below the spending of the current fiscal year this is a very tight bill hard choices had to be made in fact the entire bill is 400 million below this years spending when we discount the nearly 8 7 billion that was provided in emergency assistance last year now i said that this bill came forward under difficult circumstances the most recent nick however being the fact that the sanctions language was put into the supplemental against the will of the minority and against the agreement that was reached the allocation we were given by the committee on the budget makes it difficult to detail with responsible priorities submitted by the administration we are at least 1 6 billion in this proposal under the administrations request for all programs and as i mentioned 400 million under last year if we look at what was done in the supplemental which is linked to this bill directly there was nearly 400 million in the supplemental that we were expecting to help cushion the cuts and the lack of full support in this bill and we were told yesterday that that has now been reduced by 204 million which means that there is only about 195 million left in the supplemental which absolutely underfunds these programs at a time when rural america is just caving under the continuing low price situation the drought the high water levels in other parts of the country to be underfunding agriculture at a time when rural america is in recession makes absolutely no sense to this member now the bill as best as we were able to try to fund programs that are so necessary does have some additional problems for example in the animal and plant health inspection service we do not provide the resources requested by the president in fact we are 53 million below his request for funds to deal with the growing infestation in this country by invasive species other pests and viruses for example in the area of citrus canker in florida where entire orange and lime crops are threatened we do not have funding sufficient to deal with the eradication nor with trying to prevent further spread of that particular problem the same is true with pierces disease in california the administration released about 12 million this past week but that is not sufficient to deal with the vineyard problems all throughout california plum pox in states like pennsylvania which are affecting our fruit crops all of these dollars that were proposed by the minority to try to deal with the animal and plant health inspection service have not been fully provided i can tell my colleagues that failure to deal with these pests and failure to deal with prevention will mean costs in the future of billions and billions and billions of dollars to deal with something like the asian longhorn beetle which is destroying our hardwoods in chicago and in new york this is not an insignificant issue it has longterm consequences there are cuts in this bill unfortunately for the food for peace program june 29 2000 co 37 million below the presidents request we keep saying that access to foreign markets is what will help our farmers recover from low prices but at the same time we disarm ourselves by failing to provide the level of resources we need to get the job done and move our product into other markets certainly when we have a surplus to those people in our country and around the world who remain hungry and in fact in many quarters of the world that are starving in this bill also we fail to adequately fund or place restrictions on the use of funds to deal with the problems faced by the most needy and the most powerless people in our country for example there are insufficient funds in this bill for the 1890 colleges those colleges that have been dealing with those historically discriminated against in our society as we try to spread the knowledge of the department of agriculture in all of its different aspects throughout the university and college systems of this country further the bill prohibits further expansion of the colonias initiative to deal with the tremendous pollution at the southwestern border of mexico with texas new mexico and arizona so there is no additional funding in the bill for that important effort finally if we think about our food programs in general the underfunding is largely in the area of food programs certainly food stamps our school breakfast our school lunch our elderly feeding programs the women infants and children feeding program totally the funding in this bill is about a billion dollars under the administrations request on the conservation front which is so important to us as the most productive land on earth the conservation programs are 65 million below the presidents request in what we were able to provide in this bill with the significant erosion problems the drought problems and in my part of the country the significant water runoff problems right now they are having a real impact on our ability to hold soil and prevent leaching into our ditches rivers and ultimately lakes these conservation programs are more important than ever now in terms of the overall bill while we do not provide all prudent increases that i have just talked about we do not cut most programs under current operating levels and we do provide some modest increases in rural economic and community development programs and we have provided vital support for the food and drug administration i would be remiss if i stood on this floor however and i did not remind members that in this supplemental bill however there were severe cuts made in important agriculture

of the process that we presently find ourselves today unfortunately president clinton vetoed the foreign operations bill and with that veto he made the statement that we did not have enough money in the funding for the things that he wanted in terms of foreign operations as we have struggled this year to limit the spending in this congress so that we do not touch social security money part of the way we have done that is to flatline the amount of money that is spent on the foreign operations bill in fact it is the only bill that we sent to the president that is somewhat less than the spending from the year before that bill as i recall was 200 million less than what we actually spent last year as we think about the options spending money and the 1 7 trillion budget that we have i think it is important to look at what the president said in his own statement of administration policy which was issued august 4 1999 in terms of his desires for the commerce justice state appropriations bill which this motion to instruct is directed at on the second page of that he talks about international affairs programs which ties back into what he vetoed today in terms of the foreign operations bill it is his message that the committee underfunds activities to support the ongoing conduct of effective diplomacy and does not fully fund payments to international organizations necessary to ensure unitedstates leadership in international affairs this weekend i happened to share my weekend on call that i do every 4 weeks in my medical practice in oklahoma starting friday night about 11 30 and finishing up about 4 30 this morning 10 young oklahomans came into this world the debate we are going to be having with the president whether we want to or not and whether we talk about it now or whether we talk about it in the future is going to be focused on these 10 young lives the fact is that the congress and the president all too often make decisions in the short term and in the short run what we find in the commerce justice state bill is many international organizations i thought i would just kind of look at what the bill as coming out of the house funded in terms of international organizations and affairs programs that the president objected to i just want to spend a minute talking about those there is 1 949 000 for funding the following programs the international copper study group the international cotton advisory committee the international lead and zinc study group the international rubber organization the international office of the wine and vine the international rubber study group the international seed testing association the international tropical timber organization and the international grains council the amount provided includes funding for travel and for arrears as we looked into some of these i think it is very important that the american public knows what these organizations do and remember this money very likely if the president has his way will come from the future benefits of these 10 babies that i delivered this weekend their future is going to be compromised because we are going to borrow money from their future to actually pay for this 1 949 000 let me give my colleagues a little outline of what the international office of the wine and vine does first of all remember that the wine industry in america exports 537 million worth of wine each year and it is growing each year in 1999 we sent 64 000 to this international organization i want members to know what we got for our money so we did a little research it turns out that the international office for the wine and vine wrote the rules for the chardonnay of the world competition that is a healthy very important thing for our taxpayers and these 10 new babies from oklahoma to be saddled with in the future a qualitative confrontation of the worlds best chardonnay that is where the american taxpayers dollars are going but that is not all the international office of the wine and vine also wrote a press release touting a danish study that confirmed that the consumption of wine has health benefits well our own surgeon general said that 15 years ago we know that and actually that was all we could find that they actually did for 1999 for 64 000 now let us talk about the rubber the administration has proposed funding not one but two rubber organizations dedicated to supporting the rubber supply industry not the rubber manufacturing industry but the rubber supply industry we spent 300 000 on the international rubber organization last year 111 000 on the international rubber study group the first organization we spent 300 000 what is their job to keep the price of rubber high to keep the price of raw rubber high we are a total importer of rubber raw rubber we produce no raw rubber in the united states so we spent 300 000 asking that organization to help keep the price of our imports high the third organization the international copper study group established in 1992 we spent 77 000 what did we get for our money you ask according to the web site you can order a number of products from the international copper study group we spent 77 000 but you cannot get any of that information unless you pay them bigtime bucks 350 for a report a directory of the copper mines in this country is 350 and if you want to use their database another 550 the american taxpayer has already paid for it these dollar figures do not sound like much but when we put it in perspective it does i want to pull up a couple of charts for a minute and let the members of the house see just in these international organizations 475 american families their tax rate if the average family is earning 55 000 they are paying 4 100 in federal income taxes that is what they are paying to fund this looking at it a different way the average senior in this country earns 9 396 receives that in terms of social security payments if we look at the amount of seniors that is the equivalent of shipping 207 seniors receipts overseas for programs that the president wants us to spend more money on in terms of international organizations mr president we are not going to spend a penny of social security this motion to instruct is to reaffirm what the house has already done and to say that we are going to stand by the appropriated amounts and not go any higher than the house level the senate version actually is somewhat lower we would expect you to be a better steward of our international moneys all we have to do is look at what has happened in russia we do not need more money for foreign aid because the money that we are sending in foreign aid whether it be through the international monetary fund whether it is through the world bank we are not a good

the south and the west now in this crisis we need to have some help not a great deal of help but enough to make sure that our people are not put in danger this coming winter"], [0.001004338264465332,

who worked on this bill and produced a bill that is fair and meets the needs of the house this bill basically deals with the safety of the buildings it also ensures security for the personnel that work in this building and those who visit this building but this building is mainly about personnel and that is how we treat our employees who work in our offices to make sure that we are effective and efficient i have to tell my colleagues that i commend the chairman of the subcommittee the gentleman from north carolina he was very fair yery bipartisan we had the hearings we developed this bill in a bipartisan manner and we were cognizant of the needs of this house it is a responsible bill through the subcommittee as my colleagues were told earlier by unanimous vote this bill was forwarded to the full committee on appropriations and the committee on appropriations unanimously on a voice vote forwarded it to the house it is with great disappointment i must now vote against this bill we thought this was a fair bill that the members would accept it and adopt it we did not expect a long time in its debate or in bringing it forth in fact we were so confident that this bill would be accepted that as we talked about the calendar we thought that it would take a few minutes it would get adopted and the members would be able to leave early well here we are late at night and it is taking a while to get this bill through the house it is a fair bill and the reason i have to ask the members of the democratic conference to not support this bill is that the late developments are that they are requesting a big reduction in the members allowance we had in that allowance considered a costofliving increase for our employees these are the men and women who work for us who make sure that we represent our constituents very well it is our feeling that what was a reasonable bill a fair bill now is something that we cannot support i know there will be debate but it is our position that our employees who work very hard for us long hours also deserve consideration when it comes to a costofliving increase i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.001011580228805542,

shuster the gentleman from new york chairman boehlert the ranking member the gentleman from minnesota and the ranking member the gentleman from pennsylvania for their excellent work as a first term member of this committee i am impressed with the efficiency and the bipartisan cooperation and the outstanding staff i want to thank the members for considering and authorizing on a contingent basis the antelope creek project for the fourstate missouri river mitigation project and particularly for helping the taxpayer by the coordination of flood control and highway construction related to the sand creek reservoir it is an outstanding opportunity to coordinate this it was timeurgent and therefore very much appreciated that this legislation was moved forward i urge my colleagues to strongly support this legislation this member is especially appreciative that he has had the opportunity in the 106th congress to serve on the transportation committee and the water resources and environment subcommittee clearly it has been one of the highlights of the 106th congress for this member this important legislation presents a tremendous opportunity to improve flood control navigation shore protection and environmental protection this member is pleased that the bill we are considering today includes contingent approval for the sand creek watershed project in saunders county nebraska this proposed project which is a result of the lower platte river and tributaries flood control study is designed to meet federal environmental restoration goals help provide state recreation needs solve local flooding problems and preserve water quality it is sponsored jointly by the lower platte north nrd the city of wahoo and saunders county the plans for the project include a nearly 640acre reservoir known as lake wanahoo wetlands restoration and seven upstream sediment nutrient traps the sand creek watershed project would result in important environmental and recreational benefits for the area and has attracted widespread support it is especially crucial that the sand creek project is included in wrda this year as the nebraska department of roads is ready to begin design of a freeway in that area that will be routed across the top of a dam if the project is approved if the sand creek project is not included in wrda a new bridge will have to be planned and built which would make the project not economically feasible with this authorization contingent because of facts yet to be checked and planning study elements yet to be resolved the way is clear to save the taxpayers funds secure mutual project benefits in highway construction and flood control this member is also very pleased that contingent authorization of the antelope creek project is included in wrda 2000 antelope creek runs through the heart of nebraskas capital city of lincoln the purpose of the project is to solve multifaceted problems involving the flood control and drainage problems in antelope creek as well as existing transportation and safety problems all within the context of broad land use issues this member continues to have a strong interest in this project since he was responsible for stimulating the city of lincoln the lower platte south natural resources district and the university of nebraskalincoln to work jointly and cooperatively with the army corps of engineers to identify an effective flood control system for antelope creek in the downtown area of lincoln antelope creek which was originally a small meandering stream became a straightened urban drainage channel as lincoln grew and urbanized resulting erosion has deepened and widened the channel and created an unstable situation a tenfootbytwentyfoot height and width closed underground conduit that was constructed between 1911 and 1916 now requires significant maintenance and major rehabilitation a dangerous flood threat to adjacent public and private facilities exists the goals of the project are to construct a flood overflow conveyance channel which would narrow the flood plain from up to seven blocks wide to the 150foot wide channel the project will include trails and bridges and improve bikeway and pedestrian systems another nebraska project was included on the contingent authorization list is for western sarpy and clear creek for flood damage reduction frankly this member must say he has substantial reservations about the clear creek project in light of concerns expressed by constituents in adjacent saunders county and the lack of enthusiasm by relevant state officials this member reserves judgment whether the benefits outweigh costs and dislocation of property owners in the area this member is pleased that at least part of the language regarding the missouri river valley improvement act that he originally prepared to be offered as an amendment during subcommittee consideration of wrda is included in todays bill last years wrda legislation included a provision this member promoted hich helps to ensure that the missouri river mitigation project can be implemented as envisioned in 1986 congress authorized over 50 million more than 79 million in todays dollars if adjusted for inflation to fund the missouri river mitigation project to restore fish and wildlife habitat that were lost due to the construction of structures to implement the picksloan plan at that time the corps did not choose to include funding requests for implementing that act in their budgeting process that is why this member with assistance from other members who represent the four states bordering the channelized missouri river nebraska iowa kansas and missouri has taken the lead in providing funding to implement the missouri river mitigation project which has just begun to become a reality during the last few years this project is specifically needed to restore fish and wildlife habitat lost due to the federally sponsored channelization and stabilization projects of the picksloan era the islands wetlands and flat floodplains that are needed to support the wildlife and waterfowl that once lived along the river are dramatically reduced an estimated 475 000 acres of habitat in iowa nebraska missouri and kansas have been lost because of federal action in creating the flood control projects and channelization of the missouri river todays fishery resources are estimated to be only onefifth of those which existed in predevelopment days the success of the project has resulted in a concern related to the original study that outlined habitat needs under this study acreage goals for each state were listed and these goals are generally considered to be an acreage limitation for each state nebraska and kansas have already reached their acreage limits and missouri is fast approaching its ceiling before long iowa will also reach its acreage limit to correct this problem the wrda legislation enacted last year authorized provisions initiated by this member to increase mitigation lands in the four states of 25 of the lands lost or 118 650 acres in addition the corps of engineers in conjunction with the four stateswas directed to study the amount of funds that would need to be authorized to achieve that acreage goal the study has been completed and it appears that cost estimates for restoring the acreage authorized in last years wrda will amount to more than 700 million over the next 3035 years this member greatly appreciates the inclusion of an increased authorization level of funding for the missouri river mitigation project of 20 000 000 for each fiscal year from fy2001 through fy2010 this increase would allow the project to better balance the needs of nature recreation and navigation it will also benefit communities preparing for the bicentennial of the lewis and clark expedition beginning in 2003 until funding authorization is increased the corps and the states cannot finalize plans to add habitat restoration identify and prioritize sites for restoration respond to willing sellers or engage in construction or maintenance activities it is important to note that many frequently flooded landowners along the missouri river have asked the corps to buy their land to avoid annual flood losses however in most years the corps has had insufficient funds to meet the needs of these struggling landowners finally the wrda bill also includes legislative language initiated by this member to authorize a pilot program to test the designbuild method of project delivery on a maximum of five civil engineering projects such a program will provide significant benefits and yield useful information in closing this member urges his colleagues to support this important bill in the short time left in the 106th congress we must work to ensure wrda becomes law this year"]]}
