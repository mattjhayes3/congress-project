mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for

for being here this is an important issue there is no question about that we are here because we are outraged we are outraged at republican attempts to undermine our child nutrition programs we are outraged at their lousy child reauthorization bill it is a terrible terrible terrible bill my friends should be ashamed of this bill a nutritious school meal is just as important to a childs success in school as a textbook hungry children cant concentrate they cant focus on their studies in short hungry children cannot learn that is a fact everybody knows that yet we have a bill that my republican friends have drafted that will increase hunger and that will actually take food out of the mouths of children it is outrageous together our child nutrition programs wic school breakfast and lunch the summer food service program and the child and adult care food program provide nutritional support for children year round in places where they live learn and play unfortunately h r 5003 which is the republican reauthorization bill includes a number of harmful provisions that would roll back years of progress and hamper the ability of children to access healthy meals as i said to be very blunt it makes hunger worse in this country specifically the bill would undermine the successful community eligibility provision which some of my colleagues have talked about first included in the last reauthorization bill that has allowed highpoverty school districts to offer universal school meals to all students in its first 2 years cep helped more than 8 5 million lowincome students access free meals instead of building on the success of this program my republican friends would severely restrict schools eligibility for the community eligibility option the center on budget and policy priorities estimates that 7 022 schools currently using community eligibility would lose it under this republican bill and another 11 647 schools that qualify for community eligibility but who have not yet adopted it would be prevented from doing so in the future as we approach the summer months it is also important to remember that child hunger gets worse in the summer consider this for every six children who get a lunch in school each day only one receives a meal in the summertime instead of being a carefree time for children who depend on getting healthy reliable meals during the school year the summer months can be a time of stress anxiety and hunger but it doesnt have to be this way unfortunately this republican bill cuts the successful summer ebt pilot program which provides a temporary boost in food assistance benefits during the summer months for families whose children receive free school meals during the school year and it fails to make necessary investments to expand the reach of summer food service programs so that more kids have access to healthy summer meals in their neighborhoods in addition this bill rolls back as my colleagues have mentioned evidencebased standards that make school meals healthier usda estimates that more than 90 percent of schools have successfullyhave successfullyimplemented these standards my grandmother used to say to me when i was growing up that an apple a day keeps the doctor away i wish she was still alive so i could tell her she was right food is medicine when we eat good food we eat nutritious food we tend to have healthy lives if you eat bad food if you eat junk food then you end up getting health issues like diabetes like high blood pressure and like obesity i could go on and on and on why in the world would anybody want to lower the nutrition standards in our school meals to give our kids junkier less nutritious food what sense does that make if my colleagues who are advocating these reversals of smart policy are doing so only because they want to save a few dollars then let me tell you something you are saving nothing if we dont get this right if we dont insist that our kids have access to nutritious healthier food the medical costs associated with the health challenges that they will experience are astronomical as my colleague from wisconsin mentioned earlier hundreds of billions of dollars in avoidable healthcare costs as a result of children not having access to good food 15 million children face hunger in this country instead of undoing the success we have already achieved congress should be focused on ways we can strengthen these vital child nutrition programs let me say finally it is hard for me to understand why we have to be here today why everything is a fight when it comes to dealing with issues of hunger and when it comes to dealing with issues and making sure our kids get access to good nutrition it is always a fight it is always a fight to protect so many vital food and nutrition programs that help our kids there is either a shocking ignorance about the reality of the poverty that millions of our children face in this country or there is simply indifference those are the only two ways i can explain what is going on in this chamber whichever one it is it is a sad excuse for what my republican friends are trying to do lets come together this should be a bipartisan issue there was a time when fighting hunger and when making sure that our kids had access to nutritious food was a bipartisan issue george mcgovern and bob dole worked together in the 1970s to strengthen our food and nutrition programs but now in this chamber these issues have become controversial it is sad because there are a lot of people in this country who are depending on us to find ways to end hunger in america they are depending on us to make sure that their kids when they go to school have access to nutritious food and that they have access to nutritious food during the summer months as well why are my friends making it so difficult enough enough of this stop beating up on the most vulnerable people in this country lets come together lets reject this awful

them as it relates to background checks the proposals focus on new background check requirements that will enhance the effectiveness of the national instant criminal background check system the nics and the greater education and enforcement efforts of existing laws at the state level specifically it directs the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives to require any business that engages in the sale of guns to obtain a federal license to do so and to conduct background checks it calls for the increased funding for the atf in the hiring of 200 new atf agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws and it requires the atf to issue a rule requiring background checks for the purchasers who purchase certain dangerous firearms and other items through a trust a corporation or other legal entity it encourages greater communication between federal and state authorities on criminal history information what could be wrong with that that is within the boundary of our laws within our constitutional rights and it makes our nation safer i come to this floor today as one who considers herself to be a victim of gun violence we need to confront this right away because for

that took place in the new york city councils chambers i am not alone there are millions of americans who are witnesses to gun violence or who may have been maimed by gun violence and who did not necessarily die as a result of it but whose lives have been changed dramatically we should not have another generation of americans who can speak to the unspeakable horror of what it is to either be impacted directly in the loss of a loved one or to be the families who have to recount the times when they have had to be at the hospital with someone who is trying to recover from being gunned down

do with combating zika in fact republicans have been pushing the text of the underlying legislation for years under whatever name happens to be convenient at the time otherwise known as the pesticide trojan horse bill this legislation attempts to gut our ability to track and report when and where harmful pesticides are sprayed without oversight compliance physicians and scientists are less able to track and identify the cluster of symptoms caused by pesticides which in turn reduces their ability to protect the publics health i know as a physician and public health expert that pesticides can have serious toxic impacts on human health particularly for women and children pesticides can endanger women and unborn children cause malformation in infants hinder early childhood development endanger reproductive health and cause cancer i speak as a physician but i also speak as the son of farm workers the underlying bill could expose already vulnerable populations to greater risks of

i hope we can continue in accordance with the budget the provisions crafted by the committee on ways and means targets the foundational pieces of the presidents healthcare law including repealing tax hikes totaling over 100 billion that slow our economy the president may very well veto this bill locking millions of americans into a healthcare law they dont want and giving taxpayer dollars to controversial and unethical practices at planned parenthood but if he does he will have to explain to the american people his support of all this including tax increases and mandates in the name of a law that has increased healthcare costs raided medicare and forced millions onto an already broken medicaid system i want to hear those answers from the president and the american public wants to hear those answers i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.9999927282333374, 0.9999927282333374, 0, "it has been quite an eventful week we have taken up many things and i couldnt be more proud of my friend from texas chairman thornberry he has done tremendous work on the national defense authorization and is to be applauded for trying to prevent the military from being weakened further than the sequester has already made it one of the bills that we took up and passed today was the iran nuclear agreement review act and i am anal enough i will get these bills and read them so that is what i did amazingly the first paragraphof course this bill came to us from the senate as the iran nuclear agreement review act and many of us had concerns about it but i didnt realize that the actual title of the iran nuclear agreement review act wasand this is the opening paragraph of the bill resolved that the bill from the house of representatives h r 1191 entitled an act to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to ensure that emergency services volunteers are not taken into account as employees under the shared responsibility requirements contained in the patient protection and affordable care act do pass with the following that is what it is it is an irs bill to adjust the affordable care act and it is hard for me to use those words affordable care act because it is anything but affordable it has cost people their insurance their doctors their health their health insurance it is laughable to call it affordable nonetheless this is a bill to attempt to amend the affordable care act and you might wonder wait a minute i thought you said this was the iran nuclear agreement review actwell exactly it is an irs bill to fix this exception for emergency services volunteers that they not be considered under the affordable care act then we go to the senate bill this is like the affordable care act because they take a house bill that is intended for one purpose delete beginning with line 1 page 1 delete everything in it and then make it the iran nuclear review acttalk about democracy in action really impressive they strip out everything to do with making the obamacare bill better and instead replace it with the iran nuclear review act there were a few dozen of us that had major concerns about it first of all we had already heard that this bill was going to turn the constitution upside down the constitutional requirements for a treatywhat is a treaty it is an agreement between one country and another the president has authority to negotiate those agreements then under the constitution if we still care about the constitution then that treaty has to go before the senate and get twothirds of the votes of the senators otherwise that treaty means nothing and it is not binding it doesnt matter what the president or the executive branch or the secretary of state call that agreement that treaty it is a treaty between one country and another for purposes of the constitution it should go before the senate for ratification but congress has gotten so used to this president just ignoring it so used to the justice department saying we dont care what you are requesting we are not going to give you any of those documents or any of the information we have gotten so used to that we said okay we will pass a bill that will force the administration to let congress know what is going on even though we are going to flip the constitution upside down and go from requiring as the constitution does a vote of 67 senators in order to ratify a treaty or agreement with a foreign country and we are going to go with requiring 67 senators to vote it down completely reversing the constitutional requirement but we will make it better because we will add a requirement that the house has to have twothirds vote get 290 votes to vote it down but at least this way congress gets to be a player and gets to know what is going on what is it that is in this bill that will teach the executive branch a lesson about why you dont mess with congress it is in here and it is actually at page 8 it is entitlednumber 5 on page 8 limitation on actions during congressional reconsideration of a joint resolution of disapproval so here we are the president supposedly under this bill will send the agreement that he wants congress to see kind of like the trade act that they classified and we hadnt gotten all of it but we are going to vote on it anyway it makes no sense but for those of us that are anal enough to want to read these things before we pass them this has got to have enough teeth that it will teach the president a lesson if he dares to betray us and not give us what we need in order to make a proper determination the structure is both the house and senate under this bill this affordable care act billnow iran nuclear review actwe get the chance to strike that down if we can come up with twothirds votes in both the house and the senate what happens what is the meat what is the real teeth in this bill that will teach the president and the entire state department a lesson if they mess with us and we vote in the house and the senate twothirds to disapprove it well here it is if a joint resolution of disapproval passes both houses of congress and the president vetoes such joint resolutionwow people forgot that even though we are going to give ourselves the opportunity to vote with twothirds to strike it down if he vetoes that here is the real punishing aspect for the president who many of us believe has been violating the law by loosening sanctions that were put in place by congress you are not supposed to be able to change the law unilaterally when congress and another president has passed and signed law into being but the sanctions are there duly passed signed into law well this says here it is this will teach him a lesson if the disapproval passes both houses of congress and the president vetoes such joint resolutionhere it is the president may not waive suspend reduce provide relief from or otherwise limit the application of statutory sanctions with respect to iran under any provision of law or refrain from applying any such sanctions pursuant to an agreement described in subsection a here it isfor a period of 10 days if the president has been violating the law as some of us believe by lifting sanctions that he doesnt have authority to lift and we come along and the house and senate disapprove the treaty with iran and he vetoes that treatyhere is the lessonhe cant illegally lift sanctions against iran for 10 whole days10 calendar days it says 10 calendar days man that is going to teach him a lesson this is a powerful bill that will teach the president that you dont mess with congress if you loosen the sanctions that the law put in place why we will pass another bill that says you cant do it for 10 whole days and that is what we did here now on page 9 we have got the effect of congressional action with respect to nuclear agreements with iran it is a sense of congress b says it is a sense of congress that these negotiations are a critically important matter of national security and foreign policy for the united states and its closest allies then c this section does not require a vote by congress for the agreement to commence that is helpful anyway that these negotiations are a critically important matter of national security and foreign policy for the united states and its closest allies is interesting i dont really agree with that because the way i see this agreement is it has been drug out for months and apparently for years i know friends at judicial watch have tried to get what are supposed to be public documentsthose are the travel logs for valerie jarrettso we can find out when she first started flying over to iran to start negotiations and open up the dialogue with iran it would be nice to know most of us on both sides of the aisle staunchly agree that israel is a very dear friend and ally what this negotiation has meant is thatand israel understands thisif president obama and john kerry and wendy sherman who is the lady who gave north korea nukes are negotiating with iran and are telling the world oh we have got a deal we are nearly at a deal we have almost got one worked out and iran is saying we have got no deal we havent agreed to any of that that is not true then it doesnt matter what iran is saying if the united states leaders are saying we are getting close to a deal and we have almost got a deal if israel does the right thing by israel and attacks irans nuclear capability and takes it out as best they can without our best bunker buster and without our best planes to deliver itthey would probably need two or three sorties to take out fourif they actually do the selfdefense process of hitting iran then this administration would be able to unite the world against israelcall them warmongers call them all kinds of thingsbecause oh gee we almost had a deal with iran yes they have been dragging this out for 2 years or so but we nearly had a deal oh dont pay any attention to irans saying we didnt have a deal we were so close to having a deal therefore israel is a bunch of warmongers therefore the whole world and the u n should punish them that is what israel i believe understands that this deal means regardless of whether a deal is ever reached and i wouldnt put it past this administration to agree to keep dragging it out and dragging it out for the rest of this presidents administration it is certainly in irans interests because they are continuing to enrich uranium and nothing has slowed them down as we know now they are not even letting anybody at the iaea examine all of their facilities forget the openness that this administration says they are going to get i think the bottom line of this bill that we passed today and that the senate passed also is that we are going to ignore the presidents and the executive branchs illegal actions in lifting the sanctions they are not entitled to lift if he will be kind enough to allow congress to think about the sanctions some more and if he will give us information on how things are going in iran i mean there is a requirement here for 30 days within which they have got to give us notice unless they think that is not enough time and then they would give us 60days notice they have to give us a semiannual report every 6 months we will find out what is going on the thing that concerns me of courseone of many thingsis that i have been asking for the documents that the justice department gave to people who were convicted of supporting terrorism in the holy land foundation trial the conviction occurred in november 2008 as part of the discovery in that prosecution they were given massive numbers of documents from the fbi and from the justice department that they had obtained about radical islam here in the united states they gave it to the convicted terrorists we now know they are convicted of supporting terrorism and they got all of those documents when eric holder tells me in a hearing basically that there may be some classification issues you gave them to terrorists for heavens sake dont you think you can afford to give them to members of congress so we can see what the evidence was that you had for heavens sake they have not given us the information on that they have obfuscated about the fast and furious evidence they have covered up evidence in the administration about the irs conspiracy to prevent conservative groups from raising money like the liberal groups were so that the republicans would have a better chance in the 2012 election now this bill says we havent been able to trust them on any of these other things but we are going to trust them on this we are going to trust iran to let us have a full review of everything they are doing even though they have never done that before and we are going to trust this administration for the first time in 61 2 years to start giving us full information about what is going on some might think that is a little foolhardy and i would be one of those here at the bottom of page 17 if the president in his own determination decides he is able to make the certification required then he will do that nice real nice page 18 is another sense of congress the united states sanctions on iran for terrorism human rights abuses and ballistic missiles will remain in place under an agreement of course that is unless the president wants to ignore this like he has been ignoring the sanctions already but you cant forget that language on page 8 by golly if he vetoes a bill disapproving and if he cant lift sanctions he has got to quit doing that illegal stuff for 10 full days now it does say at the bottom of page 18 the president should determine the agreement in no way compromises the commitment of the united states to israels security it says he should do that but it doesnt say he shall or he must the good news is on page 19 expedited consideration of legislation in the event as it says here the president does not submit a certification with all of the information that is required like he has ignored on lots of other things we have requested or at least the executive branch has then we are going to introduce legislationit says right here within 60 calendar days of his not following the law it is going to go quickly to the house floor and the senate floor that is on page 21 we are going to get it to the floor quickly page 22 qualifying legislation shall be considered as read so we are going to get here quickly and we are going to waive points of order against whatever legislation it might be it may be that if we really get our spines stiffened and we pass legislation that extends that 10day period where he cant lift sanctions like he has been doing maybe we will extend that to 20 days and really show him that he cant mess with congress yes for the liberals who might someday read the transcript of this i am being sarcastic liberals have trouble understanding sarcasm sometimes but this is a very very deadly serious issue iran has shown they cant be trusted about anything the ayatollah cannot be trusted for heavens sake jimmy carter decided the other ayatollahthe first ayatollah khomeiniwas a man of peace he welcomed him for the first time in a century or sowell not quite a centuryto let a radical islamist take over a countrys military and as a result americans have died in the last 35 years 36 years and i am afraid more will it is ridiculous to play footsie with iran they only know one thing and that is power i read the statements by one of the iranian military leaders who said they welcome war with america and it clicked i remember somebody in the saddam hussein regime saying the same thing and that if we tried to do anything it would be the mother of all wars it was amazing because we moved faster and further than any military has ever moved in the history of the world mistakes were made absolutely but the american military could put iran in its place very quicklyand shouldbefore they get nuclear weapons and hundreds or thousands or millions of people die there is one thing i want to mention before time runs out we took up this week the usa freedom act actually there are some very good things in here again i just felt i have to read the bill sorry if that bothers some of my friends for example one of the things that was heralded as a great accomplishment we found out from snowden that the fisa courts had just not really issued constitutional orders or warrantsno specificityjust an order saying for example verizon give the government every record on every caller you have in your records give it all to the government i would submit that is unconstitutional and when we found out the fisa court did it it was outrageous to me that is not probable caution that is not specificity there are all kinds of problems there and this bill was going to try to address that on page 35 one of the things that was heralded wasand it is a good ideato create amicus curiae which is a group of lawyers who will represent those people who have records that are being sought even though those people dont know that their records are being sought it says in title iv section 401 that the judges shall designate not fewer than five individuals to be eligible to serve as amicus curiaeor friends of the courtto represent those interests the trouble isit says down here at the bottom of page 35that the court shall appoint these lawyers and individuals who serve as amicus curiae to assist in any application if in the opinion of the court the government is presenting a novel or a significant interpretation of the law that means they are not going to be there to protect the civil rights of people whose records are being obtained as they were under the fisa orders previously unconstitutionally because the court can just decide no this is not a novel interpretation so we are not going to take it up then even if it is a novel or a significant interpretation it says unless the court issues a written finding that such appropriation is not appropriate if you just look over at page 40 it tells you the government can discuss on an ex parte basisthat is without the other sides being presentto the court so they can tell the court we dont want the amicus curiae here on this issue that is just one of so many major major loopholes we found out in the summer of 2007 there were perhaps 3 000 cases with the national security lettersthe ig determined thiswhere fbi agents just sent out national security letters demanding records there was no case there was no probable cause and it was a crime if the people from whom the records were sought revealed that to friends we thought that would be tightened up a little bit it still says in here that the only people who can authorize what basically is a warrant is the fbi director himself or herself or he can designate his deputy but nobody lower than that other than any special agent in charge anywhere in the country which was the problem that we ran into in 2007 with all of the abuses there is still a lot of reason not to feel comfortable that peoples rights are going to be protected in the fisa courts i am not comfortable with the fisa courts anymore but i appreciate the time to point this out i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.9999661445617676,

legislative threat to the safety and wellbeing of the american people we dodged a bullet in the last session of congress about this very same issue that i will be discussing this evening but today again we are in serious jeopardy of having an important right of the american people neutered from them taken away from them by a power play here in washington d c being conducted by multinational corporations who have done everything they can to impact on this system while the american people do not know that there is an attempted move against their constitutional rights alerted by an aggressive yet an unsuccessful attempt to stop this rigorous and rancorous legislation in the house the senate was inundated last year about a similar bill that was supposed to be reform and it was very similar to the one that i will be discussing today there was so much opposition to that bill in the senate that they simply refused to bring it up to the floor for consideration the bill had already passed the house and as i say today a similar bill now is making its way through the house and will be on the floor and it is a great threat to the freedom security and wellbeing of the american people what was that issue that was rammed through the house and once it was exposed that the senate turned it back well it has been an ongoing fight over 20 years a classic case of crony capitalism that plagues our country the big guys are trying to diminish the rights of the little guys in order to make more moneysurprise surprise in this case however what we are talking about they will not only make more money and take that from the little guys but it will undermine americas prosperity and security in the long run i am certainly not opposed to the profit motive but first and foremost we need to ensure that powerful forces dont change the economic rules in order to enrich themselves unseen by most americans who are not paying attention but are paying attention to the important things in their lives their children their families their jobs their schools and their churches but they have been basically unaware that there is an attempt by megamultinational corporations to undermine and yes destroy a constitutional right of our citizensthis in order to fill their pockets at the expense of the american people who dont really understand and even know this power play is going on i am referring to an attack on the fundamental constitutional right of the american people to own what they have created this is a right that has been written into the law at the constitutional conventionit is in our constitutionthat is under attack in a clandestine legal maneuver that would neuter americas inventors the protection that they were granted by the constitution and permit powerful multinational corporations to steal what rightfully belongs to american inventors as granted to them as a right in the constitution thus ordinary americans of course are not as able to get their voices heard at times here in congress and big corporations are they have whole stables of lobbyists tonight we need to mobilize the american people and have them make sure that they contact their member of congress i will alert my fellow colleagues to make sure that they pay attention to what is happening in this piece of legislation that is now being rammed through congress it isnt just about of course dispossessing this issue isnt just dispossessing individual inventors it is a power grab that if they are successful in undermining the constitutional rights of inventors to own for a given period of time what they have created this change in our constitutional law will undermine the prosperity that we have enjoyed as americans the less than forthright attack on our patent system will undermine the economic wellbeing of our working people who depend on the united states to be technologically superior in order so that they can outcompete other peoples in other countries who come from poor societies who work just as hard but dont have the technological advantage that we americans have the american working people have always had the advantage that they can be more productive because our country permitted the technological development of the means of production that made our workers the most productive in the world people are working hard all over the world but it was the people of the united states who coupled that with freedom and coupled that with technology and it uplifted everyone our founding fathers believed that technology freedom and yes the profit motive was the formula that would uplift humankind they wrote into our constitution a guarantee of the property rights of inventors and authors it is the only place in the body of our constitution where the word right is used in article i section 8 clause 8 of the constitution of the united states the congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries this provision has served america well it has led to a general prosperity and national security and it has permitted average people in our country to live decent lives and to have good jobs but instead now we are putting all of that at risk because some multinational corporations want to steal the technology that has been developed by our little guys our small inventors our small and independent inventors are where the new ideas come from these big meganational corporations have huge bureaucracies that are not the source of the great discoveries that we have had over the last two centuries americans work hard as i say but so do all the other people in the world it is technology that makes the difference our technology has multiplied results of that hard work yes that is the secret of our success technology and freedom that was put in place not just because we talk about it but because we wrote that into our law our basic fundamental law the constitution and we have developed from that moment the strongest patent system in the world and that is what has made all the difference benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson were men who believed in technology believed in liberty and freedom and believed that we could uplift every human being not just the elite in our society thus they made sure that in our constitution we had this provision that we set our course toward uplifting all people through technology hard work freedom and the profit motive yet today multinational corporations run by americansand maybe by some multinational corporations that just have americans working for themwant to diminish the patent protection our founding fathers put in place want to diminish the patent protection that has served us so well and over the years we fought and turned back several efforts to weaken the patent system the american people are unaware of this they are unaware that for the last 20 years there has been this attemptand they call it harmonizing our patent system with the rest of the world when we have the strongest system and they were trying to weaken it how does the rest of the world respect the rights of the little guy they dont in fact our patent system has said that if a man or a womanan inventorapplies for a patent overseas that after 18 months anybody who applies for a patent over there has a different situation than our patent applicants an inventor who applies for a patent in the united states knows that his patent application will be totally confidential until the moment he is issued the patent when that patent is issued then it can be published but he then has the legal power to protect his patent rights for a given period of time traditionally that has been 17 years of guaranteed protection well that is not the way the rest of the world works the rest of the world wants 18 months eighteen months after you apply for a patent they publish it for the whole world to see even if the patent has not been issued thus any inventor in that case everything that he or she has invented and all of the research is now made available to ones competitors that destroys incentive and in fact that was the goal 20 years ago that marcy kaptur of ohio and i were able to stop that provision from being put in the law because of what they were trying to do in harmonizing this law was that every american todaythink about itevery american inventor today anybody who didnt get their patent in 18 months it would be published to the world and we would have a massive stealing of our technology and undercutting of our technological superiority i might add the other thing they were trying to accomplish was they saidand overseas they dont have this guaranteeand that is if you apply for a patent if it takes you 10 years to get your patent you still have 17 years of guaranteed patent protection from the time it is issued overseas they start the clock ticking at 20 years when you file if you file for a patent and it takes you lets say 10 years to get your patent in the united states you would have 17 years of protection overseas you end up with 10 sometimes 5 years of protection we have the strongest system in the world it has worked for us now we have people over the last 20 years who have tried everything they could to undermine it we won those early fights against the two provisions i just described well after a few years of this of course marcy kaptur a strong coalition and i managed to thwart those efforts but today we see anotheranothereffort to try to undermine and diminish the patent protection that we have been fighting to preserve for these last 20 years 31 2 years ago the house passed the america invents act which we warned fundamentally diminished the patent system weakening its protection for ordinary citizens the negative impact of that billand that is just 31 2 years agothe negative impact is overwhelming we changed for example the fundamental idea in that bill one of the ideas that was changed from our countrys founding it was always the first person to invent something and can prove they invented it they will get the patent well they have changed it to the first not to invent they changed that to the first one to file for a patent is going to get the patent so that smaller and independent inventors who cant afford to go over and over again and every new twist of their invention get a separate patent for these small inventors have been facing major corporations that then immediately will go in and file for patent after patent after patent because they can afford it what they have done now is these corporations are flooding the patent office with applications of course there are not more people working in the patent office thus they are feeling a dramatic reduction in their ability to get the job done because they are being flooded with patent application because we have changed the basic rules of the game and it has worked against technological development in our country the onslaught as i said of course is aimed at neutering the rights of the small inventor we have barely turned back this latest attempt which last year we passed through the house and went to the senate but when the senators of course got a message from their own colleges and universities as to what this would do and the damage that it would do to the universities we were able to stop it and stop the effort in the senate now we have the american innovation act that has been presented here this is yet the most recent onslaught over a 20year battle of trying to protect the interests of the little guy now we have the american innovation act let me just suggest that these big megacorporations over the years who have stepped up with these proposals that would diminish the right of the small inventor didnt say we are trying to diminish the rights of the small inventor that is not what was being sold to the members of congress instead what was sold in the first onslaught 20 years ago was the submarine patent that is why we have got to eliminate the ability for people to have a patent application that is secret until it is granted that is why at 20 years from filing you dont have any more patent protection well that was a derogatory term that was used to confuse the public in order to try to secure their goal of diminishing the right of all inventors especially small inventors they are insisting of course now that there is another threat and that we should pay attention to this other threat that has emerged that should motivate us to again diminish the rights of american inventors to protect their own patent because supposedly patent law is being abused by the socalled patent trolls now what are patent trolls let me note that we all understand that there are frivolous lawsuits that take place throughout the american system we have a system of justice you can sue someone if that person has damaged you yet there are frivolous lawsuits lawyers will do that and we know that that is something we have got to deal with judges need to be stronger in that case but they exist and yes there are frivolous lawsuits that are presented by lawyers over patent right infringement and sometimes these frivolous lawsuitsand many timesare just based on phony claims that they claim they have the right in the patent to this and they sue some businessman hoping he will just pay off that is indeed a problem it is not a major problem in the sense that it is a minor part of all of the litigation that goes on almost all the patent litigation that goes on and most of the lawyers who are involved in this who are called patent trolls are involved with legitimate claims against people who have infringed on the patent rights of especially small inventors they are basically getting involved with the small inventor who does not have the resources to basically defend his patent against some large megamultinational corporation but of course big corporations would have us believe that what we are really talking about are frivolous lawsuits against them no there are many many positive lawsuits that are totally justified the vast majority of all lawsuits that come into play against these major corporations are based on a legitimate claim by someone who owns a legitimate patent who these big companies have just tried to rip off and so what they are trying to do now is what they are trying to make it more difficult for those little guys even with any type of help from what they call a patent troll to be able to actually bring their case of infringement against large corporations what this basically is saying is we have got to change our justice system we have got to change the rules of the game for every lawsuit because some people have been manipulating the law and having frivolous lawsuits i dont think that that is what we want in america we dont want to take away the right the legitimate right to go and defend yourself in court because some people use the courts in a frivolous or a manipulative manner if the small inventor doesnt have the resources for example to enforce his or her own patent and if they have been granted this patent legitimately by the federal government that they own this technology that they have developed then there is nothing wrong with the fact that someone could come along and help them enforce it when a megamultinational corporation is basically stealing their rights i have consulted with a number of outside individual inventors and groups they have affirmed to me that the legislation now being proposed in h r 9 the bill that was already passed through the judiciary committee that that bill disadvantages the little guy against deeppocketed corporations and in fact every provision in the name of stopping patent trolls is a provision that would undermine the efforts of people who own legitimate patents and have legitimate patent claims and undermine their ability to enforce those claims so basically we are saying and what is being said about patent trolls yes there are frivolous lawsuits and trolls sometimes are involved with frivolous lawsuits but by and large that does not mean that the overwhelming number of lawsuits are not legitimate and they should have every right to call on someone to help them in their effort basically to defend their patent rights proponents of this legislation are covering the fact that what we really have here is a bill on h r 9 that makes it easier for big corporations to steal the technology secrets of the little guys they would have us believe that all lawsuits are frivolous and the frivolous lawsuits are throughout our system and instead of focusing just on frivolous lawsuits they want us to have an overall diminishing of the rights to our inventors to enforce their patents and make it more difficult for them to do so so tonight i draw the attention of the american people to h r 9 the innovation act as i say was introduced by chairman goodlatte and was passed through just a week ago or 2 weeks ago in the judiciary committee in the last congress the house judiciary committee held hearings on this bill and witnesses at that hearing included director kappos and others that was when we were discussing the america invents act and people said lets go slow on this why are we trying to push this through in such a hurried manner well they are trying to push it through in a hurried manner because once people understand the implications of diminishing the right of people to protect their patents they are going to find it has dramatic changes to the american way of life for example our universities now have discovered that if indeed h r 9 passes that it will have a huge impact on the viability of their own scientific research and their own patents that they own by these various universities it will diminish the value of patents across the board if we say that it is going to be more difficult to fight infringers and more costly for someone to fight someone who is infringing on that patent so according to sponsors of h r 9 this is as i say an attempt to control the trolls but in fact it is going to control the universities it is going to control other companies other than these big companies that as i say are multinational companies they are mainly in the electronics industry those people may want to take away some of these patent rights and let them sue but that is not true in many others you have got pharmaceuticals and biotech and many other industries that will be impacted in a horrible way because of h r 9 now what we need to do is make sure that the american people speak to their member of congress and talk to them about we do not want to make it more difficult for people who have developed new technologies to defend their technologies against infringers we dont want to make it more difficult for people who are the innovators to innovate to come up with the new ideas to basically make sure that america is on the cutting edge and leading the way and if we have harmonized with the rest of the world as has been their goal for a long timeand i might add one of the things that we have to be very concerned about when we look at the trade bill that is being shoved through congress is whether or not it will contain a provision that i helped defeat 20 years ago which i just mentioned that will make sure that our patent applications are published after 18 months now i have been told that that is in the trade bill and there have been all sorts of denials and some people are coming to me whispering yes it is in there well we know we are operating under secrecy we have been operating under secrecy here so it is impossible for me to tell the public i know absolutely because i read it because had i read about this in that bill i wouldnt be permitted to talk about it but that is another one of those things that you have got to be very careful what are you going to pass in this trade bill it might be exactly what i am talking about which is a diminishing of the patent rights of the little guy and who is pushing that megacorporations multinational corporations the same guys who are pushing this trade bill on us and not letting us even know what is in the trade bill which we are supposed to give up our right for an upordown vote not even knowing what is in that bill so what we need to do is make sure we go through all of those items in this bill h r 9 and people have to understand that every one of those provisions in this bill are aimed at making it more difficult for the small inventor to go up against a major corporation who is infringing on that inventors creation so how come we have got bills now that we can be bringing to the floor and that are aimed at helping the big guy steal from the little guy this is not what america is all about this isnt what our founding fathers had in mind the results of h r 9 will be increased patent infringement meaning the little guys will have more and more of what they are developing stolen from them and thus there will be less incentive for the geniuses in our society to use that genius to create the new technologies that keep us safesafe it is our technological edge that keeps us safe that makes us prosperous we cant be prosperous unless we are the innovators unless we are the guys with the new ideas rather than the people who are just copying other people our working people will not have a decent standard of living this will reduce the legal remedies for those who have been infringed upon it will reduce investment into small businesses that are aimed at technological development why would anybody want to invest with a small inventor or a small company that is developing technology if you are going to make it more and more difficult for that investor to get that money back if someone is stealing that technology and of course it will do irreparable damage to our research universities our inventors our entrepreneurs our economy and our nation every part of the socalled reform is detrimental to the patent owners and especially individual innovators will be damaged every provision bolsters the patent thieves the infringers at the expense of the legal owners all this done covered by the idea well we have got to get at the trolls i would like to share with you and with my colleagues just the story of exactly how that word troll came up there is a head of a major corporation who changed his mind on this bill who years ago was part of the clique pushing this sort of diminishing of patent rights he told me that he sat in a room with other corporate executives to come up with the strategy how are we going to get the american people to support legislation that actually hurts the little guy and helps the big guy steal from the little guy how are we going to do that well we need a straw man we need something to get attention that is going to make it look like that is really the goal is to take care of that evil sinister person over there they went around the circle trying to come up with a name that was so sinister that would help them accomplish their mission this is how cynical these people are who are offering this argument about trolls and finally the guy who was talking to me said i suggested patent pirate but by the time it got around patent troll sounded so much more sinister they decided they would accept that well this is absolutely absurd the fact is that if we are going to beat this onslaught of the big guys against the little guys we little guys have got to stick together we have got to make sure that we notify our members of congress and talk to other members we have got to pay attention because this is just another example of when we are not paying attention we lose our freedom we lose our freedom our rights are diminished you can count on the fact with the diminished rights of our inventors wages in this country will go down our competitiveness will go down we will not be secure we will not be prosperous this is an important issue yet they are trying to get this by with as little debate and as little attention as possible now how important is this well it has always been important to our country if we didnt have this patent protection that i am talking about our country would be totally different let me suggest this if you look back and see what our founding fathers had in mind they wanted the little guys to be protected and have legal rights this is what our country was all about and the innovation and the rights of ownership this was our innovation this is what benjamin franklin talked about and put into our constitution and that has worked so well for us if we cut off the little guys and if we make sure that they are not going to profit from their hard work and their struggle we will not have the new technologies we will not be the leader in technology in the world and we will fall behind and every one of us will be hurt by this one only needs to see how important technology was to our society one only needs to take a look here in the halls of congress there is a statue here in the capitol of philo farnsworth now who the heck knows who philo farnsworth was they have done a special on him on education tv i understand on the history channel philo farnsworth was someone who really was important to our country and there is a statue to philo farnsworth right here in the capitol he was a farmer in utah a man who was educated in engineering but who had very little resources in fact he was a farmer he set out between farming to try to find out and discover a technological secret that had perplexed some of the most powerful and financial interests in our country rca at that timethis was back at the turn of the century in 1910 and 1920was under a man named david sarnoff he was americas premier executive at the premier technology company of the united states a company that had vast resources and was deeply involved with trying to find out how to invent a picture tube they knew what the radio tube was but they didnt know how to make images on it how could they make that radio tube show images this is what they really were looking for and they had invested so much in it it was a huge challengean historic challengethat rca dumped millions of dollars of research into however they didnt discover it the one who discovered the secret of the picture tubeand it has had so much impact on the american way of life since everything we havecell phones computers you name itis based on a picture tubewas philo farnsworth this independent inventor this farmer from utah discovered the secret he wrote rca naively believing that this big corporation would honor his discovery and permit him to at least have the benefit of being recognized as the person who made this discovery then rca when they got the letter from philo farnsworth sent a representative to the laboratory there in utah which was in his barn i believe when he described to these top engineers from rca what he had found the scientists from rca went away saying oh yes we will be back in touch with you of course they never did get back in touch once they learned of his secret the thing that philo knew was his he ends up reading an announcement in a magazine of how rca had made this major breakthrough this discovery except philo knew he was the one who had discovered it and he was the one who had transmitted that information to rca this became one of the great jury and great legal battles of the 20th century philo farnsworth an individual personnot a wealthy person the little guywas up against the most powerful american corporation of the day rca which had one of the strongest and toughest leaders this corporate leader david sarnoff had a whole stable full of tough wellpaid lawyers all of whom vowed not to give one penny to philo farnsworth and not to recognize him because rca deserved to get the credit and the money philo farnsworth was able to mobilize support behind his claim people invested in philo farnsworths claim and it went all the way to the supreme court he was able to have people invest in his lawsuit slowly but surely they made their way through the court systemas i say all the way to the supreme court god bless the united states of america a poor single manan individual farmercame up against one of the most powerful corporations in america at the time because he had invented something the supreme court decided with philo farnsworth over this brutally powerful corporation in america rca was beaten by an individual farmer but he had people who had invested in him had the same laws they are trying to promote now in h r 9 been in place philo farnsworth and the other little guys who have invented things like this throughout our countrys history would have been betrayed there would have been nothing he could have done because h r 9 would have prevented him from having had people invest in his lawsuit that is what h r 9 does it says if a big corporation has stolen from you and if somebody has invested in helping you with your invention they then become liable if you have to sue to get your money if something happens where the big guys wineven if you are right and they win because they have better lawyersanybody who invests in you has to pay part of the legal fees of these big corporations which are millions of dollars of legal fees no one is going to want to invest in a little guy like that the philo farnsworths would be left out in the cold the nature of our system would have been totally different than what it is today if we were to have had the provisions of h r 9 which they are trying to foist on us now let me give you another example black americans happen to be some of the most inventive people in the united states a lot of people dont know that if you look back in the history of the patent office as i have been looking what you will find is while black americans were being discriminated against in general throughout our whole system the patent office was the one place that they had equal rights to come up with their ideas and to say this is what i have discovered because of that we have many great black inventors maybe that is the reason former chairman of the judiciary committee john conyers is taking my side in this debate on h r 9 he is opposed to that we have a black inventor for example who was the guy who invented the machine that permitted us to mass produce shoes before that time americans had one pair of shoes we started to mass produce them because this black american struggling on his own because he was discriminated against like all black americans were in that day managed to get his patent accepted and he changed not only himself but the whole country had shoes after that isnt that wonderful that is what happens when you have freedom for the little guy and not just for the big guys they come up with the new ideas they can uplift everybody and make sure everybodys feet feel better we are on the verge of losing that now we are on the verge of losing that when i go out in the hallway of congress here i see a statue to philo farnsworth that is where it is it is the statue of this utah farmer who invented the picture tube and who had to take on the biggest company and the biggest corporate powers in the world and he won i will tell you that there is his statue there and that there is no statue to david sarnoff the corporate leader who tried to beat him down and steal his technology i do not care how rich and powerful he was we respect the little guy in this country we want the little guys to be able to have rights that are protected by our constitution that is why our founding fathers put it in the constitution many of these megacorporations especially electronic corporations dont care one bit about the wellbeing of the american people because they are multinational corporations now we want to make sure our people maintain their rights that we keep being the leaders of innovation and that we are able to outcompete the world and not just take all of our jobs overseas and give them to cheap labor we want to make sure that americans benefit because this is what america is all about it is where the little guy has the same rights legally and they are protected that is what this fight is all about when it comes to h r 9 people need to talk to their congressmen and the congressmen need to talk to each other about what this is really all about it is easy to yawn when someone says i am going to discuss patent rights oh yeah patent law how boring it is not boring it is going to make all the difference as to whether our country stays safe because we have to have the technological edge to be safe in the world we are getting into now our people are not going to have decent housing or a decent standard of living because the wealth that is produced isnt produced just by hard work it is produced by technological efficiency and we have to be on the cut ting edge or we will be outcompeted by people overseas this is going to determine what america is going to be like i would ask

new york for the opportunity to share some thoughts here this evening with our leader nancy pelosi and members of the new york delegation as we pay tribute to the life of mario matthew cuomo the greatest of governors in new york and certainly a true statesman a bold and great individual a humble giant and a roaring voice a lion voice for social economic and environmental justice this evening what i recall about the life of mario cuomo is that as i entered the new york state assembly in 1983 that was the same year that he entered into the office of governor and for my first 12 years of service in the new york state assembly it was guided and nurtured and impacted by the strength and the passion of mario cuomo the walk with him and with matilda raffa cuomo as a first couple of new york was a joyous one but a challenging one to pay tribute to the greatness the foundation of family and the passion of immigrants those two guiding dynamics drove the principles the integrity and the message of mario cuomo as a member of his upstate cabinet informing and alerting the governor to various strengths vitalities contributions and history of upstate new york we were able to connect in a very meaningful way the work with him very deliberate and very challenging i will forever be grateful for the learning curve that was developed by working alongside this person of greatness i think also we need to understand that as his son governor andrew cuomo eulogized at his funeral service he made mention very deliberately mario cuomo would not offer render his words of speeches to an audience telling them what they choose to hear but rather what he needed to share that i think speaks to the humble greatness of this individual one who had a vision not only for his state but for his country and for that matter the world i was also touched by the governors sharing about his dad the eloquence of his speech the eloquence of his speaking his public speaking that reached so many people throughout the world he talked about those words and put it into an analogy of a fine bit of jewelry where each word seen as a gem would be deliberately chosen strategically placed and majestically clustered in a way where that array would reach our senses would speak to our senses about what is correct what is socially just and morally sound that is true leadership and it is no wonder through that speech in san francisco that he lit within the minds hearts and souls of americans the best within us how we could assume this level of greatness by understanding that we are at our best when we incorporate in an inclusive set of principles in our world of politics mario cuomo impacted all of us myself included by his reverence for his parents journey as immigrants that journey which was a pathway to freedom that journey which settled into a grocery story a corner grocery store became the pulse of the american dream for his family that was tethered into this country called the united states of america he never forgot that he revered it he was guided by it the light that he brought to his field of politics was immense and it was driven by fairness and inclusion so this evening it is an honor to join with my colleagues to speak to a humble man a great individual who with his wife alongside him matilda brought to this state of new york a sense of hope when there was despair as was said at the funeral he will continue to live his voice may have been silenced but his integrity his spirit and his principles will long live in the lives of those who struggle and

it simply says that the advanced technology vehicle manufacturing loan program will continue to exist but there can be no additional loans the reason that i do so is when i came and offered this amendment last year i had a cutting amendment last year but what was explained to me was that if you cut the program then you wouldnt have money to administer the existing loans that were out there so as a result i have altered this amendment so that it again leaves in place the appropriation which is more than 5 million so that you could continue to administer the existing loans that are in place but there would be no additional loans now why do i think that that is important i think it is important for a couple different reasons i think from a democratic standpoint what we would say is that we all believe in equality and that there shouldnt be subsidized loans for major corporations global corporations here in the united states while your cousins pizza business is struggling or your friends landscaping business is struggling they dont get subsidized loans why should a big business so from a democratic standpoint i think we would hold that belief from a republican standpoint we would say we need to watch out for the taxpayer if you look at the default rate on these loans unfortunately it has been relatively high you would say i dont know if government is in the best spot to be making these kinds of loans to businesses i think that ultimately is the role not of government but of business let them do what they do i think from both vantage points it is something that makes sense i would add just a couple of additional thoughts and then i would yield i would say one there have been only five loans made since 2007 this is not a huge program this is a very limited program two two out of the five loans made since 2007 in fact have defaulted that is a 40 percent default rate i dont think that that is the kind of thing that we would like to see in government there have been no loans made since 2011 and then the gao came in march of 2013 and said the costs outweigh the benefits of this program they followed that up with another gao report in march of 2014 and said we recommend shutting down the program unless the department of energy can show real demand for the loans then they followed that up with a final gao report in march of this year and it said that there hadnt been a sufficient level of demand as a consequence their words were this determining whether funds will be used is important particularly in a constrained fiscal environment this congress should rescind unused appropriations or direct them to other government priorities i think the simple issue with this loan program is that there could be other priorities where you take that 4 billion of

classified status that has been accorded that material so i cant really talk about it i can say that it is very complicated like i say there is probably i am guessing about 8 pounds of document there that you have to read it is largely aspirational in other words i will paraphrase without disclosing any classified information it largely says the parties will aspire or engage to do blah blah blah it is largely unenforceable here is another part of the problem we are negotiating the biggest multinational trade agreement in the history of the united states you have got some countries that i think are reliable partners and that we have a history with canada even before free trade agreements we had trade agreements with canada they have the rule of law there it is not a race to the bottom with canada or with australia or with new zealand i think we have rule of law established in those countries but we also in the same agreement are negotiating with vietnam i went to vietnam not long ago and when we talked issues i sat down across the table from a bunch of communist generals they run the country they have problems with prison labor they have problems with child labor they have serious problems with environmental standards in that country malaysia do you know what the minimum wage in malaysia is zero they do that to try to attract companies the situation in chile and peru we have organizers that have tried to work on behalf of workers who have been killed in those countries there is no rule of law established in those countries where we have had success in enforcing our agreements that has been a major problem so we are going to ask the american worker to compete with workers in vietnam who get i think it is 90 cents an hour 97 cents an houri dont want to sell them short97 cents an hour in a country that has had a history of major problems as i have spoken about malaysia the same thing we cant enforce our agreements and on the issue of who has drafted this bill it is my understanding that the chemical industry provisions in that tpp were drafted by the chemical industry they like it they got exactly what they wanted the same thing with these other industries and again why is it a national secret that i cant talk about a bill that is going to affect every american citizen today and not only that it is going to affect their sons and daughters there is a reason that our kids coming out of college cant get jobs we have got to wake up i told this story before i went to korea recently with jpac it was about the korean war and recovering our sons and daughters who fought in that country and are still there but while i was there i looked for american cars because we had passed a free trade agreement with korea we were there for days i had two young navy lieutenants with me i said lets all look for american cars we saw two american cars in the time we were there in korea it is a big industrial country they have got plenty of traffic we saw hundreds of thousands of cars i saw two american cars the one i was driving in from the embassy and the one that the navy lieutenants were driving in behind me they have shut us out you go to japan it is pretty much the same story i said before you need to hire a detective to find an american car in japan so we have had very little success in enforcing our trade agreements overseas we have got a lousy deal so all i am asking is look i believe inand you know what i have to say the eu did it right the eu when they negotiated with south korea they said if you are going to sell cars into the eu from korea we want 30 percent of the components in that car to be made in the eu and they created a lot of work for their auto parts industry think about it we could do that congress could do that we could maintain that if they are going to sell a foreign car here we want 40 percent or 50 percent of the components to be manufactured here in the united states we would create millions of jobs in the united states there is nothing wrong with that it is a good thing we would restore industrial and manufacturing capacity in the united states if congress got back in the game i am not against free trade i think free trade works when it is balanced i want somebody in there fighting for the american worker we dont have that now we dont have that now congress has abdicated its responsibility by

are awards of taxpayer money to frivolous lowpriority projects like producing a climate change musical creating a voicemail game or studying tourism in norway one would think that fundamental standards like worthy of federal funding and in the national interest would already be embedded in the standards the national science foundation uses to evaluate thousands of grant applications and

new policies to make nsf grantmaking more transparent and understandable for the american people these policies acknowledge the primary importance of national interest in awarding tax dollars in fact

is another issue there are over 10 000 taxing agencies in the united states today imagine if we you your constituents everyone in the country who uses the internet has to pay for access to the internet every time they go to use it that they would be taxed on that so the temporary or the moratorium bill that we have now this one makes it permanent this is a bipartisan effort over 200 cosponsors in the congress are on it we want to encourage expanded broadband adoption if you tax it you are going to shrink it and i think in the communities that are of lower economic means this is going to hurt them even more we need to do everything we can to ensure that internet access is universally affordable this bill is an important component of that effort by permanently eliminating the taxation of internet access the current moratorium as my colleagues have said expires october 1 and we want to be ahead of that to keep the door open but no taxation to access i want to salute the chairman chairman goodlatte we are good friends we have worked on other efforts as i said this bill has nearly 200 bipartisan cosponsors and strong support of the communications internet and ecommerce industries so i would urge all of my colleagues to support this and understand that from the ground up we want to expand the use of broadband in our country for every community whether they are poor whether they are rural whether they are in a city whether they are middle class individuals we dont want to weigh the internet down with taxation of average people in this country it would really be unfair and i think it would smother the internet as we know it"], [0.00652921199798584, 0.5065292119979858, 1, "the date was april 14 1970 the mission was apollo 13 the message was houston we have a problem that was a clarion call from a mission that was in trouble tonight i ring and sound this clarion call from the people of houston texas because we have some troubles we have trouble that is related to floodwaters in houston texas that inundated our city and caused great harm and great damages i am on a mission of mercy tonight a mission of mercy on behalf of my constituents in houston but also on behalf of all of those in houston and the immediate area i am on this mission of mercy but i am not without a solution we have a solution to the flooding problem in houston texas and that solution is h r 5025 it is a bill that will help to mitigate the flood damages it will not eliminate the flood damages in houston texas i am not sure that we can construct a system that will totally eliminate all flood damages in houston texas but i am sure that we can mitigate that we can eliminate many that we can do something about the magnitude of the problem i am absolutely confident that my mother was correct when she informed me that there will be times in life when you cannot do enough no matter what you do you wont be able to do enough but she also went on to explain to me when you cannot do enough and more needs to be done you have a duty to do all that you can i am here tonight to let this congress know that we can do more to help in houston texas we can do more to mitigate the flood damages that we have in houston texas this bill h r 5025 would accord 311 million this money would be for projects that have already been approved that are related to flood control in houston projects that have not been completed this bill would authorize this funding up to 2026 this bill is needed in houston texas for many many reasons i shall share but a few then i will yield to a colleague and then i will say more this bill is needed because it would not only mitigate the flood damages but it would also help us with jobs for those who are interested in jobs this bill would create 6 220 jobs the people who acquire these jobs will pay taxes these taxpayers will help us in turn by helping with some of our fire our police and schools there are many ways that these tax dollars will be used including a good deal of them sent to washington d c to help others across the length and breadth of our great country this bill will save lives i will say more about that and my colleague may say something about this as well but i think it is important for us to note now that this bill will have a meaningful powerful significant impact on houston texas i am proud to tell you that this congress has been helpful we have already accorded for one project 212 million but we need 34 million to complete the project this is the brays project in houston texas we need 34 million more to complete it this project is in an area where we do get flooding in the meyerland area this project would help prevent homes from being flooded and cars from being damaged this is a great project we just need to finish the project the project was authorized in 1990 and it is projected to be finished in 2021 while i do want to make sure we complete it i do think it is taking us a bit too long to complete the brays project the golden gate bridge with all of its majesty only took 4 years approximately to complete the hoover dam a great monument to what we can do to channel water and turn that water into electrical power only took 5 years to complete for the erie canal we didnt have the advances in technology that we have today yet the erie canal took 8 years to complete i spoke of apollo 13 just a moment ago well it only took us 8 years to place a person on the moon surely if we can place a person on the moon in 8 years we can complete these projects in less than 30 years i am honored at this time to yield to my colleague who is a cosponsor of this piece of legislation who serves us well in the congress of the united states on the energy and commerce committee a real stalwart when it comes to serving his constituents and standing up for the people of our city our county our state and indeed our country the honorable gene green"], [0.012171447277069092,

nation with the strong background that you have and with the obvious depths of knowledge that you have about those who are mentally ill and the compassion you have in a field that is very difficult where the answers still remain incomplete i want to be on the floor this evening to say to those who are listening in the chamber to those who may be listening outside your efforts to draft the helping families in mental health crisis act h r 2646 is a watershed moment in this congress i have served in this congress a lot longer than the others on the floor this evening i was here in 1998 when sadly we lost two of our capitol police officers jacob chestnut and john gibson a diagnosed schizophrenic receiving federal ssi benefits but off his medicines and estranged from his family headed on a rampage all across the country all the way from the west to here and delusionally he set out to quash i guess a purple force he had tracked here to the capitol he broke into the majority leaders office all the staff went under the desks i thought well maybe this is the moment that congress will finally face up to the violent impulses that have fallen right at our knees i said but i would wager one of two things will happen either we will finally cut the mustard and do what is right or we will have more barricades and armed officers well it was the latter option that actually happened as we mourn the deaths of nine innocent victims at umpqua community college i commend congressman murphy of pennsylvania for putting a bill forward that forces us to probe deeply the pattern of these mass shootings we need to know the perpetrators we understand the perpetrator in oregon had served in the unitedstates military for a very brief time he was discharged and my question to the unitedstates military is why why was he discharged did you discharge him to care if you saw a pattern that needed treatment or did you close your eyes too because that has happened repeatedly in the unitedstates military though i must say that they are doing a little bit better because some of their own members have now been killed around the country because of individuals who face very severe illnesses in their own lives and have simply never had the kind of doctor to help them come out of the dark shadows of the existence in which they have been living many of these individuals have been abandoned by their families many times they are expelled from school as you look around the country and you see the people who commit these heinous heinous crimes and then many times take their own life they are completely alone or they are living with one member of their family abandoned by their other family members and as the gentleman from pennsylvania has said many times ending up homeless the victims of attacks themselves or many times out of whatever is happening in a very ill brain taking it out on the rest of society probing deeply into mental illness requires a discipline that congressman murphy has and an understanding that no congress yet has had that myopia is symptomatic of what is happening across our nation more security but no significant attention to those who show outofcontrol and violent tendencies those tragically mentally ill citizens who are driven by their illness to harm others if someone has a broken back we have special wards what happens to the mentally ill in the district that i represent and across this country some of them end up in the jail seventyfive percent of those incarcerated in northern ohio have dual diagnoses of mental illness and substance abuse what does that tell us our jails have become the depositories for this nations mentally ill i am not saying that individuals diagnosed with mental illness are more likely to commit crimes i agree with congressman murphy that most of them become victims of crimes because they arent thinking straight and it doesnt have to be this way the bill that congressman murphy has written and has vetted and has worked with different groups and individuals and which i support and a host of other members do on a bipartisan basis is supported by one of the most important organizations in our country the national alliance on mental illness i have the highest respect for them h r 2646 fixes the nations broken mental health system by refocusing programs reforming grants and removing federal barriers to care it names an assistant secretary for mental illness at the department of health and human services and it encourages more meaningful involvement from family members and caregivers who frankly at this point many times just give up because they have this force within their homes that they cannot contain rather than just paying tribute to those among us who have been lost and those who save them at risk to their own lives cannot we elevate the solution to efforts that could help to prevent further tragedies we think about the capitol shootings we think about sandy hook we think about virginia polytechnic the unitedstates leads the world in mass shootings there have been 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone and each one gives us an indicator of the possible sign of untreated mental illness each one represents a failure of our society and dispelling the stigma of mental illness for those who suffer remains a task unfinished when do the elected representatives of the american people say enough america can do better america must do better lets create a pathway by passing h r 2646 to immediate treatment for those mentally ill citizens dangerous to others and dangerous to themselves congressman murphy i cant thank you enough i dont recall a bill which has had such broad bipartisan support you have worked so hard to go around the country this is not a partisan issue this is an american issue i hope america can lead the world in trying to find a better way the suffering that we see in our districts in community after community after community broken families broken people this doesnt have to be in our country in the hearing that you conducted in cleveland i learned something really important that i didnt know and that is that in the way that the reimbursement occurs to hospitals for people seeking care that research in mental illness is at the bottom of the list because reimbursement doesnt flow the same way so as we try to find answers to what is going on in the human brain with the secretion of such chemicals like dopamine and serotonin and these different chemicals that those who are healthy have being secreted at a normal level those who do not have that system working for them have big problems but yet if doctors try to get research dollars to solve and figure out what is going on in the human brain the reimbursement system we have today simply doesnt work i didnt know that so i thank you for coming to ohio because i am focused on that like a laser beam and it is a part of the answer so thank you for allowing me some time tonight on the floor the people i represent thank you we want to help you i hope those listening will find cosponsors from their different parts of the country to help you move this bill forward

important pieces of tax legislation h r 644 and h r 636 the resolution provides a closed rule for consideration of each bill and provides for 90 minutes of debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the committee on ways and means on each bill in addition the rule provides for a motion to recommit on each bill most of my colleagues will remember the houses consideration of h r 5771 the tax increase prevention act of 2014 in december of last year at that time more than 50 individual tax extenders were retroactively extended for the 2014 tax year giving businesses just 12 days to make complicated investment decisions that is no way to run a business every time i am at home i hear from oklahomans who either work for or own small businesses without fail they tell me that certainty is what they need most from washington but too often washington tells americans who operate and work in small businesses to trust us we promise to extend x or y or z tax provision indefinitely unfortunately those americans cant take that to the bank they cant take our word that we will actually be able to deliver on the promises made by congress the only thing they can rely on is the law if our tax laws expire every year it injects an uncertainty into the business environment that inhibits economic growth even though we were able to retroactively extend those tax provisions at the end of last year they are already expired again instead of continuing this cycle of uncertainty it is important to put these tax cuts in place early so that we dont end up in a situation like we did last year i applaud chairman ryan for beginning early with provisions we all agree on this rule will provide for consideration of permanent extension of seven different tax provisions provisions like section 179 expensing and provisions like extending the deduction of ira distributions to charities all of us republicans and democrats have supported these measures in the past at least on a temporary basis these are tax provisions that we retroactively extended less than 2 months ago why shouldnt we make these popular tax provisions permanent and do it now not retroactively late in the year some have criticized this legislation because it isnt paid for i think chairman ryan said it best in the rules committee on tuesday these are provisions of the tax code which we routinely extend year after year they are effectively part of the existing tax code permanently reauthorizing them reflects the policy this country has maintained for years under both republican and democratic administrations and congress and doing so provides business with the certainty that they desperately seek finally i want to take a few moments to note that just as we have had to examine and pare back the discretionary side of the budget we need to examine and pare back the tax side of the budget there are over 200 tax expendituresor spending on the tax side of the ledgerthat if all are extended will cost the federal government more than 12 trillion over the next 10 years many of these provisions are worthy but many others should clearly be eliminated the sheer complexity of the tax code and associated regulations should push us towards reforms so that our tax code works for us all in the 21st century i want to commend chairman ryan for beginning this process in earnest and look forward to the consideration of additional measures at the appropriate time i urge support for the rule and the underlying legislation i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.01462256908416748,
