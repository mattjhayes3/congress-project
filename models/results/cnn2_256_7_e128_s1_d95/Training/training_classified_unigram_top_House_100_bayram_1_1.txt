abused and of course who doesnt favor real civil rights in this country we all do but the problem we have is that weve perverted the concept of civil rights and are using it as an excuse to bring the heavy hand of the federal government down on a wide range of schools churches farms businesses and other organizations many members will feel good about themselves for voting for civil rights but if they would take a minute to look at the consequences of this misnamed bill they might reconsider one example will illustrate just how farreaching this legislation will be its effect on grocery stores im not necessarily talking about huge chain grocery stores like safeway im talking about a typical mom and pop small corner grocer these stores will be covered in their entirety by this legislation simply because they participate in governments food stamp program a grocery store falls within the definition of an entity receiving assistance as a whole under section 3 a or under 3 b as a geographically separate facility our former colleague paul simon admitted that grocery stores are intended to be subject to coverage under this type of bill the small provider provision in the bill does not exempt grocery stores it only relieves them of one burden under section 504 and only under very limited circumstances has anyone suggested that there are problems with discrimination in buying food the grocery store example only illustrates how extreme this legislation is there is of course no exemption for churches and synagogues that may be required to enforce policies that go against the very nature of their faith we would be using this civil rights bill to trample on the rights guaranteed in the first amendment family farms that receive price supports could be subjected to the same grueling paperwork requirements to comply with this law all these devastating requirements could be put into effect even if the employer has never had a complaint registered for violating any civil rights statute we are in effect violating their due process by passing this civil rights bill a better name for this bill would be the comprehensive federal instrusion act of 1988 if this

aisle reflects that reality in nicaragua today it does in fact keep the contras alive as a force it will maintain them in the field in a manner consistent with the tentative truce or ceasefire that has been negotiated between the contras and the sandinistas it is supported by the president of the united states in a meeting yesterday at the white house he made it clear that he would like to have congress approve this package furthermore it is desired by the leaders of the democratic resistance specifically adolfo calero cesar colonel bermudez the leaders of the contra alliance have made it very clear that they would like very much to have this assistance and that it is crucial to the survival of their forces i also think it is extremely important that we focus upon the commitment that the speaker has made to the republican leader that in the event of a violation of the ceasefire by the sandinistas that the president may submit a request for additional assistance and that that request will be given timely consideration in the house specifically that it will be referred to the appropriate committees so that the committees will report within 10 days 10 legislative days and

does not resolve those differences many of us are determined to do everything we can to resist the consolidation of the communist regne in nicaragua to do everything we can to limit and reverse the growth and spread of soviet influence in central america and to do everything we can to make certain that nicaragua never again becomes a base for subversion of other democracies in the hemisphere

heads and our hearts and i think we saw a little bit of the hearts before on both sides of the aisle on this contra issue it is clear to me that my head and my heart come to the same conclusion and that conclusion is no on contra aid my head tells me that since peace is the goal of the president and the congress we should follow the explicit advice of the one who got the peace process started president oscar arias of costa rica who states that we should not vote for contra aid today how can we seriously tell anyone that we are for peace while going against the recommendation of oscar arias and at the same time telling him that we are doing what we are doing because we really have the answer for peace and he does not that is a little bit like seeing an elderly lady on the corner and grabbing her and making her go across the street when all the while she is saying to you i dont want to go how patronizing that is and how wrong that is now my head also tells me that in 6 years of a very bloody contra war we have seen no democratic process in nicaragua the stated purpose of the contra war is to bring democracy to nicaragua yet nothing happened until the peace process began to move so when the president says we need pressure to change the sandinistas i say the very best pressure is the pressure from the region from the latin american countries and they say this is the wrong time for contra aid those countries will put the pressure on the sandinistas through the peace process and if it does not workand there is no guarantee that it will workif it does not work and the sandinistas do not follow through there will not be any inhibition on their part to isolate the sandlinistas and develop a policy that we can play a true role in shaping february 1988 co my head also tells me that we have far better ways to spend this money it is interesting i say to my colleagues that today in the armed services committee we received a reprogramming from the administration in other words in order to pay for this contra aid we are cutting certain military programs from missiles to ships i find this rathcr incredible after 7 years of telling us there was not one way we could save 1 dollar from the military the reagan administration had no trouble at all in finding 56 million worth of cuts to pay for the contra aid package we may ask why 56 million when the package is for 36 million well just as anything else in this area this is not clear either it turns out that we need an additional 20 million for insurance for the planes that will be delivering the supplies so 56 million must be set aside for this program not 36 million may i propose that we can do some other things with this 50 million first we could cut the deficit now a lot of you out there who support these dollars today wish to do that we could do that then we could house a lot of homeless if we did not want to cut the deficit or maybe what we want to do is give 10 000 college scholarships to needy american students with the understanding that upon their graduation they would join a latin american peace corps for a year and do what americans do best help out our fellow human beings on this planet with health care and literacy and economic development that is the way to make america a leader and to have other nations throughout the world following our lead rather than turning to other powers so m head tells me that contra aid has not worked that the peace process does that we should listen to the latin american democracies and there are better ways to spend these dollars here at

are ethical and they are correct central america is our neighbor to end aid to the contras is not to end our involvement there we must be involved we must help our neighbors get to the roots of their

letters on every solicitation and application what those interest rates are let us see what the consumer will do what do you think the consumer would do when one ad says in this socalled schumer box which has the annual rate the annual fee and the grace period 19 5 percent in big clear letters and an ad in the same magazine has 13 5 percent in big letters does anyone doubt that the market will crack i believe it will i believe that tough disclosure will help us finally achieve the goal we set out upon years ago which was to get the market to crack and bring the rates down to the rates of other types of loans some say maybe we should do it with a cap and initially i thought the cap was the way to go i introduced the bill that had a cap but at that time all the banks were at 18 9 percent and disclosure would not do much good because everyone would be saying the same thing now there is diversity in the market and disclosure can work it can work in a very real and significant way on the other hand we could beat our breasts and pass a cap amendment here today we most certainly could but it would probably inevitably foil any attempt to get any law and bring us to the goal we have worked so hard to get which is interest rates down because in the other body it is no secret we have all read the statements many of those leaders have said you send us a bill with a cap and there is no legislation and of course the white house if we brought a cap bill would veto it let us accomplish something get the market to crack pass h r 515 and help consumers in the way they so

the others that were furloughed they certainly were not turned loose for the weekend or their 72hour pass or whatever it is their weeks pass with no money in their pockets no prison in this nation takes a man who has served 5 10 20 or 30 years and turns him loose on the street with no money you have to have money for some clothing that is supplied and they give you money for an apartment they give you a parole officer and they give you certainly car fare to get from the prison gates to the downtown area wherever you are allowed to take up residence under your particular patrol what do they give these furloughed people for money do they have enough money to rent a car do they have enough money to eat three square meals a day for the number of days they are out do they have taxi fare bus

reauthorized periodically and its last authorization which was for a period of 4 years expired on september 30 1987 ofpp over the years has served a valuable purpose in promoting efficiency and

within that process additional safeguards to prevent these abuses we are all aware of the waste that results from excessive regulation i think it has been proven that too much regulation is harmful to

rules against the release of inside procurement information and it prohibits a federal procurement official from becoming an employee of a contractor on a contract for a period of 3 years after ceasing to work for the government on that contract the bill also requires that prior to contract award all participants must certify that the requirements of the section have been followed this bill
