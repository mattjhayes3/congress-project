issue of unusual importance to the future of republican party at the heart of the matter is one of the federal governments most fundamental constitutional functions the united states census at stake is our gop majority in the house of representatives as well as partisan control of state legislatures nationwide the clinton administration is implementing a radical new way of taking the next census that effectively will add nearly four and onehalf million democrats to the nations population this is the political outcome of a controversial executive decision to use a complex mathematical formula to estimate and adjust the 2000 census using this process democrats gain a critical advantage in the next redistricting that will undermine gop efforts to elect republicans to both federal and state offices a reliable analysis done for the rnc by polidata political analysis reveals that a statistically altered census will have a sweeping political impact that clearly imperils the partys present congressional majority the gop would suffer a negative effect in the partisan makeup of 24 congressional seats 113 state senate seats and 297 state house seats nationwide a statebystate summary is attached for your reference many of these legislative districts are in states where majorities are held by only the narrowest of margins an adjusted census could provide democrats the crucial edge needed to prevail in close contests to control several state legislative chambers the census does have problems and improvements are needed to insure a successful effort but an adjusted census ignores the constitutions call for an actual enumeration republican leaders are committed to providing the needed resources for a complete count as directed by the founders census adjustment raises many legal ethical and technical concerns yet democrats faithfully promote it as the solution dont be fooled an adjusted census is part of a longterm democrat strategy to regain control of congress and elect

legislative representation a census adjustment could shift some federal funding levels but it should be stressed that the language coming out of conference is planned to be specific for apportionment

is being driven by the national level although i do appreciate the leadership of the administration and vice president gore this is an issue that is being driven from the grassroots many of us are aware that in 1998 there were over 240 state and local ballot measures nationwide that dealt with issues of open space land use planning and environmental protection and transportation seventytwo percent of these measures passed involving spending of over 7 5 billion even in the relatively quiet socalled off year of 1999 the drumbeat continued there were 139 ballot measures with a 77 percent

development an area larger than the state of west virginia we as a nation are sprawling faster than we increase in population in the last 5 years the population grew by 5 percent while developed land area increased 18 percent in fact we are seeing communities around the country that are actually losing population yet are gobbling up land at a 10 percent 20 percent 30 percent rate in a decade this

of the united states on tuesday november 7 this is the centerpiece of our democracy the election of a president the president has his own powers according to the constitution but also the power of appointment of the third branch of government the supreme court so a great deal is at stake in this election the presidency and the presidents appointments to the court if the next president appoints just one or two more justices to the court and they do not support some of our basic fundamental rights fundamental rights could be abolished or curtailed the supreme courts decisions affect all aspect of our lives including basic civil rights and daytoday pursuit of life liberty and happiness it is significant to note i think that no supreme court justice has retired in 6 years the longest interval without a new appointment in 177 years in the last 50 years every president except one has appointed at least one justice and 8 of the last 10 presidents have appointed 2 justices court watchers expect several justices to retire soon and thus the next president is likely to appoint several justices to fill these vacancies i mention this because many have asked well how do these elections affect young people in our country well the election of the president affects them very directly in the decisions that that president will make but also very directly in terms of his power of appointment of the court the supreme court and indeed many many scores qf federal court justices as i have said the supreme court makes many decisions that fundamentally affect and change our lives and so young people should be very interested in these judges this president and the decisions that this court will make because it will have an impact for generations to come soon the court will be deciding cases governing civil rights workers rights reproductive freedom voting rights and campaign finance reform the court will decide congress authority to apply federal laws protecting individuals and our environment to the states including the americans with disabilities act the court will address electoral redistricting and minority voting rights free speech criminal cases involving unreasonable search and seizure and the scope of federal regulations really protections and safeguards for all americans how do the courts decisions on these issues affect our lives for women the court has an impact on reproductive freedom for workers the court affects the ability to sue employers who violate employees civil rights again for women the court affects access to family planning clinics and access to safe and appropriate medical care for gay and lesbian americans the court affects civil rights protections and equal opportunity for people with disabilities the court affects protections in the americans with disabilities act i asked one volunteer in a political campaign why she was volunteering and she said i have looked around studied the issues and i realize that people in politics make decisions about the air i breathe and the water i drink the same applies to the supreme court the court affects the air we breathe and the water we drink by determining the legality of the clean air and clean water act this volunteer went on to say so i guess i should be interested in politics at least for as long as i drink water and i breathe air young people should be and we should all be interested in the court and the person who will name justices to that court for at least as long as we breathe air and drink water the two issues that i would like to just focus on in the interest of time because i know the hour is late are a womans right to choose and the issue of the protection of our environment and how those issues will be affected by the court the next president will likely appoint two perhaps three supreme court justices enough to overturn roe v wade and allow states to enact severe and sweeping restrictions on womens reproductive rights if the antichoice majority maintains its control over the senate the supreme court nominations of an antichoice president are likely to be quickly confirmed governor george bush is an antichoice governor with a record to prove it in 1999 alone governor bush along with michigans governor engler signed more antichoice provisions into law than any other governor in the unitedstates governor bush has said he believes roe v wade went too far and has characterized the 1973 ruling as a reach governor bush has also said that justice antonin scalia arguably the most ardent opponent of abortion on the supreme court would be his model justice governor bush wants to end legal reproductive freedom in the unitedstates al gore would protect a womans right to choose the choice is clear prochoice americans must understand that governor bush will use the power of the presidency to end legal reproductive choice and take away a womans right to choose in terms of the environment moving on to that because i know that is an issue that young people are interested in as well i mentioned that governor bush has said that his model justice was justice scalia sadly justice scalias environmental philosophy is just as dismal as some of the other issues that i mentioned here legal scholars who have studied the supreme court have found that justice scalia sided against the environment more than any other person in the history of the court how bad is his record eightyseven percent of the time an environmental case came before the supreme court justice scalia decided againstthe environment in justice scalias world citizens would not be allowed to stop pollution just because a company is poisoning their backyards in a case decided earlier this year a factory had dumped toxic mercury into a nearby river 489 times how would you like that in your backyard but even though the factory poisoned the river nearly 500 times the justice felt that the court was making it far too easy to halt an environmental crime so when we come to issues that young people are interested in such as protecting the environment this environment that we have only on loan because it belongs to them it is their future we must protect it in every way that we can we can do that by our own personal kehavior through conservation by the people we elect to office to make decisions about the environment by the president of the united states who leads the country in protecting our environment and the justices that he will appoint to the court who will make decisions about the air we breathe and the water we drink for as long as we breathe air and drink water we should be very interested in those decisions again on the issue of a womans right to choose which i think is a matter that is at risk we are at a crossroads and one that will be very much affected by the outcome of the election i in the interest of time i will not go into all the other issues except to say that november 7 is an important day a day when we will be choosing notonly a president but that presidents appointees there is a great deal at stake for young people i hope they will pay attention to the election and its ramifications"],

the vahud bill does one thing it prevents the va from taking funding from the veterans medical care account to pay for lawsuits against tobacco companies our committee language does not i emphasize does not prevent the va from giving the justice department money to pursue their lawsuit so the gentlemans amendment is not necessary frankly i am no friend of tobacco of the industry but we have not worked so hard on our committee in a bipartisan way to increase the medical accounts over the past 4 years and the vas budget on behalf of our veterans to see the administration and the department of justice push our veterans out of the way so they can flog tobacco companies using funding from this and other appropriations bills the statistics are grim an estimated 30 000 veterans from the world war 11 era are dying each month these men and women need medical care today not 3 or 4 years down the road that is why none of this critical funding should be diverted from their medical care care that they have more than earned and deserve too much hasbeen taken away from our veterans already to deal them this additional blow for those who might forget or wish to forget the tea21 bill signed by the president in 1998 and sponsored by a majority in this chamber and supported by them cut veterans disability payments for smokingrelated illnesses by 14 4 billion to pay for highways and other important transportation projects i voted against this bill because that 15 4 billion should have been spent on compensating veterans with tobaccorelated illnesses or redirecting it into paying for veterans medical care for veterans with smokingrelated illnesses as well as other veterans instead of paving more highways and building more roads and taking care of more worthwhile projects now the administration is proposing to take 4 million from the fiscal year 2001 allocation for veterans medical care accounts to pay the justice departments legal expenses to sue tobacco companies some have argued to me that 4 million is a small amount of money and its diversion makes little difference overall to veterans medical care but i can tell the members 4 million would provide for veterans in my district a lot of necessary things related to hepatitis c related to prescription drugs our committee language already allows the va to use funding from somewhere else within its budget just not from an account that directly pays for veterans medical care there are a number of other accounts within the department of justice that the va can take money from including departmental administration general operating expenses medical administration and miscellaneous operating expenses construction major and minor projects other types of grants these accounts total over 1 36 billion and the va cannot find 4 million from those accounts to pay for this lawsuit that is incredible the secretary should cut his own budget and reduce administrative overhead before he raids the veterans medical care accounts to comply with white house directives the va should use every dollar appropriated for veterans medical care to provide for the men and women who fought our wars and to care for him who shall have borne the battle i do not oppose lawsuits against the tobacco industry i certainly do not receive any financial contributions from them i do oppose the use of veterans medical care dollars to pay for the justice departments lawsuit in closing let me repeat that this language does not prohibit the va from participating in the lawsuit our committee language does protect veterans medical

it is essential to not break the discipline of the 1997 budget agreement we just made that agreement we ought to stay within that agreement unfortunately in the blue dog budget that agreement is riot

the money we are reserving for social security but when this onbudget surplus comes as sure as god made little green apples if there is money sitting around on the table in this town i believe it will

parties what has happened out of all of this listening and working with them is that we passed an unfunded mandate bill that said we would not mandate more requirements on states and local communities without the money we have passed welfare reform where we took a whole slew of categorical programs packaged them together sent them back to the states so that states and local communities could decide

negotiated settlement of this insurgency that colombia can realistically expect to end the violence and turn its full attentions to a nationwide commitment to end the deadly narcotics trade which plagues that nation and brings so much destruction human suffering and violence to communities around the world while we should support peace efforts as embodied in this amendment we must be firm in

would have to pay that price were not the folks who gouged san diegans to begin with but the actual consumers who were the victims of this price gouging we must go beyond what the state of californias legislature did the federal government must act and can act the wholesale price of electricity can be set by the federal energy regulatory commission and this congress should direct that commission known as ferc to in fact roll back the wholesale price of electricity to the price thatwas paid before deregulation in which people had made profits and good profits at that price and yet they were charging and are now charging prices double triple quadruple five times what they were before deregulation i have a bill my colleagues called the help san diego act halt electricity price gouging in san diego and halt it now the people in san diego cannot survive the doubled and tripled prices of electricity rates small businesses are going under seniors are having to make choices between using their air conditioning or paying for their food or medical prescriptions i ask my colleagues to look closely at san diego a little dot on the southwest corner of our nation because we are the poster children for the future the rest of the state of california will soon be deregulated many of my colleagues in their states have deregulation bills in their legislatures this house has deregulation bills in front of it this deregulation cannot work my colleagues when a basic commodity is controlled by a few monopoly corporations the san diego example makes it clear the consumer must be protected if this kind of policy is going to be pursued deregulation in california took place without consumer protection it took place in an atmosphere of monopoly control of a basic commodity my city was in danger of dying economically we have stopped it temporarily with state legislative action but the federal government must act now ferc must roll back the wholesale price of electricity retroactively the people the companies who forced these unconscionable rates on the citizens of san diego should pay the price and not the consumers the victims themselves my colleagues look closely at san diego your city may be next"]]}
