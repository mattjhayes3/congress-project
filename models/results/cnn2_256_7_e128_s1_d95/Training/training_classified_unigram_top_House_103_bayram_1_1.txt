the courage and diligence he has shown in the enormous and complex task of crafting and refining legislation that reorganizes the unitedstates department of agriculture the issue of reorganizing the department of agriculture is one of agricultures most important policy challenges in decades and one of my first official actions as a member this body was to make a formal request that field hearings be held on this matter and that georgia be the site of one of those hearings and i also want to thank chairman stenholm of texas for bringing the subcommittee on department operations to georgia for this purpose the result of this legislation will have a profound impact on how all of our farm programs are implemented at the local level and here in washington for example it will provide a new emphasis on nutrition and save billions of dollars for the treasury by streamlining the delivery of services to citizens throughout the nation the department of agriculture is an extremely complex organization which has developed into a bureaucratic monster burdening our farmers with over regulation compromising the nutrition of our childrens school lunches and providing fodder for negative connotations associated with agriculture in the mind of the public we must take steps to correct this perception or all of our farm programs will remain in jeopardy i believe that we must streamline the department and its services and on that i hope we can all agree however we must move in a logical and careful manner most importantly we must not compromise our rural communities for the sake of bureaucratic convenience and never forget that our no 1 priority in this reorganization process is to improve the services provided to the customers of usdawhether it be farmers who participate in conservation programs farmers who use ascs farm programs or the children who are fed in our school lunch programs the agriculture department reorganization act reduces costs cuts waste streamlines operations and improves services to farmers and other customers of usda h r 3171 consolidates farm price support crop insurance and agricultural loan programs into a single farm service agency which allows farmers a onestop shop for farmer programs the bill places all agricultural conservation programs within a natural resources conservation service and reorganizes various rural development and rural electrification programs into a rural community development service h r 3171 streamlines usda by requiring a reduction in the number of its employees by 7 500 staffyears by the end of 1999 it is important to note that the bill requires larger staff cuts in the departments headquarters offices than in its field offices and the measure specifies that the overall reduction in headquarters personnel must be twice as great on a percentage basis as the reduction in field office personnel i mention these reductions to point out the wisdom in this bill that we are not abandoning our farmers and rural communities in this reorganization but we hope to achieve a more effective and costsavings delivery of services to the people who feed and clothe all the citizens of the united states and increasingly the world secretary espy should be commended for bringing this issue to the forefront and for his commitment to start the reorganization process here in usda washington offices before

francisco is a 1 400 acre military base located at the base of the golden gate bridge in san francisco it contains a combination of natural cultural and historical resources which are unparalleled in our nation with 220 years of military history captured in over 500 historic buildings natural beauty ranging from coastal bluffs to grasslands and forests endangered species and abundant recreational opportunities the presidio is a very unique place which is made even more remarkable by its location in the middle of a major urban metropolitan area in less than 5 months the presidio will be transferred from the army to the national park service to be administered as part of golden gate national recreation area this transfer is a result of a 1972 law which required the presidio to be transferred to the national park service when it was determined to be excess to the armys needs the golden gate national recreation area is currently the most visited unit of the national park system and the addition of the presidio will provide millions of national and international visitors with the opportunity to enjoy and learn from this truly unique area the national park service has spent the last 4 years developing a comprehensive plan for the future use of the presidio they have also developed a financial strategy to reduce the costs of operating and maintaining the presidio through an innovative public private partnership congress has already enacted legislation to provide for fiscal responsibility at the presidio last year we enacted a bill public law 103175 to authorize leasing of one of the highest revenue generating elements of the presidio the letterman lair hospital and research complex just yesterday the national park service announced their selection of two prospective tenants for detailed negotiations for occupancy of 1 2 million square feet of office space in order to reduce costs while at the same time preserving the rich history and natural features of the presidio existing buildings at the presidio will be leased to generate income the leasing will be done through the establishment of a public benefit corporation with expertise and experience in real estate and leasing transactions this is the essence of h r 3433 legislation introduced by representative nancy pelosi and cosponsored by 123 members of the house the subcommittee on national parks forests and public lands which i chair has held hearings on this legislation and a competing proposal introduced by the author of the amendment representative duncan we have scheduled a markup on h r 3433 for next week in the subcommittee and expect to have a bill on the floor next month representative duncans amendment would wreak havoc and destroy the ability of the national park service to carry out essential daily operations including maintenance fire prevention utilities communications emergency medical services and law enforcement although the amendment purports to save money it would very likely increase costs to the taxpayer first it would lead to deterioration of buildings and infrastructure at the presidio which in turn make it more difficult to get paying tenants second it would cut funding the national park service at the critical stage for the funding needed to make appraisals prepare contracts and negotiate leases with prospective tenants members from both sides of the aisle myself included have rightfully raised questions about the potential costs of the presidio i take these concerns very seriously and i have always been willing to work with members and stand ready to address these concerns in the proposed authorizing legislation pertaining to the presidio mr duncans amendment offers no solutions or suggestions about how to address the complex issues of the presidio transfer in fact a recent hearing in the subcommittee on national parks forests and public lands revealed that representative duncans approach of selling off certain presidio lands would cost up to 100 million more than the approach taken in representative pelosis legislation it is important to remember that the transfer of the presidio to the national park service will be a significant savings to the federal government in comparison to its operation as a military installation members of congress should know that the operation of the presidio by the department of defense costs up to 30 to 40 million more per year than what it will cost as a national park the average taxpayer will spend less but will gain more from an enhanced ability to enjoy the natural historical and recreational resources of the presidio several other points should be made about costs of the presidio as the accompanying chart demonstrates the presidio maybe the only unit of the national park system for which federal funding need declines over time again this is due to the innovative leasing strategy which will result in increasing revenues to offset the need for appropriated funds furthermore the public benefit corporation will accomplish much of the repair and rehabilitation of presidio buildings through private borrowing instead of appropriated construction dollars seven out of ten dollars for site and building rehabilitation will be borrowed from capital markets instead of being appropriated from this interior appropriations committee the duncan amendment is a

the issue is how we promote human rights threatening to revoke mfn is only effective as a threat if we are prepared to accept total disengagement from china beyond that simple reality is another one targeted trade sanctions will undermine our national security interests in this area of the world rapidly growing in importance let me suggest the following three principles for united stateschina policy principle 1 promote human rights through an unconditional extension of mfn that is not a contradiction of terms or of policy the best foreign policy tools available to us to encourage political and civil reform abroad are policies that promote capitalism market reform and free trade all three are powerful levers for political change precisely because they are powerful mechanisms for economic change our foreign policy towards china should embrace these tools not condition them these are precisely the tools we can use to promote the evolution of chinese society so that its people will be able to press for political reform from within they are the tools to stimulate chinese society to adopt a more pluralistic and democratic political process that in turn inevitably leads to greater respect for human rights and personal liberty the issue involved in revoking mfn or conditioning china ttade has never been whether or not we condone political repression in china rather the fundamental question is this what action of the united states will further democratic reforms in china let me suggest to my colleagues that we can illafford to undermine reformminded chinese who depend on trade and economic contracts as a means of prying china open for political freedom principle 2 elevate national security economic considerations to create a more balanced unitedstates foreign policy the united states must develop a more balanced china foreign policy in order to take into account our national security interests the cold war may be over in central and eastern europe but in asia it is still alive economically china represents a dynamic expanding market for united states exports in our most competitive high paying industries but it isnt for selfish economic reasons we believe continuing mfn is the wisest policy we can follow rather i would argue that a trade policy that is unilateral that lacks support of our major trading partners is a policy that will undermine our national security interests principle 3 continue foreign policy engagement and utilize other measures to support human rights objectives promoting respect for human rights should continue to be a key objective of united states foreign policy toward china we should continue to apply our own as well as use multilateral diplomatic preserves to bring about change we should encourage respect for human rights by expanding cultural academic political and business contact to share our values because i support the promotion of human rights because i support it with and

instead penalize those very institutions by denying them federal funding if they do not ensure that opportunity to learn standards to be established by yet another washington dc federal board are adopted before a state is eligible to receive federal funding through this bill the state must develop opportunitytolearn standards but the bill does not provide the funds necessary to even begin to

good example of how some believe states look to the federal government to show them how to improve education this simply is not true my parents were teachers my sister is a teacher and from their

parental choice in education which will make it possible for families to no longer be relegated to ineffective schools simply because of the location of their homes it also gives parents the right to

free markets newly free and developing nations are hungry for change totalitarian ideology is on the run around the globe while we see and read about the terrible genocide in the balkans we must recognize that the nature of news is essentially negative and remind ourselves democracy and a new respect for human rights are germinating and growing in south and central america the former soviet

the changed global situation is enhanced unitedstates security we are safer now than we have been in over 40 years as a consequence we are able to reduce our military expenditures substantially without the economic military and development assistance in this bill our ability to broject unitedstates influence overseas would be limited to military options and the defense budget would not be able to be reduced as substantially as is planned the best example of this trade off is the 2 5 billion in assistance included for the states of the former soviet union this small investment in

subcommittee has provided ample funds in the esf and fmv accounts to fully meet our camp david commitments to israel and egypt and has made it very clear in this bill that it expects the administration to disperse these funds as it has in the past israel is the united states most important ally in the middle east more importantly it is a haven for refugees from the former soviet union and ethiopia where they have been persecuted both officially and unofficially for hundreds of years the funding that the united states provides to israel helps it maintain its qualitative military edge in a region where all but one of its neighbors refuse to recognize its right to exist it also assists the israelis in assimilating the huge number of new arrivals and provide decent housing and economic opportunity for them i am very pleased that the foreign operations subcommittee has included these funds and that the foreign affairs committee showed clear support for israel by earmarking them this bill also makes a strong statement about the importance of strengthening bilateral and multilateral voluntary family planning programs h r 2295 contains 392 million for the aid population program and 50 million for the united nations population fund rapid population growth is one of the most pressing problems facing the world poverty environmental degradation malnutrition and infant and child mortality caused by improperly spaced births are all direct results of the lack of adequate global access to voluntary family planning services in addition as prof paul kennedy clearly lays out in his latest book rapid population growth that is not accompanied by economic growth is a politically destabilizing force the highest growth rates in the world today are in the arab states of the middle east world population is presently increasing by 1 billion people every 11 years the human misery and irreversible environmental problems caused by population growth will only increase without action this bill addresses this urgent need and makes substantial increases in funding for population programs the bill also forcefully addresses the pressing problem of global environmental degradation with a central focus on promoting sustainable development as the report to accompany the bill makes clear economic growth must be predicated on sustainable use of resources rather than their exploitation funding is provided for an appropriately structured global environmental facility which is designed to assist developing countries pursue projects with global environmental benefits

to delete at the appropriate pcint in adopting this section the committee took action to address a longstanding inequity between active and reserve component forces this addressed the vital issue of providing welltrained linguists for our military commanders in the field section 501 initially provtded that members of the national guard and reserve components who maintain a language proficiency at the same level as their active duty counterparts would receive the same pay 100 per month to maintain this proficiency at tlhe present rate for the reserve components 13 a month there is simply no incentive for the reserves to spend the long hours necessary to keep their language proficiency the provision was amended at the full committee markup to increase monthly pay to a maximum 450 per month for active duty and reservists who maintain fluency in two foreign languages as we downside our military forces we need to maintain these capabilities within the reserve components as more and more missions are being shifted to them the only way that one can do this is by insuring that there is an incentive for the reserves and national guard personnel who have language skills to maintain them and improve them section 501 as amended would have addressed longstanding pay inequities and provided a strong financial reward for proficiency my colleague mr skelton on the armed services committee felt we needed to study the proposal further and test it through a pilot program i agreed with him but i will continue to focus on language programs and work to ensure there is parity in language proficiency pay between active and reserve components it is noteworthy that judge louis freeh the candidate for director of the fbi said at his confirmation hearing that we need more agents

current administration to continue using a management tool which congress has given to the last halfdozen presidents i voted to give this authority to ronald reagan in 1988 to george bush in 1991 and i will vote today to give it to bill clinton the president has asked us for an extension of this authority so that ambassador kantor can try to conclude at last negotiations on improvements to the general agreement on tariffs and trade the rule book for world trade the people of this country would be well served if an agreement could be reached which meets the unitedstates objectives set out nearly 7 years ago fasttrack authority while not ideal is a practical and relatively fair way of negotiating agreements it is unfortunate that the extension of fasttrack authority has become a controversial issue and for some a tough vote if a particular trade agreement is of questionable merit we can and should consider voting it down what we must not do is link any particular trade agreement to the process by which this government conducts trade negotiations with other countries today we have heard as we did during the 1991 debate complaints that the elected representatives of the american people should not be barred from making changes in a trade agreement i find it somewhat frustrating to be forced to wholly accept or reject a trade agreement however fasttrack procedures do call for consultation with congress and i am confident that this house would appropriately reject any agreement that was negotiated without the proper consultations perhaps most importantly i do not believe that it would be possible for this government to negotiate a marketopening trade agreement with any other nation if every one of the 535 members of congress were at the negotiating table think of it we would be bickering with one another with our president and with the representatives of the other nation it would be chaotic and impractical and there would be no guarantee that the people of this country would be better served by such an arrangement the effort and international political capital that has already been expended in the hope that we might have a stronger world trading system should not must not be set aside on the contrary we should build on it we have so much to gain a world trade system that will finally cover trade in agricultural products services and invest ment a system where the united states can obtain prompt relief when a trading partner violates the rules a system that will deny profits to those who would produce cheap copies of softwear music pharmaceutical and other products created by american talent and ingenuity if we are to improve our trade performance and open new markets for unitedstates exports we must strengthen the world trading system so that it protects honest traders if we are to pave the way for new highwage manufacturing jobs for american workers jobs that would be created to meet the demand for unitedstates goods in a less protectionist trading environment we must strengthen the world trading system if we are to continue to raise the unitedstates standard of living which would be a natural consequence of new markets and more jobs we must strengthen the world trade system if we say no to fast track today and thus no to any improvements in gar job opportunities will be lost and we will be a less prosperous nation i urge my colleagues to reject that scenario and to vote to extend fasttrack authority today"], [0.0004055798053741455, 0.49959442019462585, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i really find it very surprising that my amendment is controversial i think it is selfexplanatory it would require that counselors in title x clinics who are providing information on what h r 670 terms pregnancy management options that is prenatal care adoption and abortion among others have a professional degree in medicine nursing clinical psychology the allied health professions or social work my reason for offering this is quite simple if part of the purpose of the title x program is to provide quality care and advice to pregnant women then i believe it is only reasonable to require that the advice be given by a qualified professional during all the debate on the socalled gag rule and this title x policy over the years we have heard from the proponents of the title x program that counseling is being done by professionals and that the bush administration and those of us that oppose the process are gagging professional medical service providers and professional counselors therefore i feel it is extremely important to emphasize that professionalism so that women particularly underaged women that find themselves pregnant and come to a family planning clinic for advice be protected from receiving uninformed or inexperienced advice it bothers me when i read from a planned parenthood preliminary report on the counseling function in their affiliates throughout the nation that and i quote data from the nearly 500 individual counselor profiles give a clear picture of a counseling staff which is largely young and inexperienced much of it working unpaid and probably using ppfa employment for training experience and preparation for other jobs in the future counselors formal training is relatively modest a lawsuit involving the planned parenthood association of san mateo county in california further illustrates my point in this case a planned parenthood employee with the job title reproductive health specialist stated in a deposition that she had had no prior experience or education in medical care nor had she even had a biology course before being hired for that position rather the prior job experience of this socalled reproductive health specialist was as an architectural drafter for various corporations she was given 2 months onthejob training by the center manager who also had no prior medical training this reproductive health specialist was responsible not only for performing medical exams on clients she was also charged with providing information on human reproduction and counseling pregnant women on their reproductive choices there is something very wrong with this situationif i were a woman who expected to receive professional care and advice when going to a federally funded clinic i would find this very upsetting even as recently as last month i noticed a help wanted ad in the washington post in which a northern virginia planned parenthood clinic was advertising for a fulltime educatorcounselor the ad reads as follows the clinic provides family planning hiv pregnancy options counseling and medical services college education desirable bicultural and bilingual spanish drivers 11cense car isnt it sad and even frightening that for this pregnancy counseling position one must have a drivers license but not a college degree while i cannot comment as to the professionalism of this particular clinic or whether it receives title x funds this ad serves as an obvious example of what my amendment attempts to correct i do not think it is right for the federal govermnent to fund clinics that hire individuals without even a college degree to counsel pregnant women on one of the most important decisions they are going to make in their lives it is my understanding after speaking with officials from the unitedstates department of health and human services that state law does not address the issue of educational standards for counselors in a meaningful way if at all rather private organizations attempt to establish such standards for their own members for example the council on accreditation of services for families and children which is sponsored by the child welfare league of america the national association of homes and services for children and the lutheran social ministry system among others requires its agencies personnel who provide counseling to an expectant parent on the decision to parent the child to transfer custody of the child or to terminate the pregnancy to have a masters degree from an accredited program of social work education or have a bachelors or masters degree in an allied field and are supervised by a person with a masters degree in social work e3 1610 furthermore in a november 1991 letter signed by 21 organizations including the american medical association the american college of physicians and the national association of community health centers the words health care professionals appear seven times on one page in reference to those who would be affected by the counseling restrictions known as the gag rule it is obvious that much of the health care community recognizes the need to require counselors to be qualifled why is it then that situations such as the ones i described earlier continue to exist it is vital that we address this problem now i am not asserting that all family planning clinics receiving title x funds are employing inexperienced counselors however even if only a few clinics are doing so then we are not taking womens health care seriously enough i believe requiring pregnancy counselors to have a professional degree can only enhance the title x program i urge a yes vote on this amendment and a no vote on the waxman seconddegree amendment"], [0.00042498111724853516,

making appropriations for military construction for fiscal year 1994 i would like to thank the chairman and the members of the subcommittee for their hard work in addition i want to commend the staff for their hours of toil and trouble i support this conference report although the measure is not all things to all members i believe we have arrived at an equitable compromise mr hofner has outlined the highlights of the bill so i wont be repetitive i would simply point out again that the bill totals 10 1 billion for fiscal year 1994 is under the presidents request by 729 million is 209 million less than appropriated by the house and is below the subcommittees 602 b allocation while the bill shows a significant increase over fiscal year 1993 funding this is due to base closure expenseswhich account for 30 percent of the billand making up for a dodinitiated construction pause in fiscal year the military construction bill constitutes about 3 percent of dods total budget the majority of the other 97 percent is provided through the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills i believe it is important to note that our subcommittee has worked closely with the armed services committee in order to move the bill forward military construction is an investment program that has significant payback in economic terms in better living and working conditions and in environmental

too long i recently had the privilege of attending the inauguration of nelson mandela as president of south africa frankly that historic day in pretoria was one that i did not expect to witness during my tenure in congress what happened in south africa is relevant to cuba in south africa a closed unrepresentative elite based on race ran a country without regard to the fundamental rights of the majority of its own people in cuba a closed unrepresentative elite based on an ideology runs cuba without regard to the fundamental rights of the majority of the cuban people in the case of south africa the united states together with the international community acted on our indignation of the injustices of apartheid in haiti we have joined an international effort to express our outrage at the situation there by the implementation of comprehensive economic sanctions but when it comes to cuba the same logic that applied to south africa and that applies to haiti is thrown out the window in the case of cuba the united states stands alone in attempting to show its moral outrage at the abuse of an entire country today we should have one standard for authoritarian regimes regardless of whether they are based on an ideology race or result from the removal of a democraticallyelected government that standard should be to declare them illegitimate and to deny them the respect of and

washington post began another editorial attacking a major west virginia project and west virginias senior senator and i think it is time to start calling to account those who want to make these kind of accusations these type of statements and they are not backed up by facts or solid judgment the gist of the washington post editorial is that because the senate included in its part of the transportation appropriation bill dealing with discretionary highway projects a certain amount of money i believe 90 million for corridor h in west virginia most of which yes runs through may district that this is somehow infringing possible house members let us look at the reality of the situation when the transportation appropriation bill left the house there was 299 million of highway projects in it about 108 projects i believe for house members the senate had added to its bill 352 million when the conferees got together they had 299 million of house projects and 352 million of senate projects roughly 600 million they compromised and took the higher senate number 352 million and then divided up and said all right the senate will take 52 percent of the projects and the house will take 48 percent now some might say that sounds unfair because should not the house get at least as much but if you look at other parts of the bill and yes it is a much bigger bill than this one section if you look at other parts of the bill for instance the house received 58 percent of all mass transit projects incidentally we do not do a lot of mass transit in west virginia whereas the senate received 42 percent and so there are different shares throughout the bill so then the senate allocated for its portion 90 million toward corridor h and the house members the house conferees allocated their share some way this is unfair i ask members to look at what the alternative is do they want the senate making decisions on house projects first of all that is question no 1 it was house conferees that allocated the share that they agreed to in the conference the second is that even if we took all 90 million out of the senates portion that does not guarantee one extra nickel for a house member because what happens then i presume is that the senate then allocates its share somewhere else yes i have had members come up to me and say did i get nicked did my project suffer because of this the answer is that in every conference they divide up the application here the house members the house conferees worked out the house allocation and the senate worked out its allocation so i would submit that not one extra nickel is going to a house member even if something should happen to that 90 million i do resent greatly the post somehow claiming that this is a change and that the 90 million is more than could even be obligated in 1 year for the west virginia project the fact of the matter is we do not build too many projects around here by simply appropriating what we obligate in 1 year houston transit system a recent example a highway project in dallas another recent example if you simply appropriated each year what could be obligated each year for a massive project you would have a number of projects coming in at one time for massive amounts of funding this spreads itout and permits us to take care of one project one time and another project another time i also point out i wish the post would get this straight we in west virginia think that yes we are entitled to our fair share and we want everyone else to have theirs we have stood up and voted for 9 billion not million billion for the washington dc suburban maryland and virginia metro system the subway system it is a nice subway system i like tunnels we have lots of tunnels in west virginia they are called coal mines not one train runs through them our transit system is much lower cost and it is called highways but they are vitally important to us as a transit system is important to an urban area i might point out there has been a lot of discussion about this the gentleman from virginia has been named several times in these editorials taking 1 minutes on the floor i just point out that the metro serves his constituents 9 billion dulles airport in northern virginia in that district and lo and behold a cia center for 300 million popped up unannounced on the front pages of the washington post where did that come from we know about 300 million projects and where they are located in west virginia when the post was looking around they said oh my this is a surprise to all of us so these things work out i would urge my colleagues to look at the conference report such as the appropriations report remembering that there may be one section in here we are talking
