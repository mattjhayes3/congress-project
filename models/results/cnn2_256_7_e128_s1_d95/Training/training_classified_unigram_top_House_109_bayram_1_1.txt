and tired of all of the partisan bickering that goes on in this chamber and in our nations capital it should not be about whether it is a democratic idea or a republican idea it ought to be about is it a common sense idea and does it make sense for the people who send us here to be their voice at our nations capital i contend that this republican leadership this republican administration is not leading us down the correct path our country is not on the right track when it comes to our nations finances when it comes to being good stewards of the american peoples tax money as you can see here on the blue dog coalition poster today the united statess national debt is 8 419 336 525 769 for every man woman and child including the children born today every united states citizens share of the national debt is a staggering 28 129 and the sad reality is that during this hour during this blue dog special order during the next 60 minutes this number the unitedstates national debt will go up by approximately 41 666 000 as fiscally conservative democrats we believe the time is now to restore common sense and fiscal discipline to our nations government this 28 129 number each citizens share of the national debt which is what we in the blue dog coalition refer to as the debt tax debt that is one tax that cannot be cut that is one tax that will not go away until we get our nations h5826 cot fiscal house in order now a lot of public opinion surveys say debts and deficits do not matter the republican leadership of this congress says that debts and deficits dont matter well they do matter because we will not be able to meet americas priorities until we first get our fiscal house in order what does it mean it means that our nation is spending our nation is spending a half a billion dollars a day 500 million every 24 hours simply paying interest interest not principal just interest on the national debt folks in my district back home in arkansas they want to build 149 and i do too we need 1 5 billion to complete that interstate that will connect winnipeg canada with the port of new orleans it is a very large amount of money if you look at it another way if we had our nations fiscal house in order we could build that interstate through arkansas with just 3 days interest on the national debt folks in my district want to build i69 and so do i we need 1 6 billion to finish that interstate that will stretch down through arkansas and through much of the midwest from canada all of the way down through texas 1 6 billion sounds like a lot of money and it is a lot of money but put another way we could build that interstate 69 with a little over 3 days interest on the national debt hot springs expressway fourlaning unitedstates highway 167 fourlaning unitedstates highway

ensuring that they get a worldclass education helping the 46 million people that are trying to do the right thing and stay off welfare but are working the jobs with nobenefits the health care access they so desperately need and deserve these are the types of priorities that are going unmet in america because of the lack of fiscal discipline in our nations government it is hard now to believe that we had a balanced budget from 1998 to 2001 because year after year we have record deficits now why should deficits matter i have given you a few reasons others the deficits reduce economic growth we have seen that people lost their jobs under these enormous deficits that we have seen since 2002 some of them are now beginning to find jobs again but they are finding jobs at a much lesser salary than what they were making when they lost their jobs and often times they are finding jobs with few or no benefits these deficits burden our children and grandchildren because it is they"], [0.0, 1.0,

is going to ask me what did you do last year in congress and i am going to say well uncle joe you owe 27 000 to the national debt and the country has borrowed 8 trillion and that is what we all owe and as i stated a couple of hours ago when we were here nicholas john ryan born 3 weeks ago to my brother and his wire carrie he owes 27 000 just like that now that is no way to run a country and when the democrats are talking about balancing the budget and we talk about making some tough decisions and maybe having to go ask a millionaire to maybe pay their fair share in order to reduce the debt and to reduce the annual deficits that we are running we cannot find anyone with any courage on the other side but when they have the opportunity to cut medicaid to cut the free and reduced lunches to cut the budget for child support enforcement agencies in our local communities who go out and try to get money from deadbeat dads that is where they want to get the money from now we are not saying

building dams in iraq roads in iraq schools in iraq training people in iraq training health care workers in iraq and teachers in iraq and the outfit on the other side is cutting free and reduced

for next year yet we cut taxes tonight for millionaires up to the tune of 32 000 per after giving them over 100 000 over the course of the last few years are these good decisions long term for the united states of america because again we do not have surplus money to give back to millionaires in the form of tax cuts we are running deficits and what countries do when they have a deficit is the same thing a family does when they have an annual deficit you have to borrow the money or you have to get out the credit card and that is what this country is doing right now we are putting the future of the united states of america on a credit card and we are asking the next generation the same generation that we are asking to pay double the tuition that they paid 4 or 5 years ago increasing the fees for student loans increasing the burden of taxes on the middle class we are going to also ask that generation to pay the national debt off and to try to somehow close this gap by borrowing the money from the chinese and making sure that they pay back our debts that we are borrowing from the chinese the japanese and the saudi arabians at the same time we are spending 1 5 billion and a half a

bipartisan resolution while i will support it i lament the continuing partisanship which seeks to divide this house in sentiments that ought to see a unified house i lament the fact that in the face of a nation at war that we are not working to bring us together but that effort was not made and it is a failure of leadership in my opinion despite the fact that the senate passed a 9 11 resolution this year by unanimous consent and despite the fact that this body passed a 9 11 resolution last year by a vote of 4026 the republican leadership still attempts to gain political advantage through this measure i think that is unfortunate i am going to support this measure but there are conclusions in the whereas clauses with which i do not agree and which were not necessary for expressing our remembrance and our resolve the majority presents a resolution that includes extraneous and inappropriate divisive selfserving and in my opinion politically motivated language how sad that you would do that in a resolution that seeks to express the unanimous opinion of the representatives of the american people i ask my republican friends what is the point of including a reference in this resolution to controversial legislation that has not even become law specifically i refer to the mention in the house republicans immigration reform bill that bill was controversial in this house that bill has not passed the senate that bill has been rejected essentially by the senate they have come together with a compromise with which the house has not agreed yet we reference in this resolution that which seeks to express our united opinion how sad the reference to this bill which is opposed by even many republicans has no place in a resolution commemorating this solemn occasion not withstanding the importance of that particular issue it is deeply regrettable that on this the fifth anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in our history that the 1aepublican leadership has made political expedience a priority i lament that but i will vote for this because i do not want any confusion among those whom we confront i want no confusion on those we confront i want no confusion by

pay 56 to fill up their f10 pickup truck not because of their indiscretions but because of the indiscretions of the republican majority we have 224 years of history in this country with 42 presidents before this president and they were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion those are the facts that is from the unitedstates department of the treasury it is not the kendrick meek report or the debbie

you misled us when you said government was going to be smaller under your reign you misled us when you said government would be more responsible under your reign it has failed time and time again i have two images in my head mr meek about the real incompetence of the republican majority to be able to run government i have a picture of 11 000 trailers that are sitting in hope arkansai in the mud right now that cost the taxpayers 300 million that are sitting in the mud and we still have people that are not in their homes in the gulf coast that is a government that does not work and what the democrats are saying is that we have solutions to this we are not going to participate in cronyism and the lack of responsibility and responsiveness on the republican side for not providing any oversight to all this then we have the administration come out and say they didnt know anything about it but memos leak out and we find out they knew about it now all of a sudden we get videos that are outsaying that the administration knew exactly what the threat was and what would happen yet still not being able to respond that is the bottom line the people of this country mr meek want a responsive government it doesnt have to be big and in todays society government should not be big but it should be responsive effective effi cient nimble flexible able to change with different scenarios as the scenarios change and as society changes our republican friends and i mean that sincerely because i consider many of them friends they just lack the ideas to try to move the country forward so it is not anything personal it is just that they do not have the ideas to move this ahead what the democrats offer and this is the thing mr meek for us personally definitely in the 30somethings and i know our democratic friends believe profit is not a dirty word profit is good greed is bad profit is good we want more profit because that means more people are going to get hired

excellent job bn behalf of representing his constituents from the great state of arkansas tonight as a fellow blue dog member i want to echo a number of the comments that congressman ross has made because in that 12point program that congressman ross will talk more about i believe lies solutions to the problems facing our nation today solutions that come to the heart of criteria and qualities that all americans i think share those are accountability competence and what kind of representation they want to see in their house of representatives it does not matter what party you are a member of in this great nation of ours accountability and competence are characteristics that americans value throughout our great land in coming to the congress as a new member and becoming a fellow blue dog we have had an opportunity to share and really spend a great deal of time in examining the challenges that our nation finds itself in in getting its fiscal house in order recently the blue dogs in consultation with a lot of research uncovered an unpublicized department of treasury document that made a report that i think most americans unfortunately are unaware of this department of treasury run by this administration using the same tried and true accounting methods that every business in america uses cast new light on the fiscal severity that our nation is facing what some would call a mess this treasury report filed by the bush administration reinforces what the blue dogs have been saying for years one of the startling revelations of this 158page report indicates by the admission of secretary snow that the unitedstates deficit as congressman ross said under current accounting methods in 2005 was more than twice the amount that is being reported as a matter of fact if you do not take into account as congressman ross jut stated the social security surplus our fiscal deficit ladies and gentlemen is over 700 billion today and yes we pay the interest on that debt every day but do not take my word for it look at the financial report of the united states government because it goes on to say that in fact in conjunction with the unitedstates comptroller that there is no way ve can get a clean audit from the books of most of our federal agencies why because no one is being held accountable congressional leaders are not conducting the oversight hearings that we should do as a part of our responsibility as members of congress and so frankly we do not know what the true state of our budget is because so many of these agencies have not been able to provide the proper audits in a letter contained within this report in this report david walker the comptroller general of the united states explains that the model currently used by government provides a potentially unrealistic and misleading picture of the federal deficit its overall performance the financial conditions and what the future outlook will be for future generations of americans to come the financial report makes it very clear that if we got into honest budgeting today that in fact we would find ourselves with a much larger deficit than we have today it goes beyond that to say that in fact if you looked at all 26 agencies in the federal government that is on page 23 here and you asked them for a clean fiscal audit that over twothirds of them would not be able to provide that clean fiscal audit that obviously is not the kind of condition that americans want their federal government to be in that is not the kind of operation and management that provides for the true fiscal accountability and the competency competency remember i said accountability and competency are characteristics that american taxpayers care about they are values and characteristics that really make a difference so what we have today is not just a problem with accountability but it is competence it is not just the problems in the aftermath of katrina and rita with fema but it deals with a budget deficit it deals with a budget deficit that has been compounded by a trade deficit that has grown by 1 400 percent in the last 4 years in 1992 our trade deficit was over 36 billion 2005 our trade deficit has grown to over 670 billion along withit i might add a lot of american jobs that have been exported overseas let me close my comments by telling you that as a new member of congress i had served previously for 24 years in the california legislature i think i did not come back here to washington with any pollyanna view of the world but i also believe very passionately in representative democracy when it works well and when it does not work i have just recently finished reading a book that i want to recommend to americans back home it is called flight club politics it is an accountability of what has occurred in the house of representatives over the last 15 20 years it did not begin with the republicans it involved the democrats in the late 1980s and 1990s and notwithstanding the republicans efforts to pledge to reform the house in 1994 when they took over the fact of the matter is as the evolution of this flight club politics how partisanship is poisoning the house of representatives has unfortunately in my opinion only multiplied the problems that we now have exist today we no longer have a system of checks and balances under the republican leadership during the clinton administration there were over 1 000 subpoenas of the administration e 2030 now one could argue that the congress was doing its part to provide checks and balances unfortunately by comparison under the last 5 years with the republican administration there has been less than 10 subpoenas requested of this administration to hold them accountable regardless of what department or agency you are talking about when you have a view of the world that the only legislation that we can bring to the floor of the house must first pass with a majority of the majority you are taking away the opportunity to have true bipartisan solutions and it is one of the reasons i believe why today in america one of the fastest growing views of voters in america is decline to state or independent so regardless of what party one must be registered under people more and more view themselves as independents what we have to do today and in the future is to restore bipartisanship to this congress the blue dogs believe in that we have to reinforce the opportunities that we dont need a de facto parliamentary system where there is less focus on checks and balances and one party basically runs the entire government those are among the many challenges that we face today my colleagues i am proud to be a member of a group of moderate to conservative democrats who frankly believe that we must first get our fiscal house in order how do we do so we do so with true accountability we do so with competence in terms of how our federal government is run and we do so by ensuring that our house restores

that i so proudly represent and listen to the people and then i do my best to bring their voice back here to the floor of the unitedstates house of representatives the people are telling me that it is

republican idea and i am here to tell you that i believe the people in this country like me are sick and tired of all the partisan bickering that goes on at our nations capital it should not matter if it is a democratic idea or a republican idea in fact the american people are concerned not about petty partisan politics but they are concerned about paying for the high cost of their childrens

medicaid eight out of ten seniors in nursing homes are on medicaid one in five people in my home state of arkansas are on medicaid yet around 1 oclock in the morning on november 18 congress nearly passed the socalled deficit reduction act that would directly and adversely impact the poor the disabled the elderly this bill mandates nearly 50 billion in spending cuts including 11 4 billion in cuts to medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor the disabled the elderly 14 3 billion in cuts to federal student aid programs over 3 billion in cuts to our farm families and over 700 million in cuts to food stamps then the republican leadership turns around and passes 56 billion worth of tax cuts 50 billion in spending cuts 56 billion in tax cuts only in washington do you add 6 billion to the nations debt and call it the deficit reduction act i will never stop fighting for the conservative smalltown values that i was raised on and still believe in and i cannot help but reflect on one of the memory verses that i learned growing up at midway united methodist church just outside prescott arkansas it is from matthew 25 40 and it goes like this i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me mr speaker the idea of cutting programs that would negatively impact the poorest among u does not resonate with the principles on which this country was founded these budget cuts are indicative of misguided priorities and do not reflect the values i learned growing up in places like emmet prescott and hope arkansas

poorest among us it is called the blue dog 12point plan it is 12 simple points quite frankly that if irpplemented would truly restore some fiscal discipline and common sense to our nations government

land 8 137 trillion in debt that is very important for a lot of reasons not the least of which is our nation today the first 500 million we collect every day in taxes from taxpayers does not go to better roads better education better health care it simply goes to pay interest to pay interest on the national debt it is not getting any better in fact our nation is borrowing another 907 million

this additional funding that we are requesting is measured it is responsible it is the difference between what aphis tell us they need to eradicate invasive species and what this bill contains my good friend on the other side of the aisle calls this a new york issue this is not a new york issue this is across the country and it addresses not only the asian longhorned beetle but the emerald ash borer the sudden death oak disease the cactus moth that is in the gulf region the boll weevil that is in the south and has destroyed a lot of the cotton industry and again this is not what we are requesting it is what the professionals are requesting if we are able to stop it in new york or chicago chicago has practically eradicated the asian longhorned beetle believe me you do not want this moving across the country it is a terrible terrible bug i have got one right here and it is only about an inch long with white spots on it it does not look that dangerous but if it gets into a tree it will completely destroy the tree it first appeared in greenpoint brooklyn in my district and we did not detect it and literally we had to chop down every single tree in a park and throughout the neighborhood we are now trying to contain it and to keep it out of central park it has moved into new jersey if we are able to contain it in chicago and new jersey and new york then you will not have this problem again we are not just talking about the asian longhorned beetle we are talking about all invasive species and it is the amount that is requested by the professionals in the animal and plant health inspection service so this is a responsible bill regrettably in new york we have had to chop down over 4 000 trees 27 000 trees have been chopped down across the country and this is really an unacceptable price to pay and that is why we need to pass this amendment which will provide more funding to fight these invasive species i tell you it is a responsible request we are just backing up what the agency is asking for and this is a national problem if we are able to contain it in chicago and new jersey then you will not have the problem and as i said it also funds all of the other areas such as the sudden oak death and the emerald ash borer i yield the remainder of my time to my colleague and friend from new york who has worked so hard on this issue and it is so critical to all of new york city and state but to your states too"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i move to strike the last word i rise in support of the weinerschwarz amendment i want to thank my colleague from new york for all his hard work on this important issue on attacking invasive species many people wonder why members of the new york city delegation would be up here on the agricultural bill but the issue of invasive species is a serious one for members from rural suburban and urban areas as well for new york city the pest in question is the asian longhorned beetle and quite frankly if the asian longhorned beetle were this big we would not be having this debate right now we would all be putting more than 48 million per year towards eradicating it but it is much smaller it is about oneandahalf inches to 2 inches in length it has been in queens county since 1999 where i represent the asian longhorned beetle has had devastating effects on trees in my home county of queens but also of brooklyn the bronx manhattan as well as parts of chicago and new jersey i know this pest has been depriving the residents of my constituency in my district of precious shade green space and natural beauty provided by a variety of trees this issue is particularly serious in an area where trees and shades are at a premium in the county of queens we have lost almost half of the trees that have been lost in new york city but besides attacking urban area trees scientists have stated that the asian longhorned beetle is a real threat to the hardwood trees of america and if left unchecked this pest could be more threatening to our nations trees and forests than the dutch elm disease the gypsy moth caterpillar the chestnut blight combined this beetle would be devastating to our timber industry but let me go to our homes and to the breakfast table this invasive species can have a direct impact on the maple syrup industry here in america imagine pancakes without real maple syrup that is what this bug represents to america right now on this point i want to thank again the chair and the ranking member for including report language in this bill recognizing the real threat of the asian longhorned beetle the report states the asian longhorned beetle threatens all hardwood trees and is of great concern to the northeast particularly in new york and new jersey when this pest was first discovered i called for the assistance of my colleagues in this chamber and you all responded i want to acknowledge the great work of thenchairman skeen and now chairman bonilla and thenranking member kaptur and now ranking member delauro in working with me and the city of new york to try to address this issue i remember visiting the heinz family of ridgewood queens who lost some of their precious trees to this pest in 1999 due to our hard work here in washington we were able to fund investigators who searched the trees to look for the beetle and worked towards eliminating the problem in this particular neighborhood we were able to replace those trees green space and trees are a vital component to the quality of life of my constituents both in queens and the bronx and all the outer boroughs including manhattan we can fight this invasive species and other pests that plague our country like the emerald ash borer sudden oak death cactus moth and boll weevil by passing this weinerschwarz amendment today in addition to their past support for battling the beetle i also want to thank chairman bonilla and ranking member delauro for including a provision in their bill granting the secretary of the usda discretion to use commodity credit corporation funds to combat the beetle while this provision is important it cannot replace the need for this amendment as over the past several years omb has

know that every year they are given i believe an inadequate allocation and that they both wish that they could do more to meet our foreign assistance priorities but i am compelled to come to the floor

than the number of people who die from war famine terrorism or natural disasters each year combined that is really quite mindboggling what is worse each of these three diseases is completely completely preventible and treatable and in the case of tuberculosis and malaria they can be completely cured so while we have begun to focus our efforts and funding with regard to this pandemic i believe that we cannot afford to drag our feet and just let 6 million people die like this year after year when do we draw the line and say enough is enough and we are going to escalate our efforts and put more resources into this pandemic we cannot in good conscience ignore this human tragedy that unfolds around us each and every day we must act and we must act in a bold fashion that is why today i am offering an amendment to add 600 million in emergency funding to the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria adding to the 400 million already in the bill and bringing our total contribution to 1 billion unfortunately last week 100 million was actually cut from the global fund in the laborhhs bill by this body the global fund is one of the most powerful tools that we have as an international community to combat these three diseases in fact we created the framework for the global fund back in 2000 with the passage of the global aids and tuberculosis relief act of 2000 which was signed into law by president clinton e 1645 and we provided the very first contribution in 2001 to help attract further financing from other donor nations today the global fund is a model for what the future of international development may look like designed strictly as a financing instrument the global fund seeks to attract manage leverage and disburse funding to support locallydriven strategies to combat aids tuberculosis and malaria to date the global fund has approved 3 4 billion for over 300 grants in 127 countries however this year the global fund faces one of its biggest challenges renewing over the 1 8 billion in existing grant agreements and approving upwards of 1 billion in new contracts and this is still not enough with the renewing of these contracts there is just not enough money without increased support from the united states and other donor nations the fund may be forced to cut back on funding new grants and worse may be forced to cut crucial

africa combat aids tb and malaria with a sizable contribution going to the global fund and with the upcoming g8 summit taking place in scotland next week and with the british prime ministers focus on a huge new development initiative for africa the united states can and must do more by providing 600 million in emergency funding my amendment would take that first step because my amendment is an emergency spending request it will exceed the foreign operations subcommittees 302 b allocation and therefore i know that that ig subject to a point of order but i would hope that given the gravity of

infrastructure that we need how can we expect them to be professionals if we dont treat them like professionals if we dont invest in the infrastructure that is so desperately needed we were there looking at their sensor systems and it was a bipartisan group from the interparliamentary group we looked at not just the physical layout of the station but the condition of their vehicles they need vehicles the vehicles the technology that they were using the cameras that they were monitoring were over 15 years old the sensors were 20 years old that is why consistently the message has been at

probably less than 10 percent much less than 10 percent in one of the hearings that we were talking about we were concerned about a range in yuma arizona it seemed like it was an area that needed

ones yesterday the republican leaders of congress held a press conference which was kind of pathetic where they said pretty please we dofht care about your really high profits but weve heard there might be some gouging going on and you better stop that and pretty please use some of your profits to build refineries no it doesnt fit their business model they are making money hand over fist their production end where they pump the stuff out of the ground their profits are only up a measly 50 percent on the distribution end they are only up 5 percent the retailers are up 2 percent the republicans the week before last did adopt some price gouging legislation who did they target the refiners whose profits are up 500 percent no the companies who are pulling it out of the ground whose profits are up 50 percent no even the distributors who are up 5 percent not a"], [0.24293982982635498, 0.742939829826355, 1, "i yield myself the balance of my time one of the major reasons why we are opposing this bill is because of the process clearly a bill is supposed to be brought to this floor when it has overwhelming support when it is a simple bill naming a post office having a stamp declaring mothersas being essential for parenthood things that republicans and democrats can look up at the scoreboard and see that we have 435 members or close to it supporting it how can anyone perceive as one of the members on the other side said the most important trade legislation that we ever had will be put on just for 40 minutes debate the qualities that exist in the english bill we have been able to see some loopholes he and i would want to work together to close those loopholes all the members of the committee on ways and means feels the same way about trying to do some thing to contain the overreaching of china what makes the other side believe that we democrats are not entitled to participate in the substantive nature of sensitive complex legislation putting this on the suspension calendar in my opinion is an insult to members on both sides of the aisle and is an insult to those people who oversight what we do because the suspension calendar means that we never thought that they would ever have a problem with it and that is why we did not share what is in this bill i also think that it is really unfair to have the members of congress to believe that this bill comes to the floor because of its importance and therefore has to be passed on the suspension calendar we have plenty of time to work in the committee on ways and means in dealing with this so that we can be proud that we do not have a range i bill or an english bill or a republican bill or a democratic bill the pride should come when we have a congressional bill which we can say both sides have an opportunity to hear witnesses to see what the impact is going to be whether it is going to work or not work to see whether those who have fought to put checks on china feel satisfied that we have done it and to be able to say to foreigners that we may have differences among ourselves political differences but when it comes to trade policy we speak with one voice the flag is up and we speak for the united states of america so i recognize how important it is to pass the drcafta bill i recognize that there is a problem because democrats were not involved and republicans cannot get the votes but i do not know how many suspension bills they are going to bring in as an excuse to get members to say i got them to talk about china and therefore i am going to vote for cafta it is not enough to talk about china and the problems that we face what we should be doing is bringing these issues up in the committee that has jurisdiction and we are so proud of it and to make certain that the best we can is to have this as a bipartisan effort on both sides so this is not the first time that the committees of jurisdiction have had to have members bypassed in terms of their input bypassed in terms of the ability to have amendments and bypassed in teims of saying that we have to find some way to find some bill that we can get bipartisanship on it the vehicle to do this normally from the record of the congress are the suspension bills but trade bills should not be on the suspension calendar"], [0.27869218587875366, 0.7786921858787537, 1, "i yield myself some additional time to simply say i appreciate what the gentleman from texas said in closing which is to focus on the tenants i think it is important that we continue to pay attention to housing authorities too often people slip into the mistake of equating homeownership with homes homeownership is very important yes to the sense that people are economically and other ways able to own homes that is a good thing but a large number of lowincome people through a variety of reasons economic and others are not going to owfi homes and we ought to be clear that it is the right of people to a home that we want to work for or at least the ability of people to have a decent home in many cases that will be homeownership but in some cases it will not be and we want to make it very clear as far as the public sector is concerned we ought to have the same obligation to help people make the most out of their home whether they are tenants or owners this is an example of how we do that so i thank the gentleman i
