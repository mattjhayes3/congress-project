appeals of decisions of the virgin islands supreme court to the unitedstates supreme court i want to begin by thanking the chairman and ranking member of the committee on the judiciary and their staff for working together in a bipartisan way to swiftly report h r 6116 and bring it to the house floor today on behalf of the people of the virgin islands i want to say thank you to chairman smith and ranking member conyers as well as to my colleagues congressman coble and congressman scott who are managing the bill on the floor today it was just 5 months ago that i had the pleasure of joining the elected leaders of the virgin islands at a ceremony to celebrate the virgin islands supreme court reaching a historic milestone specifically the occasion was to receive the report from the judicial council of the third circuit regarding their review of the virgin island supreme court during its first 5 years as required by law which authorized the virgin islands to create a local appellate court the third circuit report concluded that the unitedstates virgin islands supreme court developed sufficient institutional traditions to justify direct review of its final decisions by the united states supreme court and urged congress to enact legislation providing that the supreme court of the unitedstates virgin islands enjoy the same relationship with the unitedstates supreme court as the highest court of any state today the house will take the first step in making the virgin islands supreme court just like every other high court in the states and territories this is just one more step on the journey for further local selfgovernance which was begun in 1984 when my predecessor former delegate to congress ron de lugo amended the virgin islands 1954 organic act to allow for the creation of an appellate court chartered under local law while it took another 20 years for virgin islands act no 6687 to be signed into law by thengovernor charles w turnbull and 2 more years for a chief justice and two associate justices to be nominated and confirmed and for the supreme court to formally accept appellate jurisdiction chief justice hodge and associate justices cabret and swan are to be commended for the work they did to earn the recommendation of the third circuits judicial council for appeals of their decisions to go directly to the unitedstates supreme court in doing so they are following our sister territory of guam which was the last supreme court to gain direct appeals of their decisions to the unitedstates supreme court over these past 5 years the virgin islands supreme court has issued opinions on such wideranging cases as whether and when a judge could be disciplined to affirming in a landmark ruling that women are not property by my staffs unofficial count among the courts many accomplishments is the issuance of over 180 published opinions since 2007 other noteworthy accomplishments include making several structural reforms in the areas of attorney admissions to the virgin islands bar discipline procedures and mandating new requirements for continuing legal education courses for all active members of the virgin islands bar association i had the pleasure of joining chief justice hodge and associate justices cabret and swan at their official swearingin ceremony in 2006 at that time i focused my remarks on the historic nature of the occasion as well as the personal relationships i share with each of the individual justices with all that they have accomplished over the short time that this court has been in existence all virgin islanders will look back on this time with great pride and gratitude for the way in which they laid the foundation for appellate jurisprudence in the territory that is second to none while it took more than 20 years after the laws authorizing us to establish a local appellate court and while we are the last unitedstates territory to do so it is more than fitting that we are on the verge of accomplishing the final goal of

impoundments the pending legislation is not perfect in these respects in fact there are some flaws which need to be worked out further i also believe there are more appropriate ways to gain enactment of the provisions of h r 2273 which this amendment reflects in fact we should all note that the bill has already passed the house and been sent to the other body where senators are actually working to achieve a bipartisan agreement i will however vote for this amendment because i have long supported many of the concepts embodied in it including active oversight of coal ash impoundments and the promotion of the beneficial reuse of coal ash for activities like road building which my colleague from west virginia has already well demonstrated so as i conclude i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and i join in thanking my colleague from west virginia for bringing it to us today and i praise him for his consistency because he came to me early on in our t i markup process to have this introduced in committee"], [0.7041146755218506, 0.2958853244781494, 1, "madam president i feel compelled to come to the floor this evening to refute some of the arguments that have been made by some of my colleagues points that are important for the american people to understand points that if not clarified could lead to a misunderstanding lead to resentment which is misplaced one of the points i have heard made this evening by one of my colleagues is that the debt limit issue has never been held hostage quite like it has now i am not quite sure what was meant by this but i do want to clarify this point if someone had held this hostage before on any of the dozens and dozens of times the debt limit has been raised over the course of many years maybe it would have been a good thing maybe it would be a good thing for us not to be dealing with right now a national debt that has almost reached 15 trillion maybe we should consider the fact that those who are being held hostage are those who will one day have to repay this debt considering that some of those people are not yet here because they have yet to be born and in some instances their parents have yet to meet we have to ask the question whether they are being held hostage themselvesheld hostage to a government that always demands more money so it can exercise more power over us and as it acquires more power exercises more of that over usthus restricting our libertyit demands more money as it acquires more money it exercises more power and the process perpetuates itself this is how we get to the point where we are almost 15 trillion in debt this is how we get to the point where the american people are being held hostage so if this process has not been held up in the past then shame on those who could have held it up but did not it is incumbent upon us who serve here and now to represent those who are sometimes underrepresented to represent those most vulnerable members of society who are not yet old enough to vote or not yet born this is a multigenerational problem it is a multigenerational obligation we are taking upon our entire country in connection with this debate so if my colleague who made this point just about half an hour ago meant that we should never have vigorous aggressive debate and discussion over whether it is a good idea to take on 2 5 trillion in new debt in one fell swoop perhaps we should revisit that assumption perhaps we ought to secondguess ourselves just a little bit more than we have in recent decades lest we hold hostage an entire generation another point that was made by that same colleague is that republicans have put forward plans to challenge to undermine to bring about immediate cuts to social security and medicare this simply is not true quite to the contrary the cut cap and balance actof which i was the lead sponsor in the senate before it was introduced in the house by my friend jason chaffetz where it was later passedcut cap and balance act actually protected social security and medicare it bolstered it strengthened those programs so it is utterly false and i believe disingenuous for anyone to argue that proposalor any other that i am aware of for that matterwould bring about cuts to social security and medicare this is not the point of this legislation quite to the contrary the point of this legislation is to protect what we need to do through the unitedstates government whether you are someone who would describe himself as a conservative and perhaps most concerned about national defense or whether you are perhaps more liberal and you are most concerned about protecting our entitlement programs you ought to agree with the principles underlying the cut cap and balance approach with the fact that we need a balanced budget amendment because if we do not put these measures in place now if we do not agree now that we need to restrict our borrowing authority every one of those programs will be jeopardized as we reach the mathematical the economic borrowing capacity of the unitedstates government the more we borrow the more we run into the risk that those who lend us money those who buy our unitedstates treasurys will one day be unwilling to lend us more money at least not without additional interest payments we could very quickly go from spending about 250 billion a year in interest as we now are to spending something much closer to 1 trillion a year in interest based on just a few interest rate points as that goes up our ability to fund everything goes down in closing it is important to point out that what is being requested here is the largest debt limit increase in american historyabout 2 5 trillion unprecedented the idea here is to give the unitedstates congress enough borrowing power to take us almost 2 years down the road two years by the way is roughly the amount of time that has elapsed since the democrats in the senate even introduced a budget one has to ask why extend the debt limit for such a long period of time the president gave us the answer the other day he wants to insulate himself from the political process he wants to make it not a political issue political issues are themselves things the voters are concerned aboutas well they should bebecause voters pay taxes voters are affected by decisions we make we need to have voters connected not disconnected from this process we need to act now but we need to act responsibly the only way to do that is to raise the debt limit only after we pass the balanced budget amendment thank you madam president"],

was grabbed by a handful of executives and these disclosures are even more important because these companies will not be subject to the sayonpay rules under the financial reform legislation passed and signed into law just last year and weve already seen from the experience on sayonpay that there remain real abuses of executive compensation even though many companies have changed their practices and have made them more transparent because they are worried about putting their pay practices to a vote of the shareholders they fear disapproval and theyve changed their practices but even with that about 2 percentwhich is actually a pretty big numberget turned down and they all get turned down for pretty much the same reasons there is no connection between pay and performance there are poor pay practices like longterm benefits without any kind of a performance measure there are bonuses that were way too easy to achieve that the bar was set very very low there are performance measures that

especially appreciate that the final version of the bill includes a modified version of the merkley amendment on afghanistan that was approved by the united states senate but unfortunately the final product contains policies that i simply cannot support the bill increases fundingbeyond the pentagons requestfor several programs including a new missile defense base on the east coast the bill also denies the pentagon the opportunity to save money with its failure to include a cut to the contractor comp cap its failure to include a round of base closures and its failure to implement endstrength troop reductions even though we are supposedly ending our involvement in two wars at a time when congress is being asked to look for savings even considering cutting vital programs like social security it is unconscionable to me that we would continue to mandate wasteful funding that the military has said it does not need and does not want how can we look into the eyes of a senior citizen who is living off of social security and tell him that his costofliving adjustment will be smaller so that we can buy weapons that the military doesnt even want also very troubling to me is that this bill continues to prevent the president from fulfilling his commitment to close the guantanamo bay prison camp by imposing unnecessary and illadvised transfer restrictions i am proud to serve as the cochair of the tom lantos human rights commission we constantly and appropriately criticize other countries for their lack of transparency and adherence to the rule of law the continued existence of guantanamo undermines our standing around the world the president has said repeatedly that he wants to close guantanamo there is broad bipartisan support among national security experts for him to do so congress just needs to get out of the way while i support a great deal of this bill especially programs and services for our veterans and military retirees i cannot support a bill this large when we are in the middle of negotiations on the socalled fiscal cliff the pentagon is more willing than this congress to look at the defense budget and make thoughtful but significant reductions this bill continues to show that when it comes to defense spending congress is part of the problem not part of the solution i would like to insert into the record an article that appeared in todays washington post by walter pincus entitled military funds to spare in which he quotes secretary of defense panetta in a speech he said that the committees here in the congress had diverted about 74 billion of what we asked for in savings in our proposed budget to the congress and they diverted them to other areas that frankly we dont need that is from the secretary of defense i would also like to insert into the record a letter to the president that was sent to members of congress as well urging that he veto the national defense authorization act because it extends restrictions on transferring detainees out of the guantanamo prison let me just conclude my opening here by saying that i want a defense second to none i believe that we need to do whatever we need to do to protect the citizens of this country but just throwing more money at the pentagon doesnt mean that youre getting a stronger defense expanding the bloat and the waste in the pentagon does nothing to enhance our national security we need a new definition of national security one that includes things like jobs for our citizens one that includes access to a good quality education one that includes a strong infrastructure one that includes good health care for everybody in this country an end to homelessness and an end to hunger in the united states of america i say this because after we debate this rule were going to take up another rule dealing with the socalled plan b and plan c and maybe theres a plan d and a plan e who knows what is particularly troublesome to me is that in the tax version of what the republicans are going to bring to the floor later it includes things like ending programs that benefit middleincome families and poor families under their proposal 25 million working families with tens of millions of children will pay an average of 1 000 more in taxes thats not fair that undermines the economic security of that family under their proposal 11 million families would lose a tax credit that helps pay for college how is that in our security were told time and time again by all of the experts that in order for us to continue to be an economic global power we need a welleducated workforce so what are they proposing that 11 million families lose their tax credits to help pay for college fifty million seniors and other medicare enrollees health care would be jeopardized as doctors face a 27 percent cut in medicare payments under this proposal thats just the tax version of what theyre proposing we havent even gotten to what theyre proposing in terms of spending cuts so here we are talking about a defense authorization act that is more money than our pentagon wants that is more money than our joint chiefs of staff want that is more money than the secretary of defense wants as were doing this were telling the american people that we have to lower your costofliving adjustment on social security that we have to lower your quality of health care that we have to cut some money from housing programs that we have to cut snap and food stamps so that you wont have enough to eat this is crazy this is crazy so yes were all for a military and a

sworn to do what the law requires them to do obey the orders of the commander in chief the troops are doing their duty by refusing to get congressional authorization for military action in libya it appears that their commander in chief is not the constitution was designed to be a check on the power of our government hence the term enumerated powers each of the three branches has very limited powers with congress having its own unique role and powers one of which an important one of which is the power to declare war my focus this morning will be on the abrogation of the constitutional and statutorial responsibility by the president in regard to his actions on libya in other words the authorization to use military force is given to the president by this body and none other and it is in accordance with our constitution that we are here asserting our sworn constitutional duty and telling the president he does not have the support nor the authority that he claims to have in order to continue military operations in libya i have often urged people to read orwells book 1984 because the language used by president obama in particular on the libya issue to muddy the waters is so reminiscent of the language used in that book about a country where the government controls everything including the minds of the people partly by the use of language that is completely distorted i have read the letter that president obama sent to congress he should have come in person to make his case but even then i doubt we would agree to continue operations in libya the letter that the

armed forces and before i address the mission itself i first applaud their willingness to sacrifice so much for their fellow americans a careful review of the presidents case for support of his actions in libya leads me to this sobering but firm conclusion the presidents use of force in libya is unwise and it is unconstitutional the level of military resources being employed both in personnel and equipment the amount of ordnance delivered and the damage inflicted constitute acts of war at the very minimum they meet the definition of hostilities under the war powers resolution yet not one of the three criteria delineated in the war powers resolution that would justify his action has been met there has been no declaration of war there has been no statutory authority issued there has been no evidence that an attack on american forces was imminent or had occurred now if a tomahawk missile was launched into any american city whether los angeles chicago or even my home city of virginia beach would that not meet our definition of hostilities absolutely it would now this is the pivotal issue the military force being directed toward libya easily triggers the definition of hostilities the legal opinion upon which the administration stakes the legitimacy of its actions in libya is thinner than the paper on which it is written it is not based on law but something that he refers to as the national interest a term that the president in his wisdom believes he can solely define himself his office of legal counsel concluded that president obama could rely on his constitutional power to safeguard the national interest by directing the anticipated military operations in libya which were limited in their nature scope and duration listen carefully here without prior congressional authorization disregarding the legal opinions of the pentagons general counsel and the acting head of the justice departments office of legal counsel both of whom told the white house they believed that the militarys operations in libya amounted to hostilities the president plowed ahead a presidents opinion of the war powers resolution does not negate its authority though required by law there was no check there was no balance even the broadest interpretation of article i section 8 cannot corral the interpretation held by the president of his unilateral right to engage
