percentplus of americans who support commonsense reforms to stop gun violence like background checks and keeping guns away from terrorists while the recent tragedy in orlandoa tragedy that claimed 49 innocent livessparked the sitin there have been too many victims of gun violence throughout our country for too many years in my district in 2012 we suffered a large campus mass shooting these people were trying to get an education they were studying to become nurses because they wanted to help people but their lives were cut too short by gun violence a man with a semiautomatic weapon killed

violence let me remember some of the victims of gun violence in my own community once again in my district for example there were 89 gun deaths in 2015 what is worse many of these were children since july 2009 nearly 50 students in the oakland unified school district have been slain let me be clear that is 50 kids why isnt the speaker allowing us to do anything about this just this past weekend in my community four people were gunned down in two separate incidents every day in my community and places around this country this senseless violence continues how can house republicans just ignore this bloodshed let me talk about a few additional victims so you can just understand their lives and share the horror that cut their loves so short davon ellis this is davon davon was a star football

waiting period to purchase a gun there are no restrictions on assault weapons any individual can take advantage of the lack of gun violence prevention laws in indiana and they do individuals purchase firearms at gun shows with no background checks at all and drive them back to chicago across the state line where they wind up on our city streets no state can address the gun violence epidemic alone

ears and cause it to be extinct this new approach to opioids is part of that this bill has no mandatory minimums as we take the steps today which will allow us to engage in discussions with the senate so that we may soon send a bill to the president for his signature i am pleased of the progress that has been made i can only hope that our work on sentencing reduction prison reform and juvenile justice will have the same kind of impetus and will wind up on the presidents desk that is the vision i believe of many republicans and democrats in and out of this house as well it is the vision of the presidents but more importantly it is the vision of suffering families who do not have their loved ones with them the reason we must work together is that the leading killer of americans today which is drug overdose started first by prescription use in many instances between 2000 and 2014 almost half a million people died from drug overdoses that is a startling number in 2014 alone more than 47 000 people died of drug overdoses the largest percentage of overdose deaths in 2014 was attributed to opioids like prescription painkillers methadone morphine and heroin specifically 28 647 people overdosed and died because of an opioid in 2014 this is an emergency and it is a combination of prescription painkillers and heroin prescription painkillers abuse is the strongest risk for the future use of heroin that is our athletes or those who have had surgeryjust everyday americans who find themselves caught in the trap of addiction approximately three out of four new heroin users report that their use began with the abuse of prescription drugs heroin use becomes appealing to those who are addicted to prescription drugs because it is cheaper and easier to obtain and due to its potency heroin use tends to lead to addiction we know that from the 1980s and 1990s with crack cocaine in that crack was a more potent extraction of cocaine and we saw many of those individuals not get treatment they actually only got incarceration heroin addiction is often deadly just as crack cocaine was in leading to overdose or to other chronic diseases the rate at which the occurrence of heroin overdose deaths has increased is cause for alarm in the 4 years between 2010 and 2014 heroin overdoses more than tripled in 2013 11 million people admitted to the improper use of prescription painkillers and therefore were at a heightened risk of becoming addicted that is why we have worked together this week on legislation to put together something like an omnibus in order to reduce the risks of addiction and to fund appropriate treatment responses for those who abuse these drugs the bill that was passed yesterday reflects the strategy by proposing to establish a grant program to be administered by the department of justice to assist states and local governments it is important to note these statistics the rate of deaths from heroin overdoses that account from the white population saw a 267 percent increase between 2010 and 2014 in african americans there was an increase of 213 percent in 2010 to 2014 in hispanics there was a 137 percent increase from 2010 to 2014 and in native americans there was a 236 percent increase no aspect of american life has been uninfluenced by the devastation of heroin overdoses and deathsmany of it impacting families whose young bright talented athletic and otherwise young people have fallen victim to this this grant program is extremely helpful for which i am very pleased because it deals with monitoring the prescription drugs and it deals with matching those who are committed to working with police officers it is truly an important bill let me close by saying that we must have money to support all of this and i am hoping that this will not be the last stop we will make i rise in support of this amendment to s 524 the comprehensive addiction and recovery act this week the house adopted a number of bills

assist states and local governments particularly by helping criminal justice agencies to tackle the opioid problem from a variety of angles this bill included in this amendment encourages the development of alternatives to incarceration that provide treatment as a solution to the underlying motivation for criminal behavior or conduct associated with mental disorders we must make our best efforts to prevent individuals from moving from painkillers to heroin by making treatment for addicts more accessible by encouraging the use of evidencebased programs such as medicationassisted treatment lifesaving overdose reversal drugs like naloxone are most valuable in the hands of trained individuals who regularly come in contact with individuals who are prone to drug overdoses this legislation will increase the use and availability of naloxone and other overdose reversal drugs to first responders addiction is a disease that affects the brain and eventually changes the behavior of addicts causing them to experience mental health issues and encounter legal problems treatment is the most reasonable and effective approach to diverting these individuals away from homelessness and prison there are also specific provisions we have proposed that allow for a wide range of services to be offered to our veterans who tend to suffer from mental health issues and addiction i support this legislation because i believe that it will help save lives and prevent and treat opioid addiction the approach congress is taking with the crisis of heroin and other opioids is thoughtful and comprehensive i hope it signals a departure from some of the failed approaches concerning other drug crises in the past for instance our response to the surge in crack cocaine in the 1980s was to enact draconian mandatory minimum penalties with vastly disparate treatment for crack and powder cocaine at that time we in congress took action that we are still trying to rectify at one point more than 80 of the defendants sentenced for crack offenses were african american despite the fact that more than 66 of crack users are white or hispanic as we work on other legislation to address the enforcement and sentencing disparities related to the crack issue we must reexamine our approach to that and other drug issues while law enforcement has an appropriate role and the bills recognize that the bills we adopted this week and that we put forth as an amendment to the senate bill today reflect a broader strategy that reflects the fact that this is an addiction issue accordingly we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory minimums but we are funding antiaddiction mechanisms such as treatment alternatives to incarceration we are not adding to mass incarcerationwith all of the related and devastating collateral consequencesbut instead we are incentivizing state and local governments to prevent treat and heal that is what we should be doing and that is what we should have done for crack and cocaine addicts with that history in mind and with the chance to take smarter and more effective steps now i look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the houseand in

are going to speak to talk about the budget of the united states federal government i rise this afternoon after our legislative business for the day because it is the concern of many of usand perhaps it is the concern of all of us who ran for office who got elected who honorably serve in this bodyto sayto make sure perhapsthat our priorities are in order and if you simply look at any number of debt clocks that run on all kinds of different web sites including one that continues live in my office you see perhapsi hope it is clear to you mr speakerthat our priorities are not in order we are over 18 trillion in debt as i take the microphone right now that is not the half of it over the next several decades we are scheduled to have over 100 trillion in debt and that is not acceptable in fact i cant think of too many things that are more immoral than the presentday majority than our presentday citizens leaving this burden to future citizens people who do not yet exist talk about taxation without representation but that is what we are faced with that is what we do every day around here when our budget is not in balance and our priorities remain out of order to be clear we are able to get to this point as very few other countries are because of the fact we are the worlds reserve currency because of the fact that we continue to be able to print money and because of the fact that despite all our problems when compared in a relative fashion to all the other countries of the world we simply arent as bad yet but over time that can very easily change the solution to this isnt all that complicated we have to stop spending more than we take in we have to keep growing our economy we have to simplify our tax code so that it can actually generate more revenue than it is doing right now of course we have to reform what is driving the debt and that is our spending that is what the republicansin this chamber at leastare trying to achieve we are trying to put our priorities back in balance washington doesnt have a revenue problem washington has a spending problem in terms of revenue we take in over 2 trillion a yearand these are rough figuresbut we spend generally over 3 trillion that is simply not sustainable that simply cant go on if we are to have any credibility on this issue and if we are going to remain a strong country best of nations in the 21st century and continue to win so the house budget committee and specifically the republicans on the house budget committee are about getting our priorities in order and frankly to our credit for the last 4 years we have done just that every year since 2010 we have proposed balanced budgets that if followed would have led us on a path to prosperity would have made it clear that we are best of class in the world again and the best investment going all we had to do is take the steps outlined in that budget and it would have become so this year we are going to try again we are going to balance this budget we are going to have a markup in a week or so we are going to propose and present ideas to the american public most of these ideas they have seen before over the last 4 years there may be some new ones we are still writing our budget we are still taking input from members and nonmembers alike but one thing the american people can count on it will be an honest budget it will be credible it will balance and it will fulfill the promise we explicitly and implicitly made over and again to future generations that their generation will be better off than the generation before it isnt that what we are all about isnt that what we are supposed to be about but as i speak with you here today the facts tell a different story in fact the current generation is the first one in american history that is destined and will by any objective measure leave the next one worse off it has never happened before in american history it is happening now i know several of us on the budget committee refuse to let that happen on our watch and so we come to you tonight with several ideas i want to first recognize a very good friend of mine a professional who came from the private sector and practiced accounting as a certified public accountant for over 25 years he has added tremendous value to all the work we are doing on the budget committee aside from budget issues he is a tremendous asset to nearly every

acts on unitedstates soil this bill a version of which passed the senate unanimously would correct misinterpretations of previous legislation and lower court decisions and empower survivors and families of the victims of international terrorism to seek a measure of justice through our civil court system this bill is needed because both the congress and the executive have affirmed that civil litigation against terror sponsors including governments can have an important deterrent effect this bill is also mindful of the concerns some have about its possible effect on sovereign immunity for that reason it is narrowly focused and applies only to attacks committed on unitedstates soil that harm unitedstates nationals the attacks of 9111 were roundly condemned by people and governments around the world so this bill is needed not just for the families of those who died in new york and at the pentagon and in pennsylvania but it is needed by people around the world we know we lost roughly 3 000 people on 9111 but thousands and thousands more have died since the attacks because of the diseases that they now have because of being exposed to the toxins down at ground zero now they are predicting that roughly 15 people a day are concerned because cancer is now in their bodies from the exposure so our people are still suffering fifteen years is a long time to wait this bill is

citizens do not have a vote in the government that makes the national laws which affect their daily lives if puerto rico desires statehood i cannot identify any moral basis upon which congress could decline that petition especially in light of the enormous contribution that island residents have made in our armed forces over generations how could the unitedstates government a champion of democracy and selfdetermination around the world disregard those principles with respect to its own citizens without losing credibility at home and abroad the second reason that statehood is in the national interest is economic last year the gao published a report about the fiscal impact of statehood on the federal government the report confirms that statehood will enhance quality of life in puerto rico but it also alleviates any concern that statehood would have an adverse impact on the unitedstates treasury as the gao explains new federal outlays to puerto rico would be significantly counterbalanced by new federal revenues generated from the island the truth is this this nation will benefit when puerto ricos economic economy is strong when its residents do not need to move to the states to achieve their dreams or vote for their national leaders when individuals in businesses on the island flourish and when the corporate and individual tax base expands the unitedstates stands
