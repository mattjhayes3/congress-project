really willing to balance the budget then even a constitutional amendment isnt going to do a bit of good back in the sixties new york city was operating under a legal requirement that its budget be balanced what happened accounting sophistry rose to a fine art still a constitutional amendment might do some good but it should be the right kind of amendment we should not clutter up our constitution with complicated economic formulas there is a difference between our founding document and the federal register the strength of that document lies in large measure in its simplicity we should keep our constitution as simple as possible we should also maintain the separation of powers which jefferson considered a cornerstone of democratic government we should not give constitutional

consideration of the first of four budget resolutions made in order by the rule governing house concurrent resolution 115the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is the constructive alternative budget resolution fashioned by the 18 members of thecongressional black caucus of the house of representatives it is the one budget resolution among the four to be considered by the house which responds most succinctly and directly to the mandate given the congress and the president by the american people on november 4 1980 of the four alternatives before us it does the best job of eliminating deficit spending reducing the level of federal spending providing tax relief to the american people and spurring jobs and economic recovery for american businesses and american workers the 18 members of the congressional black caucus are now about to detail for your consideration and debate a resolution that balances the budget in fiscal year 1982 which indeed offers the american people a 7 85 billion surplus instead of the 50 4 deficit that the reaganstockman proposal imposes upon us it is a budget that spends 7 95 billion less than djes the reaganstockman proposal it in a budget resolution that offers the american people 56 4 billion in tax cuts nearly 2 billion more in tax relief than does the reagan stockman proposal and we do it in a fashion that will not concentrate 80 percent of the business and industry tax incentives among the major corporations while providing only 20 percent of the tax relief to the small businesses of the nation which account for 48 percent of private sector gross national products and employ 80 percent of the working people of the country i want you to pay particular attention to the presentations of representative ranoel and representative ford on the tax package that is part of this resolution for it goes to the heart of why we are able to respond best to the mandate of the american people the american people want a new beginning but not a new beginning that is business as usual what good is a socalled tax cut that does not deal with bracket oreep that keeps throwing american workers into higher and higher tax brackets with no real increase in income the reagan proposal continues business as usual inthis regard the congressional black caucus budget resolutionalone among the alternativesgives us a new beginning by correcting bracket creep and returning 17 billion to the american people in tax relief the reaganstockman proposal gives the american taxpayers business as usual when it fails to take into account the increased social security payments that american wage earners and businesses will have to pay this year the cbc budget gives the amer1can taxpayer and small businesses a new beginning a 10percent tax credit on social security payments that returns 10 8 billion zo the american employee and another 7 2 billion to the businesses of our country the 10percent a year acrosstheboard tax cut proposal of the reagan administration is more of the same old thing it will have the average worker earning 15 000 a year paying 93 more in federal taxes by 1984 while the twotenths of 1 percent of the people who earn 200 000 a year will have the government return nearly 20 000 a year to them the american people voted for a new beginning not more of the same old thing with respect to the budget and tax policies of this nation they voted for a balanced budget and reduced federal spending and tax relief not for a legalized raid on the treasury by rich individuals and multinational corporations that will rob the people of 220 billion a year in tax revenues by 1986 they voted for a strong america not an america weekened by throwing 1 1 million people out of work which the reagan human needs budget cuts alone would do in fiscal year 1982 and the fauntroy amendment gives them that they voted for a just and compassionate america not a callous america that would deny a 1 5 billion free lunch to hungry children while continuing a 3 billion free lunch program for the rich that we call the three martini lunch deduction the fauntroy amendiment gives the amerncan people what they voted for it is living proof that the budget can be balanced government spending decreased and tax relief given without necessarily cutting back before yielding to my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to provide you more of the details of our constructive alternative budget resolution let me say three things about this budget resolution that the democraitic study group described as the substitute that takes the boldest step of any proposal being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit that offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any of the proposals before the house and that accomplishes all of this without hurting other important national programs the first is that while the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute is authored by black legislators it is not a program for black people only the most serious problems confronting this nation just happen to be reflected most acutely in the black experience this is a program for all americans the elde ly on limited income most of whom are white the struggling young couples all over the nation who want but cannot find affordable housing anywhere most of whom are white the coal miners whose black lung benefits are being threatened most of whom are white young people from low and middleincome families who would be denied guaranteed student loans and basic opportunity grants for higher education most of whom are white the sick the cold the hungry the handicapped most of whom are white and all of whose burdens will be made heavier by the grammlatta budget proposal thus the solutions we seek are not for black people only but solutions that will benefit all americans black and white together young and old together rich and poor together protestant catholic jew and gentile together the second thing i want to point out is that our constructive alternative budget is based on a different assessment of the root cause of the problem we are experiencing in our domestic economy and the arena of world affairs than that of the reagan administration a in the area of the economy we maintain that inflation unemployment and loweconomic growth are not caused by government spending government taxation and government regulation as the administration would have us believe imprudence in each of these areas contributes to our economic woes and we are as determined as president reagan to sort out waste fraud and abuse at all levels of government expenditures but the fact is that our economic woes have nothing to do with the fact that we provide food stamps for the hungry medicaid for the sick housing for the poor and public service employment for the jobless our economic difficulties are rooted in the fact that other people are making better mousetraps nowadays our difficulties are rooted in the fact that over the past 15 years or more we have had a steady decline in economip performance in manufacturing output in product design and in productivity in sector after sector we are producing insufficient quantities of poorly designed products at too high a price when you do that not only does the world not buy what we make but we do not buy what we make this is best illustrated by an experience which i had a few months ago looking for a christmas gift for my young son marvin he said he wanted a portable radio for christmas i went to one of our local department stores and saw on the shelf a portable radio by rca amfm 87 i was about to purchase it when i noticed on another shelf something called sanyo it said amfm radio three speakers and tape recorder 47 now i love america and i have sense enough to know that when i purchase american made products i am sustaining jobs for americans but when i saw something better for less i must candidly admit that i bought the sanyo and i did it not because i like strange sounding names but because it was a better mousetrap the problem with our economy is that most americans are doing just what i did we are buying datsun toyota kawasaki suzuki honda yamaha panasonic sony seiko nikon and pentax that is our problem and it will not be solved by denying students basic opportunity grants or poor children free lunch or the elderly poor medicaid the problem is that we are losing market shares in the world at large as well as at home the consequence is rising unemployment inadequate profits and therefore reduced investments still worse productivity a falling dollar and still worse inflation our goal therefore must be to restore productivity the competitiveness of unitedstates industry and our other major economic sectors in both domestic and world markets to do this we must undertake the most fundamental reassessment of our economic structure since 1932or perhaps of all time as our colleague representative augustus hawkins has repeatedly pointed out and will do so again today to remedy that problem we must begin to implement the policies called for in the humphreyhawkins full employment and balanced growth act the third thing i should like to say is that the congressional black caucus makes a different assessment of what our problems are in the areas of world affairs our view is that our problems in 1hternational affairs do not lend themselves to military solution they are social economic and political in nature and thus we have emphasized a strong national economy and food and technical assistance as the primary weapons in the arsenal for our confrontation with soviet russia we favor improved national security but without wasteful military spending our budget as representative dellums will point out today calls for defense of our nation not domination of the world our emphasis on the area of foreign affairs must be for example upon development aid and technical assistance to nations like zimbabwe so that mr mugabe may build roads from the chromium mines to the sea where we can buy it sail it to detroit and make a kcair that goes a longer way to empty than does datsun that is what we need to be doing finally our speaker of the house thomas tip oneill has prominently displayed on a desk in his office in the capitol a quote from hubert humphreys last speech on capitol hill on november 17 1977 i think that quote summarizes the choices we must make this week on our budget resolutions he said the moral test of government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the aged and those who are in the shaows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped the three other choices before you this week fail the moral test of government the fauntroy amendment in the nature of a substitute which we now detail for you passes that test with flying colors i yield for the distinguished gentleman from new york to open our presentation of the details of our proposal"], [2.384185791015625e-07, 0.9999997615814209, 1, "i yield myself such time

rapid decline in recent years the causes of this decline are still not fully known and therefore it is necessary to continue this research program this bill authorizes 1 million for each of the next 3

the statute it is in article i of the constitution it is inherent in the right to legislate courts have always so held and that matter is really not in dispute i would also say to the minority leader in response to a point he made earlier charging that the committees request was too broad he knows the subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the committee on energy and commerce has also requested information our request is narrow we have 52 documents we want relating to three sites but the situation is the same in that instance as well the environmental protection agency and the executive branch have said to the congress no you have no right to these documents the reason they give is contained in a letter that was written to chairman dingell and let me quote from this letter of october 25 potential defendants could gain access to sensitive prosecutorial documents through their elected representatives we stress this point because one of the sites in which you have expressed a particular interest is located in the district represented by one of your subcommittee members and a number of the generators of hazardous waste materials contained in another of the sites maintain offices in the district of another subcommittee member i would say to my colleagues in this chamber that that is an insult to the congress of the united states make no mistake about that the executive branch is saying that if they turn over documents to a subcommittee or a committee of the congress that members of that committee are going to run out and give them to defendants in proceedings that are under way i think that is really insulting and balanced against our right under article i to this information it simply cannot be allowed to stand what is our right to legislate and how does it relate here this superfund is a unique law most of the money comes from a fee on the industry involved and some comes from the taxpayers but it embodies the principle that we must first proceed against those responsible for dumping hazardous waste so the money collected from those responsible will be used to replenish the fund if the enforcement program is not effective and efficient then to that extent the fund will not be replenished and we will have to go back to the american people and say we have to raise your taxes because the fund has not been replenished do we

rise in support of h r 5890 and i encourage passage of the amendment that will be offered by mr winn to bring the aeronautics portion of the nasa budget back to the administrations request i must take exception to this committees action however on the proposed revisions of nasas space transportation upper stages program and related changes in the galileo mission to jupiter and the international solar polar mission ispm last year after reviewing the nasa fiscal year 1982 budget request to develop a modified centaur to support planetary exploration programs this committee directed nasa and the dod to conduct a joint study to determine our nations upper stage requirements and to define the most appropriate program for meeting these needs both agencies proceeded to examine current and projected mission requirements and evaluated the following upper stages against those requirements inertial upper state ius centaur transtage interim orbital transfer vehicle iotv the agencies concluded that the iu3 is the only available stage capable ol meeting the near term earthorbiting requirements and with modifications could satisfy nasa and dod earthorbiting missions through the 1980s however the study clearly indicated that t e centaur is the only vehicle capable of meeting near term nasa planetary requirements particularly the need for a galileo combined orbiter probe mission on a direct trajectory to jupiter additionally it was determined that the centaur will satisfy the future envisioned and proposed nasa planetary missions through the mid1990s such findings led nasa and the dod to recommend that the air force continue ius development and production while nasa begin developing the centaur in the intervening four months since this report was released nothing has significantly changed to warrant reprogramming monies from centaur to ius in the nasa budget in fact an ius gallleo mission utilizing the ius on a deltavega trajectory was specifically rejected by the joint study an ius galileo on a deltavega trajectory provides at best major compromise to the mission in addition to mission deficiencies the combination of weight and co location for a galileo combined spacecraft with kick stage would represent a load to tht generic ius which is greater than design limits this fact would require as a minimum structural modifications to stiffen that upper stage while it is apparent that a mission with a combined galileo spacecraft can be accomplished with upper stage performance characteristics equivalent to an ius it is not clear that such a mission could be accomplished withcut major science compromises as well as high cost and schedule risks which would make a single launch in 1985 undesirable because this committees decision to cancel centaur has very serious ramifxcations on our civilian space program not to mention our defense intelligence and telecommunications capabilities i believe it is necessary to reiterate the compelling reasons for proceeding with centaur development for galileo ius cannot meet high energy upper stage requirements for nasa dod and commercial missions failure to move decisively now to develop a high energy upper stage for shuttle will result in an increasing loss of business to foreign competition development of a new high energy upper stage coupled with the decision to reprogram ius for galileo will cost at least 700 800 million more than centaur take at least two years longer to complete and yield no significant performance improvement launching galileo on centaur in 1986 has two critical advantages over a 1985 ius galileo mission cost and benefit first ius cannot meet high energy upper stage requirements for nasa dod and commercial missions ius has a basic design capability of 5 000 pounds to geosynchronous orbit compared to 10 00013 000 pounds for centaur depending on which centaur configuration is utilized consequently as lift requirements increase the need for an adequate upper stage intensifies again the joint nasa dod study accurately summarized this issue the collective trends illustrated as a result of the current analysis of earthorbiting payload requirements show that in the late 80s a need will exist to deliver payloads greater than 5 000 pounds into geosynchronous orbits and that the existing vehicles of the 1980s will determine the spacecraft designs of the late 1980s and the early 1990s the results also indicate that geosynchronous spacecraft develolpment growth rate was slowed considerably during the last decade should a higher performii12196 ance vehicle become available at affordable per flight cost by 1985 spacecraft requirements will grow and effectively utilize the carrier capability in the late 1980s second failure to move decisively now to develop a high energy upper stage for shuttle will result in an increasing loss of business to fureign competition unquestionably launches for foreign payloads mainly communications satellites yield a large favorable balance of payment to the united states it is almost an assurance that the failure to continue centaur development for the shuttle will open this launch market to the europeans and japanese intelsat and comsat have indicated that commercial payload developers desire spacecraft with lift capacities which far exceed existing carrier cap bility according to the joint study intelsat would probably plan earlier conversion to shuttle capability if centaur proceeded through development significantly the direct broadcast satellite corp in a recent letter to this eommittee stated that as a practical matter the ius will not be used for commercial space programs because of its cost and lack of flexfollity the letter goes on to say that what is clearly needed is a flexible highperformance and reasonably priced upper stage of the kind we thought we had in the centaur program finally nasa can convincingly justify a solesource procurement for centaur despite a 1986 galileo launch date and vociferous protests solesource procurements are authorized under 10 unitedstatesc 2304 a 10 and nasa procurement regulation 3210 because of the requirement for maximum practical competition in the conduct of government procurements agency decisions to procure solesource must be adequately justified and are subject to close scrutiny however the general accounting office gao will not substitute its judgment for that of nasa when reviewing the justification for a solesource procurement but will only determine whether the agency decision has a reasonable basis hence the burden is on the protester to make a clear showing that nasas decision is unreasonable as we learned last year timeisoftheessence is a circumstance that along may justify a solesource award the timing for the launch of a space mission is clearly within nasas discretion and the gao has held that mere disagreement with a contracting agencys discretionary decision is not grounds to disturb it to be sure if galileo and ispm are to use a high energy upper stage time is of the essence alternatively i would point out that centaur design production and launch operations teams are now at work on continuing orders extending through 1984 nasa management and support staffs are also functioning tools and equipment for production testing and launch support exist now in mature form centaur for the shuttle has been studied by thrge nasa centers and various contractors safety aspects have undergone particularly close scrutiny again over the last several years consequently solesource procurement of the centaur would take advantage of this wealth of hardware and experience moreover the development of centaur would in fact initiate a more meaningful competition within the shuttles upper stage program by allowing centaur to compete with ius for shuttle launches just as the atlas centaur now competes with the ariane the question is not competition or no competition but development competition or production competition incisively a production competition focusing on price and performance is in the best interests of the american taxpayer and our civiltan space program in summary developing a new high performance stage would unquestionably take longer than modifying an existing stage t run a full competition as contemplated by this committee would also delay the availability of a high performance stage a new stage also would not approach the maturity and reliability of a modified centaur and undoubtedly costs would be much higher than for a modified centaur i strongly urge my colleagues to pursue centaur development in the nasa fiscal year 1982 and 1983 budgets for a 1986 galileo launch as has been approved previously by the senate authorizing committee for nasa

report on h r those of us who engage in conferences with the senate are all too aware of the problems caused by nongermane amendments that seem to easily find their way into house bills that are carefully considered by appropriate house committees that are sensitive to the germaneness rule and to the jurisdiction of other house committees a good many of these nongermane amendments are floor amendments that have not been exposed to the hearing process or to debate some of these amendments that the house conferees are urged to bring back to the house in spite of the longstanding rule on germaneness are pet projects of staff peisons or parochial interests that could never be passed if they were in the form of a freestanding bill such is the case with the conference report on h r 2330 this bill began as a nuclear regulatory commission authorization act for fiscal years 1982 and 1983 the bill now after the adoption of many nongermane senate amendments is simply an omnibus atomic energy act amendments bill this small 2year authorization bill now contains no fewer than 11 substantive and sweeping amendments to current law if these amendments were so badly needed one wonders why

an opportunity to debate the merits of these changes to permanent law every legislative reorganization act that i remember has tried to deal with this type of abuse of the legislative process we now

staff people or to members having parochial interests let us preserve the integrity as well as the honesty of the legislative process let us vote down these nongermane amendments i strongly oppose section 14 the fact that section 14 makes no sense is easily illustrated if we consider a few questions are we to ban milltary use of food because it is derived from the same farms that produce food for civilian use are we to prohibit military consumption of petroleum if that petroluem is taken from the same fields that produce it for civilian uses are we to preclude our soldiers sailors and airmen from consuming cocacola and pepsicola because the plants which produce our servicemens beverages are basically civilian in nature should electricity from nuclear powerplants not be used for atomic energy defense activities are we to forbid chemical plants which produce goods from civilians from ever supplying the military obviously we are not and will not but if we are not doing these ridiculous things then why are we considering a similar action with respect to plutonium derived from civilian spent nuclear fuel the answer i am told is that we must adopt a law barring military use of spent nuclear fuel because antinuclear groups otherwise will erroneously claim as they erroneously will anyway that civilian nuclear powerplants are bomb factories well i am deeply troubled and i believe that we all should be that it has somehow suddenly become ghastly and immoral to contribute to the nations defense even as a bomb factory in years past our bomb factories helped us protect our freedom and helped us to end wars started by totalitarian aggressors by supplying us with the means to defense ourselves even as we speak these now lowly bomb factories continue to protect our liberties keeping this generations crop of totalitarian aggressors at bay in sum this amendment is based on the presumption that our national defense is somehow immoral this is grounds enough to oppose it but there are other reasons as well for one thing it is illogical and wasteful of taxpayers money to hinge decisions relating to the national defense on misperceptions and propaganda propounded by antinuclear groups if it is economically desirable to resort to military use of spent nuclear fuel why not allow the military to make that use why should taxpayers be burdened with the additional billions to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons if the president and the congress agree that nuclear weapons must be produced and the plutonum could be made available from spent fuel i
