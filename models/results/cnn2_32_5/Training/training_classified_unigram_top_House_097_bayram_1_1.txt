civil liberties and the administration of justicewhich has oversight responsibility over the federal prison system the unitedstates parole commission the office of legal policy the unitedstates marshals and the office of unitedstates attorneysi am convinced that each of these entities will be able to satisfy its statutory and policy mandates there are two particular issues that i would like to clarify for the record in reference to the discussion in the report relating to alternative uses for the alderson w va institution i would like to add a few comments the committee has reviewed the study of the bureau of prisons alderson task force and supports one of three components of option 1 that is the use of danbury conn satellite camp as a minimum security camp for women presently there are no camps which house women although several house men danbury is also accessible to public transportation and to work and training opportunities however the other two components of the option 1 raise serious problems and deserve more careful analysis before any efforts are made to implement them one would be to convert alderson to a cocorrectional facility the committee questions the wisdom of maintaining an institution as remote as alderson whether as a cocorrectional or single sex institution i population pressures and trends as well as classification levels should be carefully reviewed before this option is undertaken considering the present decline in inmate population continued use of alderson may not be necessary the third componentdeveloping a150bedsecure facility for women adjacent to fci lexington ky raises the most serious questions there is no documentation supporting the need for such a facility and the bureau of prisons should carefully review the population trends and the relevant classification characteristics prior to pursuing this component it is expected that the bureau of prisons will keep this committee informed as it moves to implement any aspect of option 1 with regard to section 11 of h r 3462which mandates that the attorney general develop a procedure to insure that no person under the age of eighteen shall be held as a material witness in a bureau of prisons or a state or local correctional facility the primary purpose of which is to provide for the custody of adult offendersi am pleased to announce that the department of justice already has moved forward to enunciate a policy in a iecent letter to me deputy attorney general edward c schmults stated recently you expressed concern about the conditions of confinement of alien material witnesses who are detained in the san diego california area you were apparently troubled by reports of overcrowding at the metropolitan correctional center in san diego and of incarceration of female and juvenile material witnesses at that institution as you may be aware the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit has ruled that the sixth amendment rights of a person charged with alien smuggling are violated if the government deports any of the material witnesses before the defense counsel has had a reasonable opportunity to interview them united states v mendezrodriguez 450 f 2d 9th cir 1971 further experience has taught that many alien witnesses will flee if not incarcerated pending deportation thus the government is faced with a dilemma in the handling of these witnesses i have exitmined information compiled by my staff that addresses your concerns i am convinced that the department has responsibly endeavored to satisfy human rights and legal requirements in the detention of aliens the unitedstates attorneys office in san diego has obtained court approval of a procedure under which detention of eathalien material witness is limited to 10 daysunless the prosecution or defense specifies within that period that the witness is needed to testify at trial as a result most alien witnesses are released to the immigration and naturalization service for deportation within 10 days of the time they were initially apprehended with rare exceptions female and juvenile material witnesses are not incarcerated after apprehension such witnesses are transported to the metropolitan correctional center for processing ordinarily within a matter of hours thereafter they are immediately placed into one of two social service programs contracted for by the unitedstates marshals service women and young children generally age 12 and under are placed at the salvation armys door of hope facility in san diego it is a modern structure with private rooms a dining hall and recreational equipment witnesses lodged at the door of hope are not under any physical restraint but are asked to provide their personal assurance that they will not flee the salvation army facility was selected for this program by virtue of the fact that it is the only one in the san diego area of sufficient slie to accommodate all of the female and younger juvenile witnesses the arrangement between the marshals service and the salvation army precludes the proselytizing of witnesses the program was begun on july 9 1979 from that date through february 1981 a total of 453 women and 255 childrenhave been housed at the door of hope the average length of stay of these material witnesses has been approximately 12 days older juvenile witnesses are placed in foster homes pursuant to a program developed with catholic family services san diego this program was begun on november 30 1979 from that time through february 1981 a total of 517 juveniles have received shelter in foster homes the average stay of these juveniles has been approximately three and onehalf days this is influenced by the fact that a substantial portion of these juveniles were at the time of their apprehension unaccompanied by an adult relative and that many defense counsel are willing to stipulate promptly to the release of unaccompanied juveniles the only ferpale or juvenile material witnesses who are incarcerated are those who state that they will flee if no confined since november 30 1979 less than 15 persons have been confined on this basis two were women and the remainder were older juveniles due to the risk of flight virtually all aden material witnesses who are adult males are incarcerated during fiscal year 1979 approximately 3 800 such witnesses were incarcerated in the san diego area while in fiscal year 1980 the figure was approximate ly 2 000 the average length of incarceration per witness was approximately 16 days most of these alien material witnesses are housed in the metropolitan correctional center in san diego a modern facility operated by the unitedstates bureau of prisons they are segregated from the general population of the institution while the alien material witness problem has taxed the facilities of the metropolitan correctional centerr unreasonable overcrowding is avoided through the transfer of excess witnesses to the ins detention center in el centro california additionally the marshals service is pres ently negotiating to obtain space in a county detention facility finally a pilot project has been started with the salvation army whereby a limited number of adult males adjudged to be particularly good risks not to flee are being placed in the door of hope facility as of the end of february 1981 10 male witnesses have participated in this program the departments efforts to ensure the humane treatment of alien material wit nesses parallel successful efforts to obtain judicial rulings narrowing the application of the mendezrodriguez decision thereby reducing the number of material witnesses who must be detained the government can now proceed immediately with deportation of aliens where the defendant has executed a waiver of his right to call the aliens as witaesses united states v lujancastro 602 f 2d 877 9th cir 1979 or where the aliens could not reasonably be deemed to be mate rial to the case united states v gonzales 617 f 2d 1358 9th cir 1980 i believe that the department has exhibited sensitivity to the liberties of alien witnesses and their families in discharging its legal obligations to the accused and in the enforcement of the immigration laws please advise me if you desire further assistance in this matter i might add that i do not consider the world held in the bill to encompass the expeditious processing of material witnesses in a correctional facility nor does it include brief housing overnight or over a weekend while suitable alternatives are sought in addition the amendment does not preclude the use of juvenile facilities to detain juveniles who threaten to flee if not confined in conclusion i urge an aye vote on h r 3492 there is only one other question that was raised last year and this year and i would like to address it if i may to the chairman of the committee that question goes to the matter of marshals service of process the question i would liketo address to my chairman is this is funding provided in h r 3462 for the serving of private process by unitedstates marshals"], [0.44289642572402954, 0.5571035742759705, 1, "last month there was widespread news coverage of 70 world war ii stalag 17 former prisoners of war during their reunion they pleaded for better compensation for medical problems relating to their imprisonment these expows have lived with these terrible war experiences for well over 35 years it is therefore that we are considering a bill to enhance their lives during the later years of their lives americans as prisoners of war have faced many hardships though the nature of capture and internment can vary within any period of war from camp to camp and even for the individual prisoner of war from guard to guard the prisoner of war experience is characterized by executions torture and a crushing sense of doom and loss of hope through a starvation diet poor quality or nonexjune 1 1 981 istent medical care and death marches former prisoners of war suffer a higher incidence of physical and psychological disorders related to the conditions of their imprisonment by enemy forces statistics based on comparisons of veterans and former prisoners of war on va compensation rolls show that less than 10 percent of war veterans receive compensation compared with 43 6 percent for former prisoners of war existing data also shows that a significantly higher proportion of living prisoners of war are more severely disabled50 percent or greater than other living veterans the war claims commission in 1950 found widespread evidence of the after effects of imprisonment from their sampling of world war ii pows and studies released by the va in 1956 and 1980 also acknowledge this in fact psychological and physical digabilities as related to imprisonment are recognized by nations around the world including our former enemies although the congress has on several occasions enacted laws liberalizing eligibility requirements for va benefits for this most deserving class of veteransespecially by the creation of presumptions of service connection with respect to certain nutritional disordersthere remains concern as to the problems encountered by former prisoners of war in their efforts to prove service connection for disabilities attributable to the conditions of their capture and imprisonment some claim that their ability to prove service connection for disabilities is hampered because of inadequate medical records and that certain disabilities which were originally considered to be minor at the time of release from service are now becoming more serious h r 1100 is based in part on the findings conclusion and recommendations for legislative action made by the va in its report entitled study of former prisoners of war which was submitted to the congress on may 30 1980 pursuant to section 305 of the veterans disability compensation and survivors benefits act of 1978 public law 95479 as specified in the law the areas of the study included descriptions and analyses of the repatriation procedures including physical examinations for former prisoners of war and the adequacy of such procedures and the resultant medical records of former prisoners of war the types and severity of disabilities that are particularly prevalent among former prisoners of war in various theaters of operation at various times a description and analysis of procedures used with respect to former prisoners of war in determining eligibility for health care benefits and in adjudicating claims for disability compensation including an analysis of the current use of statutory and regulatory provisions specifically relating to former prisoners of war and a survey and analysis of the medical literature on the health related problems of former prisoners of war there follows a summary of the findings and legislative recommendations contained in the study summary the major finding derived from the description and analysis of repatriation procedures was that the comprehensive administrative and medical repatriation procedures written for world war ii and korea pows were not fully implemented in the medical area evidence of this comes from a physclan review of a representative sample of former world war ii pow claims folders which revealed that many of these records lacked repatriation examinations thus the congressional concern about the lack of repatriation examinations and resultant medical records among these former pows is well founded the claims folder review also demonstrated that while the medical proc essing of korea pows as indicated by their repatriation examinations was better than that of former world war ii pows it was still not completely adequate the inadequate medical processing which apparently characterized the repatriation of former world war ii and korea pows is not an issue among former vietnam pows as they received the most thorough repatriation medical examinations and followup care of any pow group the principal finding from the review of the types and severity of former pow disabilities is that former pows have a significantly higher incidence of serviceconnected disability the data comparison demonstrated that former pacific theater powa are the most disabled of the pow groups under study followed closely by former korea pows while not as disabled as pacific and korea expows former european theater pows are still significantly more disabled than other world war ii veterans while conclusions about therelative disability of former vietnam pows must await the outcome of currently ongoing studies it to apparent from the available morbidity and mortality data on world war ii and korea pows that those pows interned by an asian captor generally received harsher treatment and suffered from more disabilities than other pows the review of the types and severity of former pow disabilities also points out that the most prevalent serviceconnected condition of the former pows under study from the time of their repatriation to the present is anxiety neurosis a comparison of serviceconnected anxiety neurosis among former european theater pows with length of internment revealed that anxiety neurosis appears in a significantly greater amount among these former pows than among other serviceconnected wartime veterans this relationship persists regardless of the length of time in captivity the central finding of the analysis of law and procedures concerning former pows is that in determining eligibility for health care benefits or in adjudicating disability compensation claims the va generally accords famver pows the special consideratlon o which they are entitled under current statutory and regulatory provisions the survey of the medical literature used a wide variety of sources such as national and international medical journals followup epidemiological studies personal accounts and discussions of family and social issues to point out that the pow experience affects their current health status the published medical literature indicates that many of the present physical problems of former pows may be attributed to the malnutrition and brutality suffered during captivity just as many of their present psychological problems can be attributed to the stress of internment the medical literature review points out that psychological problems in the form of anxiety neurosis aid psychosis are particularly prevalent among former powl the conclusions presented below are based on the above mentioned principal findings each conclusion provides the supporting rationale for a corresponding recommendation the recommendations include both legislative and administrative actions considered necessary to assure that former pows receive compensation and health care benefits for all disabilities which may reasonably be attributed to their internment"], [0.44374096393585205, 0.556259036064148, 1, "it is certainly not my intention to consume 1 hour but my request is consistent with the previous requests hereinbefore made the purpose on this occasion is to comply with an indication and a promise i had made with respect to the resolutions and the bills i have introduced concerning the federal reserve board highinterestrate question and related financial fiscal monetary matters that agitate the country and flagellate it so severely i said before that when i introduced last year the resolution calling for the impeachment of the chairman of the federal reserve board paul volcker and then subsequently the followup resolution that included the members of the open market committee socalled which means the federal reserve board plus five private bankers i was ridiculed to a certain extent not too much but some and i have gone through this before all through my career such as it is in elective public office i was ridiculed when i initiated my career on the city council of the city of gan antonio when singlehandedly i advocated called for fought for and i mean i use the word fight advisedly i never talk a fight if i am going to get in a fight i fight a fight i try to avoid one but if i get in one i am going to fight it i am not going to pull punches and i am not going to talk it i am going to fight it at that time it had to do with the socalled city water board water utility it was structured very much the same as the present light and gas utility is in my area i had started the fight on that one when i left the city council to seek the position of state senator and won that so that the fight still remains unsolved and is in fact the main reason why the city of san antonio continues to be so victimized in fact robbed in the most vital section of all which is the indispensable energy light and gas to the people today but at that time the city water board was structured the same way it was a closed selfperpetuating cooperation anchored down in what they considered then as iron and an indenture that had been entered into in 1925 and here in 1953 with an indenture that had a life of 40 years people ridiculed me laughed at me at first in fact were absolutely insulting and then later when it aroused the publics attention and the knowledgeable citizens support then there was anger toward me and i had everything from threats to actual attempts to try to frame me up all of which in effect and strangely enough i think contributed to the main reason why i am here today as an elected congressman from that district i do not think that if those fights had not been fought and won incidentally eventually that i would be here today because i certainly have never had any kind of organized backing of money or base of any perpetual type and have had to confront all of those forces but wlhat i am saying is that on the local level it was no different except just the scale than wnat i have confronted here on some of the fights that i have found myself engaged in during the last 20 years that i have had the great privilege of serving in this capacity so when i introduced these resolutions i had some comment and some commentators in fact just not too long ago the very prominent magazine newsweek had an extensive article on paul volcker specifically and the federal reserve generally and the gentleman who wrote the article made allusion to me and said that i even had a grandstand resolution of impeachment of paul volcker but interestingly enough the very next line he said however it must be admitted there is no other way that a chairman can be removed well i thought in a way that was a sort of lefthanded respectful admission that maybe i did have a serious purpose and that there was a serious and logical reason upon which i based my motivation for introducing the iesolution but more importantly i consider the two bills that i introduced contemporaneously that have to do with what i consider to be the long overdue congressional oversight and responsibility for seeing in 1913 when the congress passed the federal reserve act of 1913 but things have become so contrived and so distorted that even members of the congress have talked to me in terms of such a nature that the federal reserve is considered to be a separate independent whohy autonomous institution that they infer sprung from the brow of job where as a matter of fact it is a creature it is a creature of congress it is a creature of the people the congress being the representatives of the people the federal reserve board is indeed not an autonomous selfgoverning selfdetermining body but it has behaved that way to where it now believes it and in the 20 years that i have been on the banking committee in the congress 20 years and 3 months to be exactly i have seen no member of the federal reserve board i have seen no chairman of the federal reserve board ever come to the congress and answer a question having to do with the most responsive and responsible activity of any organization and that is accountability accountability as to how how they arrive at their judgmental decisions that determine whether or not the american people will continue to be robbed by extortionate rates of interest never the only agents we have such as the gao as long ago as 18 years ago told me that they had no jurisdiction to do that they could not go in they call it an audit i was not asking for an audit i was merely asking to find out what were the procedures in these judgmental decisions in fact even as to administration of the entity itself and who if anybody in the federal reserve boards structure itself would be responsible for oversight did they do they now have such an office as an office of inspector general i do not know i cannot find out from anybody obviously not from the lack of accountability but it has reached such a point that i is ridiculous last month the president had a secret meeting with the chairman of the federal reserve board can you imagine the chief executive of our country having to have a secret meeting to reckon with and discuss the question of high interest rates and related matters that have to do with monetary and fiscalpolicy in secret and the chairman of the board being obsequious to accept and go over and sit down and meet in secret they never did come out you know it is jut as if it were two heads of foreign states having a summit meeting except that they never have issued a communique you do not know what they agreed on so the speculation in the wall street journal the speculation in the washington post by the official writers and the experts and the either selfappointed or paidforbeing experts all have said and i am sure it is conjecture because even they did not say they have sources and the only sources would be paul volcker or president ronald reagan but they say that there obviously was no understanding as to whether or not mr volcker would yield even a little bit in what is in the jargon of that world tight money policy the real issue and i think the one that is attributable directly to the fact that a nation such as ours would have reached that hardtobelieve point where it would not only tolerate but accept without whimper a 21percentplus interest rate as a prime rate mind you a prime rate and never in the history of any country never in the written history of mankind even going back to the time preceding jesus christ even the jewish elders even they had laws in fact at one time one of those ancient kings mandated illegal on penalty of death any payment of interest then subsequent to that and by the time jesus christ appeared on mankinds horizon it was illegal at a certain rate then and all through mankinds history why because and i have not seen any economists i have not seen anybody on our level come and define it this way because interest rate or rates is a mechanism by virtue of which the wealth of a society is transferred it is that simple but now i rise because i promised that if i could i would try to get seri ous consideration of the first impeachment resolution why the impeachment resolution is that a showmansbip a gimmick to get publicity well if i thought so i would be pretty dumb i have a lot of other ways that i think i have garnered in 28 years of public elective office that are easier shorter and quicker to get publicity but i do so because it is necessary to have somehow an awakening of a responsibility first on the part of the congress my colleagues as to the absolute need to go back as we should have done several decades ago to complete or try to complete the continuing process really of the federal reserve act because things have happened that have canceled out the main reason why the federal reserve act was adopted but when we study history and in fact to the very beginning of our government as we understand it that is under this constitution this has been the central problem it is to me unbelievable that in 1981 and 1982 we would have reached the point that is absolutely the same as the first congress confronted when it had to originate and found what they called the bank of north america then the first bank of the united states a 20year charter they had the same issues what is the issue let us face it squarely and without any kind of folderol or fancy words the issue is power who is going to exercise the power of control oi money over the people and that means interest rates and hamilton himselfyou know when you use labels i dislike labels because they are never accuratebut even by any loose terminology in the abuse of words today i think hamilton would have been considered the conservative of the day even he and what he is recorded in history as having said even jefferson who was for more vehement if i were to say about bankers today what jefferson said i would be assailed immediately as a bitter antibanker congressman but the reason they said it was for that central reason but they had the honesty the courage the intregity to control and not let the control get out of the peoples hands so the first two banks were successful even though by the time andrew jackson came along and you had the failure to renew the charter or the bank other conditions had crept in naturally because by then our country was bustling it was bursting at the seams it was expanding but what was the central issue the same as in the beginning where were the credit allocations going to come from in order to fire the engines of industry and new manufacture so then we jumped we hit the civil war and everybody even in the congress has forgotten the 1865 national currency act that is the one that gave birth to the socalled national banking system again what was the central issue the same one who is going to control the country now is trying to lick its wounds forge ahead the industrial revolution was really bound up exponentially and the country was again bursting at the seams so you had the depression the depression of the 1870s and then a refurbishing and a reenactment of the national act in 1b95 or thereabouts but even then control was still lost sight of and so in 1907 the country again had reached the point where it was continuing to expand tremendously it was going into areas beyond continental north america and therefore the needs for credit and the like were even greater they were exponential again and what happened that socalled banking system was doing the same thing that the federal reserve is trying to do now and so what happened you had the calamitous depression of 1907 and finally in 1912 the congress trying to answer it could not do it bilaterally you could not get a joint congressional action so finally the house of representatives enacted a resolution and created the pujo committee that was the father of the 1913 federal reserve act and what was it they came up with the restructuring to meet the conditions of 1912 and 1913 of the original central question that confronted george washington alexander hamilton thomas jefferson james madison and our great great founding fathers and later andrew jackson and later abraham lincoln and later those presidents who followed abraham lincoln and then woodrow wilson in 1912 and and when you read the memoirs of carter glass when you read the memoirs of those who were trying to forge the congressional action that became labeled the federal reserve act of 1913 and you read about the stony silence and the incipient resistance that woodrow wilson met when he met privately with the bankers in the white house and carter glass and them the struggle was the same the issue was the same but for the moment at least the power was still defined essentially in control of the people but by 1923 and the creation of such a thing as the open market committee remember what gives rise to that entity but what it did was to open the door to the fox to get into the chicken coop at will and from then on it has been just a matter of what discretionary judgment the fox march 25 1 982 is going to use as to how many chickens he thinks he has to consume at any given moment that is exactly what it amounts to today because then that has been compounded since 1952 with this gimmickry that postures the united states uniquely we are the only country in the world in the industrialized world or any other where we allow our money to be handled this way where our tax money handlers for our government pays interest on its money no other country does that in the whole world yet that has gone unchallenged not even debated so the usurpation as i charge of the rightful powers of the federal reserve as exercised through the chairman and the members of the board on the open market committee is certainly within the definition of impeachable offenses and so i promised the last time that if i failed to receive any serious consideration by the house judiciary committeeand i read into the record the last time the letter i had received from chairman rodino in which he says that he instructed the staff to look over the requesti have not heard the results of that instruction i do not know but he said that he did not think that there could be much action because the committee was overloaded it had a very pressing schedule so i said well within a reasonable amount of time if it looks obvious that it will not receive serious consideration by the responsible committee then i will proceed to have a de facto judiciary committee proceeding of impeach ment on the house floor and i here and now announce that the next time that i am privileged to address the house i will initiate such a proceeding in the meanwhile i think that it is obvious now we have the very same administration and its spokesmen the money managers the money regulators of all of these institutions are now coming in for instance as of yesterday and the day before yesterday the chief regulators the chairman of the federal deposit insurance corporation the chairman of the home loan bank board who finally admitted yesterday to what we could not get him to admit a year ago and mind you i say this not because i want to say i told you so or he is to blame or she is to blame but because if we can trigger actioni am not interested in this gamesmanship of blamesmanship this is what the president has been doing since he was sworn in this is what everybody in and out of congress has been doingblaming somebody blaming carter or blaming this or blaming thatwhen what we need is to get together to devise an affirmative program to correct the ills because as finally admitted yesterday even if interest rates were to fall now it is too late the chairman of the home loan bank board said many of these institutions are gone they are dead some of those even now that have been temporarily salvaged through the socalled gimmickry of mergering they are still not out of the woods but if this is not reversed a substantial number will be out before the end of the year now what kind of business is this in america in the united states how far have we gone down the trail of the primrose path of compla ency of trying to whistle as we passed a graveyard and cannot somebody on the part of our responsible appointed leaders or elected leaders either executive or congressional have the fortitude and the courage to say ok even if it means that i will be charged with eating crow even if it means that i will be charged with having to backpedal on what i said was my program and indispensable to america for its salvation even if it means that i will lose my seat this next november or at any future time this is what we must get together on basically this is what we must do to solve the problem not to find the excuses to try to seek action of an emergency nature that at best is temporary and may save or may not save a few maybe maybe not maybe not for long because a way can be found that will save face i think we have already paid an enormous price in blood and money for that kind of policy in the other areas in international areas what i am saying today is that the essential problem confronting our government our people our leaders is basically the same one that has confronted our country since the beginning of this form of government insofar as fiscal and monetary matters are concerned but that now because of the nature of the changed world we have a factor over which we have up to now even minimal control and that is the international that we must take into account some of which may be amenable to american government control but this is the area that now has escaped the vigilance and the accountability that we ought to demand for the american people after all this is what it is all about the issue is not whether reaganomics is rigidly right or rigidly wrong the issue is not whether henry gonzalez is going to be reelected or should be reelected the issue is how are we serving the american people and even if the american people can be fooled as they have can be lulled as they have mostly because they are not informed mostly because as on the international level the issues are not honestly presented to them because leaders are fearful that the american people might be frightened or that their anger will be such that they will be thrown out of office i have been privileged to travel especially in the last year in behalf of the subcommittee that i chair on housing and urban development from the eastern shore to california and what i see there does not confirm the fear and the lack of confidence that i see reflected in our political leaders i see courage i see greatness among the plain average american who says just give us the truth what are you afraid of tell us what is the truth we do not know we entrusted it to you we assume that you at least ought to know what are the issues and this is where i think we have been victimized on the international level as long as we have not found a way to control or at least thwart the enormous power of such entities as opec for example and or our overwhelming dependencon the particular power that that entity controls is a continuing challenge and it has tremendous impact on monetary and fiscal matters as it does in every other level because of the intractable link between our energy consumption or our need for energy and the basic progress and augmentation not an economy of scarcity not an economy of blight but the proverbial economy of plenty and prosperity and a fair share for every american not block him out of his share of the american way of life this is what is at stake this is what has been at stake i take pride in having identified it that way first locally back home and then up here for not 10 years not 15 years not whch the republican administration was in power but when a personal friend was in powerand i was just as critical in some areas then as i am now for the stated reasons on recordbut as i said in the beginning just as in the case of the local fights if i am not rebutted if my questions are not successfully answered i will not stop persisting and this is all i believe that one man can do but i believe we have reached the point now where for many americans individuals and collective businesses there is no point of return this is lamentable because it was inevitable high interest rates are not god ordained high interest rates are not an act of god and yet the chairman of the fed presidents of the united states colleagues of mine in congress great industrial leaders and manufacturing firm heads all have talked to me all have spoken all have written as if it is an act of god as if you cannot do anything what is the matter with you now they are saying well you see you have this debt and you have this deficit but we have had worse relationships before and we are not flagellated with 21 percent rates not even 10 percent so as i initiate what i consider to be the ad hoc substitute de facto hnpeachment proceedings on the house floor i will further elaborate and document these statements that i have made today because i think no matter what happens inescapably the american government and its leaders will have to confront this issue they will have to confront the restructuring of the federal reserve act they will have to consider and bring about and the sooner the better whether it is long range or short range the federal reserve board will have to yield to accountability as long as it is not it cannot have it both ways the president himself has admitted that yes the federal reserve board has something to do with the reason for high interest rates the federal reserve board says oh no that is not our target we are not handling monetary or fiscal policy in such a way as to impact on interest rates interest rates are due to the lack of confidence or because of deficit or the national debt or something or inflation they were saying inflation yet i offer for the record at this point a lead article in the washington post which isthey call it the weekly business advocate newspaperthe chamber of commerce publication and the title is interest rate level puzzles experts too well the reason it puzzles is they have been making all kinds of outrageous statements and attempting to perpetuate these myths as to who the culprit is in other words blame joe what i call the present game of blamesmanship and everybody is indulging in it even now instead of saying wait a while to this extent it is my baby and here is what i think i can do about it and here is what i suggest now let us get together this is what i think i will humbly attempt to do in an individual and perhaps a very small way because it is too late to worry about who is to blame for this that and the other we have a whole history going back to 1789 if we want to find causes and figures to blame and all that but at this point we have got to seek the path out of the jungle on our own we cannot expect americans who live no longer than 1920 even those that were living in 1950 because we got another world it is another country it is

certain purposes to amend title 10 of the united states code by adding four sections in a new chapter to get the bill out before the membersit is brief not lengthysection 371 permits the secretary of defense to provide federal state and local law enforcement officials any information collected during the course of military operations that may be relevant to a violation of any federal or state law this section does not provide any new authority with respect to gathering information for military purposes it merely provides for the dissemination of such information to civilian law enforcement officials if for example during an awacs training flight aircraft were identified approaching unitedstates international borders the air force could notify unitedstates customs officials to permit them to attempt to identify the nature and the business of this aircraft or if a navy destroyer operating off the florida coast ohserves some suspicious looking ships approaching the coast it could pass this information on to the unitedstates coast guard section 372 the next section permits the secretary of defense to make available to federal state and local officials equipment base facilities research facilities of the armed forces if that action will not adversely affect the military preparedness of the united states this section would provide clear authority for practices which have traditionally been approved by the departments of defense and justice in recent years the military departments have provided assistance to civilian law enforcement officials for example the army has on loan to the unitedstates customs service over 5 million worth of equipment and it loaned armored personnel carriers helmets and flak jackets to the department of justice personnel who participated in the wounded knee incident several years ago section 373 permits the secretary to assign members of the armed forces to train federal state and local law enforcement officials in the operation of military equipment made available by section 372 and to provide expert advice to them again this section clarifies authority for traditional cooperation with civilian law enforcement officials for example the army military police school at fort mcclellan has trained civilians in photographic operations and trained civilian officers in the use of equipment or facilities to them for law enforcement purposes section 374 requires the secretary of defense to issue regulations first to insurethat the provision of assistance equipment or facilities does not impair military training or operations necessary to the military preparedness of the united states and second to insure reimbursement for the provision of assistance obtained from the department of defense when the secretary determines it is appropriate the regulations provided by this section will insure that the cooperation with the civilian law enforcement of f dials does not interfere with carrying out the primary mission of our armed forces that is military preparedness the regulation will also insure that the law enforcement cooperation is not done at the expense of defense activities the results of the armed forces work should not be used at the cost of defense budgets to support the activities of other agencies of government regardless of how laudable those activ ities might be i understand the department of defense has always required reimbursement in the past and it will continue to do so under these provisions section 375 which is the most controversial part of this measure permits the secretary of defense upon request from a federal drug agencyhere we are getting down to a more narrow activity now just a federal drug agencyto assign armed forces members to assist federal drug enforcement officals in drug seizures jand arrests provided first such assistance will not adversely affect military preparedness of the united states second that the secretary determines that the drug enforcement operation may not succeed without the existence of military personnel third drug officials maintain ultimate control of the operation and fourth such assignment shall not occur in any location or circumstance not previously approved by the secretary of state this section would allow drug participation by armed services personnel in drug enforcement operations i should also point out that this direct participation by military personnel is authorized only in drug law enforcement matters whereas the provision of indirect military support relates to law enforcement generally this distinction is made because of the critical need for additional resources in enforcement of drug laws i am pointing out that the early sections of this section 908 are broader then these very narrow ones with regard to drugs heretofore such direct participation has not been possible because of the posse comitatus act section 1385 title 18 united states code that section prohibits the use of any part of the army or the air force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the law posse comitatus is defined by webster as the power of a county the power of a sheriff to summon the whole body of inhabitants to assist in preserving the public peace or in executing a legal order this prohibition originated in the army appropriations act of 1878 it was enacted in response to the use of federal troops to police state elections in former confederate states whtere the civil power had been reestablished and where the union veterans were enforcing the local law the primary concern of the act was the prospect of unitedstates marshals on their own initiative calling up troops to form a posse or to otherwise perform direct law enforcement functions to execute the law although it appears applicable only to the army the law was amended to include the air force when that department was spun off in 1947 although the act by its terms does not include the navy or marine corps the navy has adopted that restriction by selfimposed administrative action clearly the circumstances of 1878 do not prevail today our nation is faced with a crisis of law enforcement international drug dealers because of the tremendous profits of their illicit business can afford the finest and the most sophisticated electronic devices which are capable of penetrating our borders and evading law enforcement officials with immunity limited budgets prevent local state or federal law enforcement agencies from buying the radar or electronic equipment to locate the smugglers but much of the necessary equipment and expertise in the operation are found in the armed forces in order to respond to the challenges of the drug dealers this nation must marshal all of its available resources it can take a large step in that direction by permitting the use of military equipment and personnel in cooperation with civilian law enforcement officials some people say why dont you leave this as it is in the hands of the coast guard it would cost approximately 4 billion to build the coast guard ships needed to do the job if the coast guard were to get these ships after this drug war was over or greatly made unnecessary all these billions of dollars worth of ships would no longer be necessary we would also have to employ many thousands perhaps as many as 20 000 new coast guard personnel section 908 permits the use of the resources of the military departments in the war against drug dealers this section would permit the use of military equipment and personnel without violating the federal governments traditional separation of civilian and military functions participation of military personnel could occur only in drug enforcement and then only with the specific authority of the secretary of defense his approval would depend upon a finding that there would be no adverse effect on milit py readiness second that the drug enforcement operation would not succeed without the participation of military personnel third that the federal drug enforcement officers would maintain ultimate control over the operation not the mllitary fourth that previous approval of the location and circumstances must be given by the secretary of state those last limitations were placed on because of the concern of some people about the rio grande and that possibly there should be some provision that the secretary of state should pass on that before anything like that would be done those limitations will insure that there would be no indiscriminate use of armed forces personnel they will be called upon when it is apparent that the seizure and arrest would fail but for their participation in all situations they will be under the control of civilian federal drug enforcement officials thus preserving the historic separation between civilian and military spheres of activity of our government over the years congress has not hesitated to permit direct participation by the military in matters much less important on several occasions the military has been authorized to assist civilian law enforcement officials in areas such as detention of vessels for customs and in the enforcement of the 200mile limit the epidemic of illegal drugs is a matter of much graver national concern it threatens the morel and physical well being of our entire nation since the posse comitatus law makes any improper military support of civilian law enforcement a federal felo ly military commanders who must often make a speedy decision with regard to whether they can comply with the request have understandably been cautious in construing such requests but any delay can jeopardize important law enforcement operations it is important therefore that the law be as clear as possible in identifying those circumstances in which the military can cooperate lawfully with the civilian law enforcement officers accordingly it is essential that we take this action to amend the law the question then is very simply are we willing to make a commitment to stop drug smuggling or will we wait until those drugs shatter the minds and lives of a genei ation of our young people i believe we must act to protect our youth we must conmnit all of our resources including the military now i made a list of the various places where the posse comitatus law is not applicable by a particular special act of congress such include arresting trespassers in national parks who can be apprehended and arrested by military personnel also to protect against crimes against members of congress including any assault on a member of congress congressmen can call in the military to make such arrests there are many other things of this type protecting indians indian landa civil rights laws customs officials as a matter of fact congress even passed a law some years ago that if you establish a right to bird droppings on an island the military can be called in to make an arrest to protect your property in the bird droppings so certainly if we have these trivial things addressed things of not nearly the significance of drug smuggling we certainly should give assistance in the field of drug enforcement i want to say to the members i am somewhat of an amateur historian and this posse comitatus thing really sprang out of the fact that the people in the south did not want the union veterans to be disturbing them in the way they would like to be undisturbed and they got the power in congress to pass this law and they did what did the real fathers of our country think about such a law the real fathers of our country such as george washington had no apprehension about leading troops in the western part of pennsylvania where the people were making moonshine and did not want to pay taxes george washington himself went out there with military forces in 1794 to see to it that the law was enforced and the taxes paid so we are dealing with something which ft not dangerous to our country not dangerous unless we do not do it we do need very much to have this strengthening of our ability to apprehend drug smugglers who are destroying our society destroying our youth destroying our country"], [0.44680672883987427, 0.5531932711601257, 1, "today i am introducing a bill to reform the laws of the united states with respect to extradition current extradition laws have been on the books for well over a century and have never been reviewed in a comprehensive fashion according to both the departments of justice and state and leading practitioners and academics these provisions are not adequate in dealing with international crime control the bill i am offering for introduction is designed to facilitate reform in this area the subcommittee on crime which i chair will hold a hearing on this bill in the near future increased ease and frequency of intercontinental travel has created international law problems that were unforeseen by the congress of the 19th century in recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of extradition requests made by foreign countries for terrorists and for persons involved in drug trafficking improved international cooperation in prosecuting these types of offenses will very likely produce an even greater level of extraditlon demands in the future the current procedures carry forward the anomalies of a bygone era the inconveniences caused by these statutory deficiencies are relatively minor now but are likely to cause major problems in the future in addition the united states has undertaken negotiations and executed new extradition treaties that cannot be fully implemented under present law the modernization of extradition procedures would be an important step forward in implementing these international obligations this bill has been developed with the assistance of the departments of justice and state many of the ideas for reform in this area have come dif remaks e 5877 rectly from their suggestions among the suggestions made by the administration that have been incorporated are the followving first require that the attorney general act as complainant in extradition matters under current law a foreign governmentor someone claiming to be acting on behalf of such governmentcan initiate an extradition proceeding the suggested change is recognized practice in virtually every other country the proposed change will also avoid foreign policy problems that arise under current law second permit an arrest warrant to be issued when the location of the fugitive is not known this procedure will facilitate the efforts of law enforcement in locating persons sought for extradition including suspected terrorists third permit the commencement of extradition proceedings upon the issiance of a summons this procedure is appropriate when the fugitives location is known and the risk of flight is small this procedural device will aiso save money fourth set standards for the release of a person sought for extradition under current law there is no explicit treatment of the question of when and whetber to release a person sought for criminal activity by a foreign government the absence of statutory criteria for use by the courts has produced some inappropriate results the proposed release criteria takes into account the dangerouseness of the accused person ties to the community seriousness of the offense and the need to honor our solemn treaty obligations fifth permits fugitives to be temporarily extradited to the united states for trial and sentencing this change will assist law enforcement by allowing timely disposition of violations of american law under current law we would have to wait until any foreign sentence was served sixth establishes the right to counsel of accused persons and authorizes the appointment of counsel for indigents seventh clarifies the requirements of double criminality international law and our extradition treaties require that the offense that is the subject of the proceeding be an offense in both the requesting state and the united states the bill clarifies current law by providing that the alleged offenses must be an offense similar to a crime against a majority of the states or the united states the united states or against the laws of the state in which the suspect is found eighth permits either party to appeal the decisions of the district court under current law neither side may appeal as a practical matter however the defendant can obtain review through habeas corpu ls proceedings and the government by coinmencing a new proceeding direct appellate review will be more efficient ninth clarifies or codifies current extradition practices and sets forth clear procedures for use by the courts and the attorney general there is one area where the bill differs from the previous recommendations of the departments of justice and state treatment of the political offense exception and the application of defenses to extradition under current law virtually all of our extradition treaties provide that the united states does not have an obligation to return an alleged offender who has committed a political offense the federal district courts generally make this determination under current law the administration wants to change this practice to vest these determinations in the discretion of the secretary of state the bill i am introducing leaves the authority for making decisions about political offenses with the independent judicial branch while thcre are legitimate concerns about the possible adverse consequences of the current practice on the political offense question i believe they are adequately addressed in the bill the bill sets forth for the first time in federal law clear statutory criteria for the courts to use in determining a safeguard against possible abuse by guaranteeing the government the right to appeal these two changes should resolve most of the objections the affected agencies have to current law if the witnesses at our forthcoming hearings offer persuasive reasons for modifying the current law then such a change in the bill will be made i am confident that any bill that emerges will fashion an appropriate balance between the rights of the accused and the foreign policy needs of our overnment i extend an invitation to interested parties to comment on this bill comments or requests to testify should be made to the subcommittee on crime 207 cannon house office building washington d c 20515 or telephone 202 2251695 o"], [0.44712918996810913,

953 acre charles c deam wilderness concurrently the bill confirms the forest services april 16 1979 release of certain other roadless lands in the forest and continues their availability for nonwilderness types of multiple use as may be deemed appropriate through the national forest land management planning process i am especially gratified that we are able to recommend approval of this consensus bill today as s 2710 will complete action on a series of forest service and citizen group wilderness proposals in the hoosier national forest which date back to 1973 over the years the initial 16 727 acre forest service proposal was modified nearly a dozen times by various groups but no bill has ever passed congress in 1974 a 30 750 wilderness bill passed the senate but the house took no action subsequent compromise efforts failed to achieve total consensus until 1978 when the socalled 16 850 salt creek compromise was reached i was fortunate to be able to inspect the lands involved in the salt creek compromise in june of 1980 and it was my opinion that the compromise represented a reasonable proposal which would protect a solid core of lands possessing excellent opportunities for primitive recreation and management in their natural state however opposition to this compromise surfaced from the state department of natural resources which did not want some 3 200 acres of lands leased from the unitedstates army corps of engineers land included in the wilderness after more than a year of discussion indiana governor orr offered an alternative 12 953 acre proposal and that is the proposal before us today in s 2710 the need for designation of some wilderness in indiana should be apparent although the state is in excess of 20 million acres in size not a single acre is currently designated as wilderness most indiana residents must now drive over 1 day just to reach small designated wilderness areas in southern kentucky or southern illinois given these facts it is no wonder that many indiana residents have worked so long and hard to see a wilderness established in the hoosier national forest not only will wilderness designation provide opportunities for primitive recreation but it will insure that at least one area in the state of significant size will be protected from development and allowed to return eventually to a near virgin forest condition this will be a boon to scientific research and provide an outdoor classroom for various groups and institutions including indiana university which is located less than 15 miles from the proposed wilderness it will also provide habitat protection for the numerous wildlife species which have been shown to thrive in an unmanaged and undeveloped forest environment further wildnerness designation does not preclude sport hunting or nonconsumptive use of wildlife when such activities are conducted in a manner which preserve the untrammeled condition of the wilderness environment before concluding i should mention several features of s 2710 which deserve special comment because they relate to overall wilderness policy these issues are as follows name of wilderness s 2710 departs from the general policy followed by the committee on interior and insular affairs that wilderness areas not be named after individuals except for nationally recognized historical persons such as john muir jim bridger and bob marshall in the case of s 2710 however we are willing to make an exception in deference to the unanimous wishes of the indiana delegation to have the wilderness named after charles c deam mr deam was indianas first state forester the author of several books on the trees and shrubs of indiana and is known throughout the state for his conservation efforts release language as i mentioned earlier s 2710 not only designates the charles c deam wilderness but also confirms the april 1979 release of another roadless area in the hoosier national forestthe 7 000 acre mogan ridge area rare ii no 09342and continues its availabilitysince 1979for such nonwilderness types of multiple use as may be deemed appropriate through the national forest land management planning process the release formula found in section 4 of s 2710 is virtually identical to the formula that has already become law for national forest lands in alaska colorado and new mexico and has the same legal effect under this formula released lands may be managed for uses deemed appropriate in accordance with the land management plans prepared for such areas pursuant to the national forest management act further wilderness review of such released lands will not occur until the initial land management plans prepared pursuant to nfma are revised some 10 to 15 years after their implementation at which time nfma specifically requires a review and consideration of all multiple uses including wilderness of course such released lands will only be reviewed for wilderness potential if they still possess wilderness characteristics at such time as nfma plans are revised each 10 to 15 years twounit wilderness the proposed wilderness is actually designated in two units separated by the tower ridge road this road will remain open to the public with the wilderness units on either side in order to allow for maintenance of the road the offi clal wilderness boundary will be set back 100 feet north and south of the centerline of the tower ridge road private inholdings the proposed wilderness contains some small private inholdings pursuant to section 5 c of the wilderness act these inholdings may be acquired by the government only if the landowner concurs in the acquisition in short wilderness designation specifically prohibits any forced acquisition of inholdings by condemnation further s 2710 provides for adequate access to such inholdings in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the wilderness act in conclusion i strongly support s 2710 and note that the bill is endorsed by the entire indiana delegation governor orr the reagan administration and the environmental and other interest groups affected i think i have explained the bills provisions but those wishing further details should consult the house and senate committee reports on s 2710 finally i would like to particularly commend my friend and colleague lee hamilton for the diligent efforts he has put into resolving this controversial matter without his and the rest of the delegations consistent hard work and efforts to reach a compromise we would not be where we are

insert in the record the following profile of secretary of interior james watt written by elizabeth drew which appeared in the may 4 1981 issue of the new yorker magazine the article is remarkably well written and contains an excellent evaluation of the dangerous potential of the current secretary of the interior i urge my colleagues to take the time to rcad ms drews superb profile srcarrany warr the department of the interior has jurisdiction over roughly onefifth of all the land in the united statesmore than four hundred million acres most of it in the west and in alaska it is charged with both the preservation and the development of publicly held landa charter that has historically led to conflict over its mission it recommends which areas are to be used for parks wilderness wildlife refuges and other recreation areas and for grazing of livestock and for exploration for oil and other minerals it also administers mining and mineral leasing on an additional three hundred and seventy million acres lying under other federally and privately owned land plus another roughly one billion acres on the outer continental shelf it manages the national park system which consists of some three hundred parks covering more than eighty million acres it is in charge of the bureau of reclamation which promotes development of water resources particularly in the west and it runs the fish and wildlife service which is in charge of conserving migratory birds endangered species and other wildlife and supervises some four hundred wildlife refuges it has jurisdiction over stripmining policy it runs services involving outdoor recreation and national landmarks it influences policies involving the production consumption import export and stockpiling of minerals and it administers the bureau of indian affairs all these activities make interior one of the most controversial and sensitive departments in the government affecting as it does so many conflictins interests and a secretary of the interior has wide discretionary authority secretaries of the interior have ruined presidents and one albert b fall went to jail great stakes are involved in the departments decisions and many of the results of its actions are of course irreversible in recent years for a variety of reasons the department has become more controvers1l1 than ever in the west the controversy has been embodied in the sagebrush rebelliona political movement that helped ronald reagan carry every western state and that now has one of its avowed partisans james watt as secretary of the interior i am a part of the sagebrush rebellion through actions he has already taken or is planning watt intends to try to reverse federal policy across the spectrum of functions performed by his department to put less emphasis on preserving federal lands for wilderness areas and more on leasing them for drilling and mining to accelerate the distribution of federal lands on which states have existing claims and of parcels of laud they would like to obtain to speed up off ihore drilling to promote mineral exploraition watt was instrumental in the adninistrations recent decision to interrupt and reassess the united states participation in negotiating a law of the sea treaty to halt the acquisition of national parks and turn more of the management of existing ones over to private enterprise to relax regulations on stripminingr to reduce the requirements for assessing the environmental impact of driling for geothermal energy and to allow more killing ofwild horses and burros and also of predators and put less emphasis on the protection of endangered species the sagebrush rebellion in its ultimate form of protest calls for federal lands to be turned over to the states watt has said that this demand is a way of bringing pressure for changes in federal policies in his confirmation hearings he was somewhat ambiguous i do not see the need at this time for a massive transfer of public lands to state or local control or private interests if we do not shape up the management processes of these public lands then there probably ought to be a massive transfer i think some good management will handle those problems watt has also been influencing environmental energy an i even international policy beyond the boundaries of his depart ment according to white house aides watt was a lively and enthusiastic participant in the early cabinet meetings and offered opinions on a variety of questions the president they said was cuite pleased with him watt recommended greater budget cuts for his own department than had been suggested by the office of management and budget and he was placed in charge of the interagency cabinet council on natural resources and environment which includes representatives of the department of energy the department of agriculture and other departments and agencies the council will shape the administrations position on the forthcoming revision of the airpollution law which must be reauthorized this year and on water policy watt is effectively in charge of important energypolicy decisions such as the pending one on whether to deregulate the price of natural gas he supported the deregulation of naturalgas prices during previous government service recently the president appointed him to head the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations which was established in 1959 to examine relations among federal state and local governments and has done distinguished work in that field watts early actions have stirred up a storm but the few dispassionate observers one can find tend to agree at least in part with some of the things he seeks to do the question s how far he intends to go in this as in other areas of government those who supported various programs in the past did not attend to how they were being administered and are now on the defensive even som environmentalists agree that there is good reason to try to develop less cumbersome ways of administering some of the laws on the books one can find dispassionate observers who agree that procedures for granting leases for mineral exploration can and should be speeded up moreover it is the role of the environmental groups to sound the alarm to give the worstcase analysis of what anyone who differs with them is trying to do and to take the most adamant positions and many of the actions initiated by watt are only in their beginning stages more are to come after some of his appointees have been confirmed by congress several people who as worried are prepared to give him more time but it is clear that a number of the actions already initiated or being contemplated by the department of the interior as well as by related agencies could amount to a radical change in land conservation and environmental policiesmany of which have had an essentially bipartisan consensus behind them for many years some of the actions could upset delicate balances that have been painstakingly reached some could result in the transfer of substantial amounts of land and resources now deemed to be the domain of all of the people to a much smaller group some could result in very big gains for certain private interests watts personal style as well as his profes sional background has added to the controversy surrounding his appointme it and his management of the department thus far he comes across as smart certain of his views intense combative and suspicious to an unusual degree of those who do not agree with him and also of the career bureaucracy which includes many dedicated public servants there have been wholesale firings at the interior department and the career civil servants many of them experts have been cut out of decisionmaking we are not to become a part of the bureaucracy watt said in an interview in public opinion which is published by the american enter prise institute a couple of months ago he went on to say frequent cabinet meetings keep us isolated and in unity theres comfort in that when i go against my bureaucracy the issues are often against me but when i come back to the fold im nurtured in march addressing a group of people who run concessions in national parks he said the president was brought to power by a restlessness of the people because they needed change and he represents change and those oldtime liberals that dont want change are going to frustrate conservatives who want change every chance they can and weve got to change forty fifty years of bad government to ac complish that we fired every person in the department of the interior that was a presidential appointees i mean we cleaned every one of them out and then we started appointing good people forty or fifty years of bad government covers a lot of ground including several republican ad ministrations watt who grew up in wyoming is fortythree years old tall and bald he wears thick glasses and he is polite and contained one of his friends senator alan simpson republican of wyoming who is a most agreeable person insists that watt is a warm and sensitive man who has been treated unfairly by the environmentalists and in the press in the early nineteensixties watt worked for simpsons father milward simpson who was also a senator from wyoming and who served on the senate interior committee then in 1966 watt became a lobbyist for the chamber of commerce where he opposed the first national laws dealing with water and air pollution during the nixon and ford administrations watt served in the interior department and then on the federal power commission in both jobs his actions were controversial and led to a reputation justified or not for being prodevelopment uninterested in preserva tion and quick to remove subordinates who did not agree with him there is of course nothing wrong in and of itself in being prodevelopment obviously some resources have to be developed the real argument is over manner and degree over how quickly resources should be developed and how much attention should be paid to other considerations such as preserving resources for the future preserving the land around development areas setting aside land for recreation and protecting renewable resources like forests and rangelands in a rush to gain access to current resources future productivity can be damaged and if the emphasis is on developing oil and otherminerals now will america be more secure in the future these are issues that call for careful reasoned judgments everyone involved in these controversies it seems uses the word balance everyone says that he is for balance and everyone feels qualified to define it if one drew a chart of the philosophies of secretarles of the interior watts would be way off to one side following his government service watt was hired by joseph coors the president of the adolph coors company and a rightwing activist also an important backer of ronald reagan and ultimately a member of his kitchen cabinet to head the mountain states legal foundation which ia in denver and which coors founded in 1977 the purpose of the foundation which is nonprofit and taxexempt was watt said in 1977 to fight in the courts those bureaucrats and nogrowth advocates who create a challenge to individual liberty and economic freedoms in a much quoted speech he gave during his tenure at the mountain states foundation he said what is the real motive of the extreme environmentalists who appear to be determined to accomplish their objectives at whatever cost to so ciety is it to simply protect the environ ment is it to delay and deny energy development is it to weaken america watts argument which he made many times was that the west held virtually all the nations energy resources and that because of the actions being taken by extrem ists to delay or stop the orderly develop ment of energy resources the nation is likely to suffer energy shortages and thus severe economic hardship his thesis was that when this happens the politicians in washington will seize on the crisis and take whatever action is needed to extract energy from the western states in order to light and heat the east and to maintain jobs in the midwest and on the east coast he continued i fear for our ecology in thu west and for our life style when the eco nomic pressures start strangling the eastern states due to short supplies of energy their political leadership will come after our resources one person who knows watt says he sincerely believes that he is standing between this country and disaster his beliefs are close to those of corporate americas because he believes that america would be better off if the companies were unshackled to do what they want this made him just right for the mountain states legal foundation the foundation is an offspring of the national legal center for the public interest to which coors has contributed and on whose board he serves as vicechairman the national legal center organized and initially funded several regional legal centers of which mountain states was one the legal centers remain associated the first chariman of the national legal center was j robert fluor the chairman of the fluor corporation which is an international engineering and construction company the fluor corporation is also in the coal business provides drilling services and has been attempting to acquire other mineral companies the current chairman of the national legal center is charles barber chairman of asarco inc formerly the american smelting and refining company and one of the nations largest mining concerns the coors company not only makes beer but has invested in coal oil and naturalgas leases its mining affiliate has stripmining plans pending at the interior

they had tempt for everyone who has chosen to work been drawn up by the carter administra for the government theres very much an tion under court order to stop the practice usversusthem mentality

set by the rec he has with his family he conducts his lamation law an official order to delay the business briskly and likes to make decisions new regulations has been issued over the quickly says one interior official hes signature of one of watts deputies but the smart but not particularly analytical a lot department announced the action as watts of people are impressed by him because he watt

cessionaires he stressed that he would make and became a charismatic christiaq he decisions without hcaitationp im out to spelled out his basic philosophy in public make decisions and i will make them quickopinion watt declined to be interviewed ly i make lots of decisions he also for this article as follows said if we need to change personnel to aci come to washington with a western complish a more aggrerssive concessioners states perspective we feel that our individ program we will changes the people we ual freedoms have been reduced considerably mean business and when you rad the press by the power of washington to set values youre going to find that i can be cold and market forces and the individual properly calculating and indeed i can but we are dset values we feel the pressure of

much question that watt rethese values by limidting our access to these flects the reagan administrations outlook lands for market use or personal pleasure but other cabinet secretaries also represent i believe strongly in market forces thie the presidents views in a different mannier presidents decision to deregulate crude oil a white house aide who works on energh was symbolic and important i pushed very environment and naturalresources issues hard for that decision economically its recently told some environmentalists that not that big a deal but the symbolism is im the attitude of this administration is that portant will reagan allow market forcesto the 1980 election was about privatization versus publicization and that we won watt told public opinion no other secretary of the interior in recent times at least has had a president who understands my department like ronald reagan does hes a westerner fifty per cent of his state is owned and managed by the federal govern ment when i said i want to do this i want to do that he replied sic em watt was chosen secretary of the interior after clifford hansexa republican who has been both governor of and senator from wyomingdropped out of consideration because he did not wantto sell his familys valuable permits to graze cattle on federal lands in order to comply with conflictofinterest regulations when hansens appointment fell through watt was proposed by a group of western senators who knew him from his earlier work and was interviewed by senator paul laxalt of nevada the presidents close friend according to people working on the transition it was understood that when it came to selections for the inteder department laxalts word was it laxalt tells me that he had known watt only by reputation but that after he inter viewed him i almost singleshotted himi phoned the president and said hes our man at that point laxalt had the enthusiastic concurrence of coors who along with other wealthy reagan supporters was helping the president select his cabinet laxalt says that coors had been backing another manthat apparently watt had not occurred to him laxalt told me as soon as i called joe about jim he agreed immediately and enthusiastically backed his appointment reagan who did not know watt then met with him for about twenty minutes and selected him alan simpson said to me when we were talking about who should have the job someone said if youve got a bear 9f a job to do why not hire a grizzly they got a grizzly when they hired jim when i asked laxalt what watts mission was he said simply to pacify the west this gets to why the west is so angry and what the sagebrush rebellionof which laxalt is 4 leader and with which reagan identified himself during the campaign count me in as a rebel is all about not all of the west is angry of course nor does the sagebrush rebellion represent all of the west it is concentrated in the rocky mountain states and represents a combina tion of forces oil and mining interests that want more access to the minerals and other resources they believe to be on federally owned western lands interests that want federally owned land for commercial development livestock interests that want more land and ranchers who want to be freer of restrictions on grazing on federal lands cowboys and farmers who are traditionally suspicious of the federal govermnent and commercial interests that seek to overturn a number of federal policies and in recent years these forces have been fed by the new right political movement a western senator says that the sagebrush rebellion represents the old cowboy whos not angry so much as independent and suspicious plus a new force fed by the new right and raw commercialismthe old landgrab issues of the nineteenth century reemerging one interior department official describes it as an attempt on the part of some opportunistic politicians to grab some land capitalizing on some very legitimate complaints and frustrations on the part of local people it has some roots in resentment of the easta feelint that the east is the center of the environmentalists and that easterners think that westerners if left to their own devices would stripmine grand teton the environmental movement is strong in the west of course simpson says the toughest thing to handle is the paternalism from other areas which think that we really dont know what a jewel of a place we have and that they are going to help us preserve that jewel the sagebrush rebellion has some roots in restntrmntsome of it apparently justifiedof a oureaucracy that is felt to be unresponsive to the ranchers with whom it deals in administering the federal lands and it has some roots in commercial interests that have recently come to see value in certain of those lands the argument is over the disposition and management of the public lands currently managed by the bureau of land management in the department of the interior this agency manages almost seventy per cent of all the land in nevada fortytwo per cent of the land in utah roughly a quarter of the land in wyoming oregon and idaho these are the lands that were long considered the least valuable or attractive public lands and have not been set aside as national parks or reserved for forest preserves by the forest service or given away or sold off over the years homesteaders didnt want them until about a decade ago the federal policy was essentially to dispose of these lands then a variety of people began to realize that they contained a number of important resources ecological and environmental resources renewable resources such as timber and forage land water resources recreational opportunities and valuable minerals the lands are estimated to contain mineral assets worth hundreds of billions of dollars eighty per cent of the nations oil shale and forty per cent of its coal reserves large deposits of oil natural gas and uranium ore tar sands and geothermal heat at the same time that commercial groups were taking a greater interest in these lands the nations population was increasing and the demand for recreational areas was growingand all this coincided with a heightening of the environmental movement the first earth day was in 1970 a move developed in congress to establish a more comprehensive policy toward the disposition and management of those federal lands and in 1976 the federal land policy and management act was passed this law said for the first time that it was in the public interest for the federal government to retain and manage the lands instead of disposing of them and it established procedures for deciding which lands should be set aside for wilderness areas and which should be released for other uses the decisionl are made by congress on the basis of recommendations by the department even those lands which are set aside for wilderness areas can be drilled for oil and gas and other minerals with certaln stipulations as to how the land around drilling sites is to be treated land that is awaiting designation as suitable or unsuitable for a wilderness area can be explored for oil and minerals with certain restrictions that are designed to prevent the land from being made unsuitable for wilderness of the almost hundred and seventyfive million acres that the bureau of land management has studied to see if they should be released as unsuitable for wilderness all but about twentyfive million haive been released but watt and the mining companies say that the restrictions still go too far and watt has acted to loosen them it is not quite accurate to say as watt and other critics of federal land policy do that federal land has been locked up for a single purpose by which they mean wildernessand that exploration for resources is prohibited on it one career official at interior says they are reacting to impressions rather than facts it stands to reason that people who had become accustomed to the old system would resent the new one before the 1976 act grazers and miners had relatively free access to these lands some parts of them were being overgrazed and ruined for future use it also stands to reason that various interests that wanted to possesss or exploit these lands would be upset a permit to graze on federal lands is a very good deal since the federal government generally charges cattlemen less per acre than private landholders do previous administrations have tried to raise the price of grazing fees but the reagan administration despite its emphasis on cutting the budget and its nod in the direction of charging users fees has made no such effort the politics of such a decision are fairly obvious the rental cost of an oil or gas lease is also an attractive arrangementa dollar an acre per year if oil or gas is produced on federal lands the federal government receives a royalty reductions of grazing allotments and of access to public lands for drilling for oil and gas were among the subjects of suits watt brought when he was at the mountain states legal foundation the complaints about the bureau of land managements overseeing of lands include homey stories about a rancher who was not allowed to put a fence up about a miner who was penalized for building a road three feet in the wrong direction about a rancher who opened his land to hunters who were then forbidden to hunt on adjacent public land simpson points out that some westerners are also disturbed because when federal rulings are challenged in the federal courts the appeals end up in the federal cir cuit court of appeals in washington rather than in a court in cheyenne wyoming most of the complaints however have to do with restrictions on grazing and with delays in or restrictions on getting access to minerals laxalt said to me iecently westerners should be more involved in the decisionmaking that was essentially the situation we had before the 1976 law was passed implicit in the old system was the idea that the allocation of grazing lands would be left to westerners the 1976 law had the decisions taken over by the activisttype managers in the interior department they made decisions about where there would be grazing about predator control about wild horses essentially the same thing is true of mining by virtue of tremendous withdrawals of land primarily for wilderness a great deal of valuable property was being denied for use the hostility just grew and grew into the sagebrush rebellion it wasnt just administrative turmoil it was political if there was one thing that burned jimmy carter in the west it was this in 1979 the nevada state legislature passed a bill supported largely by miners and stockmen that called for the turning over of federally owned lands to the states and in the following year similar legislation was adopted in utah arizona wyoming and new mexico bills to this effect have also been introduced in congress sponsors of such legisiation argue that these lands belonged to the states in the first place others argue that people who say this have their history wrongthat these lands were originally owned by the federal government or were given to it as part of the arrangements for achieving statehood the idea of turning the lands over to the states horrifies many people of course they argue that there is a national interest in the way these lands are utilized and assume that the lands would be yielded to the strongest economic interests within a given state richard lamm the governor of colorado and a existed because of what bureau officials and democrat has said the west went into previous other interior officials believed to the union with its eyes open knowing well be the requirements of the law the major these lands were reserved in the enabling ity of the people who work for the bureau acts that made us states we waived any in the west are westerners but most of rights to these lands we didnt want the them are trained as foresters

it and plaints against the federal landholders has like timber companies build access roads now resulted in an attempted land grab by through it it is the role of the bureau to remining companies large ranchers and land solve these conflictsa process that can speculators and oil companies take time shortly after watt assugied some career people in the bureau of land office he held a series of large meetings management recognize that some of the with department employees and told them complaints are valid and are struggling to among other things that any of them who make the agency more responsive they say were committed to a singlepurpose use of that the process of deciding whether an land should seek work elsewhere but it is area should be set aside as wilderness the funciton of the wildlife biologists and should be speeded up and that the backlog the geologists on the staff to say that if of applications for exploration or drilling drilling for example is permitted in a crfor minerals should be dealt with more rap ta place an endangered speces or a geoidly but they say they need more people logical formation might be destroyedto be to handle these things watt however cu advocates in a process in which a decision is the agencys budget for management of the made further up the line now some of lands he has frequently referred to the these people arefearful of doing their job bureau of land management as arrogant shortly after watt came i he fired fiftyand he has proceeded in a way that under one staff members of the solcitors officemines the morale of the very people he the office that gives opinions on how the needs in order to deal with the complaints laws are to be interpreted and helps the de of the westerners a theory is held by prtment build the caes that are then some in the agencyand they concede that brought by the justice department against it may result from paranoiathat watt is violators he explained his action by saying setting them up for failure so that he can that the carter administration had exceedaccept the more radical proposals of the ba ed hiring levels carter administration offigebrush rebels watt has said that the cals say that the levels were exceeded in sagebrush rebellion helps create the atten terms of numbers but not in terms of the tion on those basic problems which con budget and that the firings were political gress needs to address and that it will be if the office was too large some have augmy objective to manage these lands as a gested it could have been reduced by attrgood neighbor to eliminate that friction and tion the solicitors office of course decidlet the sagebrush rebellion die because of ed on the regulations that watt challenged friendly relations when he was asked in court when he was with the mountain during his confirmation hearings what his states legl foundation and that annoy so inclination would be if he was asked to tes many ranchers and mining companies after tify on legislation providing for the transfer watt took office as secretary he asked of federally owned lands to the states or pri some interior employees why they did vate entities watt replied my present in something in a certain way and was told clination would be that that would be a pre that they acted in accordance with an opinmature piece of legislation that would be a ion issued by the solicitors office in 1979 divisive force in congress unlikely of being watt replied that the solution to that was passed he also said if i failed in my mis easythey would just get a new opinion he sion pressures would be so great on you sen added that one thing he would insist on was ators to do that that you would have no that the solicitors not sit around deliberateother alternative ly misinterpreting the law some of the anecdotes about the bureau watt has said that he will seek to release of land managements recalcitrance are not more land for exploration and developmentd altogether true watt had one that he par the department has already taken stepsticularly liked to tellabocut how long it by getting a new solicitors opinion reintersupposedly took a school to be able to buld~ preting the lawto relax the environmental an athletic field on federal landand he constraints on oil drilling and mineral excontinued to tell it after his office had been ploration on some of the public lands these informed that the facts were otherwise constraints were the subject of a suit the when a congressman asked bureau officials mountain states legal foundation brought about it in a hearing and was told the facts against the interior department douglas he suggested that watt get another exam baldwin watts spokesman and longtime ple and the interior department headquar friend told me that the new regulations ters sent a request to a meeting of state dl will perite exploration even though there rectorsof the bureau in phoenix to provide will be some degradation of the environone many of the examples of the bureaus ment the department also has under conunwillingness to allow a fence or a road to sideraton aprocess by which congress be built are true and this unwillingness and would beasked to release lands unsuitable many of the bureaus restrictions on mining for wilderness while potential wilderness in potential or actual wilderness areas have areas werestill being stuilied but some members of congress want to continue the practice of considering the two types of areas at the same time so as not to find that they had foreclosed the possibility of saving wilderness lands in certain areas the real question is what sort of balance watt will want to strike though congress acts on interiors suggestions as to which areas should be set aside for wilderness and which should not the shape of the proposals it receives from interior can affect its decisions and there have been reports that watt will recommend no further setting aside of land for wilderness area at all baldwin told me that that would be consistent with his phllosophythat this country has enough recreation areas and there is no need for more baldwin continued he has said many times that public lands suitable for such development should be developed for multipurposes the secretary has taken personal charge of regulatory revision well say not only what regulatory actions are wrong but what solicitors opinions are wrong watt has expressed concern that the united states is not sufficiently aggressive in developing its strategic mineral resources and has become dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers he has told congress i plan to end unnecessary and burdensome regulations now frustrating americas mineraldevelopment programs he has called for a minerals policy that involves not simply the establishment of emergency government action in the face of a nonfuel minerals crisis such as war market disruption or price manipulation but the adoption of policies that protect american jobs and investments improve our balance of trade revitalize the nations economy and provide for the security of foreignmineral imports he has told a congressional subcommittee that the department of the interior must be the amicus for the minerals industry in the court of federal policymakingnot as a representative of private mining interests per se but as a spokesman for the very real public interest involved in the protection and preservation of a strong minerals sector again the godl of developing minerals is in itself unexceptionable up to a point but the question remains of whether it will be done without undue damage with a fair return to the government and with consideration of what would be involved in getting at the minerals there is also the question of whether it makes sense to go all out to extract strategic minerals nowas the mineral companles would likeor is it more in the national interest to identify mineral deposits and leave them in the ground until it becomes clear that they are needed watt objected to going ahead with the law of the sea treaty because he felt that it represented too great a concession to the third world moreover the administration was under strong pressures from large mining companies to renegotiate the treaty the new administration made its position known on the eve of what was expected to be the final session on the treaty at the united nations and fired the entire negotating team the negotiations had been going on under bipartisan auspices since 1973 elliot richardson who played a variety of roles in former republican administrations had been the chief united states negotiator it is widely agreed that the mining companies need a treaty in order to go forward with deepseabed mining be cause of the enormous costs and the risks of competing claims the question before the administration which now has the treaty under review is whether the companies can get what they want and also get a treaty ane 9 1981 watt has considerable discretionary authority in leasing certain lands for exploration and development of oil and gas he has taken steps to speed up the process of granting leases for exploration of the outer continental shelf and in early february he proposed making four areas off the northern california coast available for oil drilling the four were among five california areas that had been under consideration for some time and last year cecil andrus the secretary of the interior in the carter administration proposed making just one of them availablean area to the south of the others exploration of the others would involve drilling in waters off such areas as big sur point reyes and mendocino the agencies under andrus had recommended that these areas also be drilled but estimated that most of the potential oil and gas were contained in the one area andrus proposed andrus decided that the expected yield in the four other areas did not justify the environmental hazardsthe danger of oil spills the threat to sea life and birds watts proposal was protested not only by environmental groups but also by governor jerry brown and by a majority of californias congressional delegationincluding such conservative republicans as senator 8 i hayakawa and representative barry goldwater j necently a decision on these new areas was deferred watts aides say that andruss decision was made for political reasons watt also has discretionary authority to dispose of certain federal lands and in this area as in other areas he moved quickly the interior department may sell off to state and local governments parcels of federally owned land that is near privately owned land for parks municipal facilities or community expansion in his second week on the job watt write to western governors inviting them to identify parcels of federally owned land needed to meet com munity needssuch as land for community expansion and for schools hospitals and parks if these needs could not be met under existing authority watt wrote i am prepared to pursue vigorously legislative and regulatory changes if necessary to meet your needs the offer is unprecedented and does not indicate whether watt intends interior to take into account the possibility that some of the parcels of land may be of great value and to follow existing law and regulations governing what the states might have to pay for the property speedy action on all requests could result in the transfbr at low cost of some valuable public land the responses that have come in to interior thus far indicate that some governors and local communities have interpreted the invitation broadly new mexico has asked for land at no charge that communities plan to turn around and sell to developers one community in california is proposing to acquire land free that it has said it might then sell off to a developer watt has also begun proceedings that could result in the transfer of a very large amount of valuable land to the state of utaha transaction that could set a precedent for similar action in other states the transaction arises in part from the fact that the federal government still owes some states some land on the basis of arrangements that were made when they acquired statehood when western states entered the union the federal government gave them specific sections of land in each township primarily for the purpose of building schools if the designated lands were already committed for other useshad been set aside for national forests or parks or indian reservations or had been given to the railroadsthe states involved were entitled to select other lands instead some states such as nevada simply sold off the lands they were given some claims for land in lieu of the lands originally designated are still pending in part because it has taken the states a long time to decide which land they wanted or whether they wanted any and in part because such exchanges are studied for the value of the lands involved and hearings are conducted for all parties that might be affected eight states still have a total of slightly over six hundred thousand acres due themranging from small amounts wyoming and south dakota are owed just over a thousand acres each to quite substantial ones the largest claim is that of utah two hundred and twentyseven thousand acres and utah has decided that it wants some other land as well states may seek to exchange some of their land for federal landfor example to consolidate each of the two kinds of holdings but there is a very large question of what consideration is to be given to the value of the federal lands those states are seeking a few years ago utah tried to claim over two hundred thousand acres of federal lands containing highly valuable oilshale deposits as the lands due it in lieu of its original federal grants the interior department re4ected the claim and utah sued arguing that the secretary should have no discretion to determine which federal lands could be claimed the issue reached the supreme court which ruled last year in utah v andrus that the settlement could not simply be on an acreforacre basis but must be on the basis of roughly equivalent value now governor scott matheson of utah is engaged in discussions with watt about ideas that utah has for overcoming the supreme court decision and arranging not only for a transfer of the lands in lieu of the original grants but also for a trade of a substantial amount of federal lands for lands owned by the state matheson a democrat supported watt enthusiastically during his confirmation hearings on february 18th matheson wrote to watt enclosing a memorandum written by the assistant attorney general of utah that he described as concerning the statewide landexchange program which we discussed in your office on february 10 matheson said in his letter that he was in general agreement with the memorandum and concluded i think we both view this subject as an historic opportunity for the publiclands states as well as the united states to solve many of their landmanagement problems and to create vastly improved relationships that should endure for decades to come the memorandum proposes that utah identify as lands to be acquired from the public domain lands and minerals having a sufficient value so that we could actually do something with them and derive some substantial income from them it goes on to say that value is not a vital federal interest and there should be no reason why federal lands of high value would not be suitable for state acquisition simply because of such high value it suggests that the state offer in return school lands that we own but do not want or cannot use and a number of what it considers unliquidated claims among these claims are lands that utah argues it would have received if the 1976 federal land policy and management act had not been passed it argues that at the time utah became a state and up until the passage of the 1976 law the federal policy was to dipose of unreserved public lands and that utah was therefore economically damaged by the new law the memorandum asserts that because of these claims we are justly entitled to values substantially in excess of the current net value that we will offer in exchange for the selection rights that we will agree to release the memorandum goes on to suggest that there be no effort to make exhaustive and detailed appraisals of the land to be exchanged because such appraisals would be timeconsuming and also partially irrelevant in that we will ask congress to agree to the proposed overall statewide plan or prop als in other words congress is to be ask d to approve post facto an elaborate plan that will have been worked out between utah and the interior depart ment and not bother with the details the state memorandum suggests developing a number of proposals each with a different ratio of benefits for utah as opposed to those for the federal government starting with fivetoone it warns against making a proposal where the values were equal or roughly equal because it might be too tempting for congress to opt for the latter alternative the meraorandum suggests that a legal brief be written to be used as a lobbying tool to justify the value discrepancy we would seek it says that this brief will be a subjective document prepared by one advocating a particular cause drafted to persuade and convince members of congress the memorandum suggests that the state proceed independent and apart from federal regulations and procedures reason ing that since congress would have ap proved the states proposals there would be no violation of any law or regulation the career staff worried about the implications of this proposal warned watts office and drafted a response for him saying that the department would have to give the proposal further study before the letter was signed by watt a second one arrived from utah on march 19th matheson wrote to watt referring to our telephone discussion last week he went on to say i am very pleased that you have agreed to proceed with my proposal to block up stateowned lands in utah that is to consolidate them through a comprehensive exchange with the department of the interior he proposed a speedy schedule for action and said i assure you that we are committed to making this a successful endeavor and a model for other publiclands states he also said it is important to remember during the process that the question of value is secondary our responsibility is to provide the congress with a rationale for the final package not an accounting of dollars or acres if we proceed as though this is a businessas usual exchange on a massive scale the project is doomed on february 25th watt met with the governors of eleven western states and held a press conference afterward governor robert list of nevada told the press conference in all candor i cant recall a single instance in which the governors raised issues that the secretary did not agree watt stirred up a major storm by halting the expenditure of funds for the acquisition of land for national parksincluding parks whose purchase congress had authorized the carter administration had recommended that three hundred and thirtyfive million dollars be spent on acquiring parks this year watt reduced the sum to fortyfive million dollars to be used in special cases his action not only would halt the acquisi tion of new parks but would leave some existing ones such as the cape cod national seashore and the redwood national park incomplete it was when reagan was run ning for governor of california that he made the remark a hundred thousand acres of redwood trees are an awful lot of trees to look at if youve seen one youve seen them all watts position is that the ii 2821 h 2822 government must learn to manage what it owns before it seeks to acquire more land however his decision to acquire no more parks may be a permanent policy baldwin told me that watt believes that we have already protected most of the truly unique lands watt has also proposed to halt funding for the acquisition of parks in urban areas his position is that these are playgrounds unsuitable for consideration as national parks this is another area in which some dispassionate people feel that watt has something of a point but also that he is carrying things much too far and has come up with a simplistic and short sighted solution these people who include conservationminded democrats maintain that congress had got in the habit in recent years pf authorizing the purchase of parks that could not be described as national jewels that a bit of porkbarrelling was going on traditionally the interior department was supposed to recommend twelve national parks to congress each year and congress added to the list if some itate or local areas desire more parks these people say they should pay for them some of them say that there are less expensive ways of allocating areas for recreationthat is by designating them wilderness reas however watt may not want any more wilderness areas either baldwin says that watts general view is that we have enough of each type of ecological system already set aside watt also plans to close down the youth conservation corps which has offered maintenance jobs in na tional parks and wilderness areas to poor young people the people who agree that congress has gone too fast say however that it is one thing to slow down the acquistion of park land another to stop it altogether and if land is to be acquired in the futureassuming it is still availableit will cost all the more others argue that the population is growing that we are running out of land suitable for parks and that state and local governments are not likely to buy the land they point out that watt complains that some parks are overcrowded and yet refuses to add to the inventory they say there is a national interest in having more parks available they cite theodore roosevelt who was the first president to champion the establishment of national parks and point out that the parks have been called the lungs of the land former senator gaylord nelson now the chairman of the wilderness society says if you stop the acquisition of park lands now where will you be in fifty years when the population of the country has doubled they point out that the acquisition of parks was maintained through the nixon and ford administrations and that watts action reverses a longstanding tradition and some are inclined to suspect that his action stems from concerns other than good manage ment some environmentalists say they suspect that watts intention is to diminish the size of national parks that contain timber or oil resources baldwin says that even though there are a lot of mineral resources in some national parks watt would never allow them to be opened for exploration or development baldwin also says theres probably a treasure trove in yellowstone park but watt would never allow it to be gone afterand congress wouldnt allow it there may of course be valuable land adjacent to existing national parksland that under the new policy would not be acquired for park expansion watt has said that he might consider the transfer of some national parks to state and local governmentswhich may or may not have the funds or may decide they dont want to use their funds to maintain the parks a stir has also occurred over some re for those already listed the new adinismarks that watt madd in early march to tration dismissed the environmentally orthe conference of national park conces ented members of a delegation preparing to stoners watt told the private concession attend an international convention on enalres we are going to ask you to be in dangered species in late february in new volved in areas that you havent been al delhi and replaced them with people more lowed to be involved in before even those interested in hunting and in the commercial who say that watt may have a point con uses of animals the united states ended up cerning the purchase of more land for na changing its previous positions on the protional parks are appalled at the idea of turn tection of certain species of whales and all ing over more management of the existing parrotsopposing most of the other nations national parks to private concessionaires represented the interior department is whose motivation is not the same as that of also moving to take certain afican leopards the national park service pans of the park off the endangered list thus permitting service who believe that it may represent them to be hunted for sport and it is the government at its best argue that it is moving to lift a ban in effect since 1974 on crucial to preserve the tradition of the the importation of kangaroo hides the trained park service ranger in his smokey united stlktes used to be a major importer the bear hat greeting people

over a number of policies and some of the disputes have resulted in decisions against the company crowell has advocated an increase in the cutting of timber in national forests by lumber companies and has been a critic of the forest service he has denounged the idea of setting aside some of the forest land for wilderness areas as a concept that originated with a surprisingly small band of devotees who over the years preached their cause with articulate persuasiveness and with unremitting fervor and zeal even some republicansand they include lawyers representing corporate clientswho seek changes in the way laws in these areas have been administered are concerned about some of these appointments they are concerned that things will be carried so far as to cause a reaction that would make what they see as legitimate change impossible certain federal officialssuch as members of the joint chiefs of staff or the head of a consumerprotection agencyare meant to perform advocacy rules but most federal positions require administrators who will weigh and balance interests the pattern that has appeared in the sphere of resources and the evironment is that positions that require judiciousness and a sensitive balancing of interests have been filled with dedicated advocatesadvocates at one end of the spectrum and advocates whose former clients stand to gain a great deal from their decisions a number of conservative republicans who could have been named secretary of the interior would not have drawn the electricity that reagans choice has some true conservatives suggest that what watt may be setting out to do is not truly conservativethat a true conservative would be more concerned with preserving our heritage there is more of a consensus even within his own department for changes in direction and emphasis than watt may think but if he goes at his job with hostility toward real and imagined opponents operates in isolation is driven by ideological fervor and is hellbent on taking action for the sheer sake of taking action he is headed for trouble some people in interior and outside including environmentalists havent given up on watt yet some even hold out the hope that he will be able to make sensible changes in policy and calm the west down without giving away the national store and will thereby do some real good but he may lack the temperament or the flexibility to do thisand in any case intentionally or not he is the instrument of forces that are bigger than he is in this area as in others there is a danger to the reagan administration and its allies in

light of the controversy surrounding the presidents claim that the internal revenue service has no legal standing todeny taxexempt status to private schools which discriminate on the basis of race i want to share with my colleagues some of the statements made during yesterdays hearing by the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights which clarify and articulate the existing legal basis for the irs to deny exemptions supporting the argument that existing law compels and obligates the irs to deny tax exemptions the honorable arthur s flemming chairman of the unitedstates commission on civil rights stated this decision by the executive branch is inconsistent in our judgement with the executives constitutional obligation and oath of office to faithfully execute our nations laws the executive branch has acted without appropriate regard for a coequal branch of government whose province and duty as chief justice marshall declared in marbury v madison is to say what law is we do not need new legislation to set forth once again the policy of nonsupport on the part of the federal government of schools that practice racial discrimination what we do need is vigorous implementation by the executve branch of the policy set forth in the constitution title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 and the irs code as defined by the federal courts flemming went on to say that the commission believes that the president should direct the irs to comply with the mandate of the federal courts and continue to deny tax exemptions to private schools that discriminate on the basis of race no federal judge has suggested that new legislation is needed in order to strengthen the legal foundation on which this mandate rests another distinguished witness mr carr ferguson former assistant attorney general in charge of the tax division of the department of justice stated the federal tax laws now on the books have been interpreted by every federal appellate court which has considered the issue as prohibiting federal tax exemption benefits for schools with racially discriminatory policies accordingly new tax laws are unnecessary to continue the governments consistent position of the last decade that such private schools do not qualify as tax exempt organizations under section 501 c 3 of the internal revenue code carr went on to say that instead of calling for new legislation the congress should leave to irs and the federal courts the reasoned systematic enforcement of the settled interpretations of existing statutes equally compelling and factual was the testimony of mr e richard larson staff counsel of the american civil liberties union mr larson stated the american civil liberties union disagrees with the presidents position in the aclus view the law most certainly includes the fifth amendment title iv of the civil rights act of 1964 and the rulings of the supreme court and of the lower federal courts the primary prohibition against federal government involvement direct or indirect in racial discrimination is the equal protec tion component of thepifth amendment to the unitedstates constitution the constitution has been consistently applied by the federal courts and interpreted by congress to deny government aid to racially discriminatory private schools larson emphasized thatthe decision green v connally 330 f supp 1150 d d c 1971 aftd sub nom cott v green 404 unitedstates 997 1971 did not occur in isolation but followed three other threejudge court decisions which had ruled that it was unconstitutional for govern ment to aid racially

emphasized that congress has already noted its approval of the green decision as he stated in 1976 congress added 8501 i to the code which explicitly denies tax exempt status to social clubs that discriminate against any person on the basis of race color or religion this legislation specifically overturned a contrary district court construction of the code the senate report on the private club provision cites green as the leading case on the issue of private schools that discriminate on the basis of race not qualifying for tax exemptions so not only is there constitutional authority for the irs to act numerous court rulings based on these constitutional provisions and the actions of this legislative body all give a foundation on which the irs can stand both the treasury and the irs in fact remain bound by the courts ruling interpreting the constitution and other laws as requiring the denial of taxexampt status to racially discriminatory private schools clearly the issue is not a lack of legal standing on the part of irs the real issue is the unwillingness of the chief executive to exercise his sworn constitutional oath to uphold the laws our land there is one final issue which should be clarified some of my colleagues expressed concern that since the irs has placed new applications for private school tax exemptions on hold this may delay the approval of applications from parochial schools and other schools which do not racially discriminate we contacted the irs public affairs office they said that this was not the case only applications from schools which have a policy of racial discrimination have been placed on hold all other applications are being processed without delay schools which do not racially discriminate are unaffected the president should act and

intercircuit tribunal of the unitedstates courts of appeals the proposed legislation will provide necessary help where it is needed most in the federal judicial system at the appellate level i am pleased that the chairman of my committee mr rodino and two minority members on my subcommittee mr railsback and mr butler have joined in cosponsoring this proposal the intercircuit tribunal of the unitedstates courts of appeals act is a modest idea which uses for the most part existing judicial resources the new panel also will rely on existing manpower in the unitedstates marshals servic it therefore will be extremely low in cost the tribunal will be composed of between 14 and 22 circuit judges who are in regular active service or who are senior judges the judges are to be designated by the chief justice of the united states the tribunal is a patch that fits neatly in the larger tapestry of the federal judiciary the new name symbolizes this fit rather than creating a national court of appeals with transfer jurisdiction from the other courts of appealswhich actually suggests to some a lowered status for the existing excircuit courtsthe tribunal will have reference jurisdiction from the supreme court of the united otates thus all petitions for review continue to be routed to the supreme court furthermore after the rendering of a judgment by the intercircuit tribunal a petition for certiorari may once again be filed in the supreme court in the final analysis therefore any argument that this new court would act as a gatekeeper and redurce access to the supreme court must fail analysis the supreme court will remain in the words of chief justice earl warren th~e ultimate tribunal to which all citizens poor or rich may submit their claims moreover the proposed legislation dovetails neatly with the proposal to create a court of appeals for the federal circuit which presently is moving n through both the house and the senate and which hopefully wvill be enacted into law during the 97th congress sonmc commentators have argued that that bill is a national court of appeals in disguise the legislation that i am introducing today is further evidence that that argument is specious the intercircuit tribunal will be a temporary entity since it is sunsetted after 5 years due to the courts experimental nature there are reportback provisions so that congress might determine whether the court has been a failure or a success before discussing the reasons for the legislation i briefly would like to delineate its background in 1971 chief justice warren burger acting in his napacity as chairman of the federal judicial center appointed a sevenmember study group on the caseload of the supreme court the socalled freund group studied the myriad problems affecting the supreme court and submitted recommendations for change in 1972 in 1973 the congress created a commission on revision of the federal court appellate system called the hruska commission after its chairman to study the structure and internal procedures of the federal circuit courts of appeal in different forms the freund group and the hruska commission both recommended the creation of a national court of appeals their recommendation was in response to a finding by both commissions that serious caseload problems existed in the federal appellate system requiring the immediate attention of congress shortly thereafter in 1977 my subcommitteethe subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justiceheld 7 days of oversight hearings on the state of the judiciary and access to justice we received testimony from individuals who had participated in the foundation work on the freund group and the hruska commisoion testimony also was heard from the policymaking arm of the federal judiciary the judicial conference of the united states because of the serious nature of the questions considered by the subcommittee the chief justice of the united states warren e burger participated by submitting a written statement into the record the testimony and statements presented by the respected witnesses confirmed that the federal judiciary was indeed suffering from endemic overload as observed in a department of justice report submittted into the re rd by former solicitor general robert bork the federal courts however now ftxce a crisis of overload a crisis so seriour that it threatens the capacity of the federal system to function as it should this is not a crisis for the courts alone it is a crisis for litiganti who seek justice for claims of humrnn rights for the rule of law and it is therefore a crisis for the nation as regards the appellate capacity of the federal court system this overload was described as having especially deleterious effects one of the main functions of appellate courts is to insure uniformity and consistency in the law by resolving conflicts in decisions between or among trial courts or lowcr appellate courts the supreme courtwhich of course sits at the apex of the federal judicial systemcan devote plenary consideration only to about 150 cases a year hundreds of other petitions from the circuit courts have to be left unsettled some of these appeals are of high national priority or identify serious splits among the circuits some concern individual rights guaranteed by the constitution and sonmc relate to the delicate balance of powers in our federal union since my subcommittees hearings appellate court problems have actually worsened congress has had a hand in this in moving to resolve court congestioni we have substantially broadened the base of the judicial pyramid perhaps because problems are easier to identify at the trial level perhaps because they are more amenable to legislation solution congress acted several times during the 95th and 96th congresses to confront problems at the trial level of the federal judiciary the unitedstates magistrates system was reformed a comprehensive bankruptcy act was passed and an omnibus judgeship bill was enacted these legislative initiativesconsidered collectivelydramatically broadened the ground floor of the judicial pyramid the net result has been dramatic statistical increases in the number of appeals being taken from the district courts to the circuit courts and ulti~iately to the supreme court with the exception of the creation of a handful of circuit judges circuit council reform and the split of the fifth circuit nothing has been legislatively enacted that would imnprove the functioning of the federal appellate system it is noteworthy in this regard that the modest appellate improvements mentioned above have assisted the courts of appeals while actually placing more burdens on the supreme court in short the workload of the supreme courtwhich in 1972 as being at the satuation pointis now assuming even more dangerous proportions as a consequence immediate remedial measures are called for these measures should not dramatcally alter the nature of the high court rather they should rely on its essential role in the american judicial system several things can be done first diversity of citizenship jurisdiction ought to be abolished there is a high number of appeals in these cases and therefore the elimination of diversity would actually improve the functioning of all elementstrial and appellatein the federal court system i already have introduced legislation see h r 2404 97th congress 1st session 1981 to accomplish this end similarly the mandatory jurisdiction of the supreme court should be eliminated we rely on the supreme court to resolve cases on the merits we certainly can rely on the court to determine which cases it can hear for my legislation to accomplish this end see h r 2408 97th congress 1st session 1081 last as explained above we should create an intercircuit tribunalcomposed of sitting circuit judges to assist the supreme court in satisfying its enormous responsibilities by deciding matters assigned to it by the supreme court the tribunal would be of enormous assistance to the high court especially in the area of resolving circuit conflicts and insuring national uniformity of the laws i believe that the ultimate beneficiaries would be all the people in this country i encourage my colleagues to take a hard look at this legislation many of the members of the house and judiciary committees have informally considered this idea at the last of our williamsburg meetings their initial support has encouraged me to work on this legislative proposal i already have shared a draft with chief justice warren burger and prof leo levin director of the federal judicial center as individuals they have expressed support for this modest proposal have encouraged its introduction and have asked for its careful consideration by all interested members of congress in closing i urge your support for this bill the text of the bill follows h r 4762 a bill

legislation entitled the vietnamera veterans health care and benefits act of 1981 which i feel will go far to address the current needs of americas vietnam veterans the first part of this bill will address the most perplexing issue facing vietnam veterans since their return from the war over 10 years ago and that is the question of agent orange i have already introduced legislation to compensate vietnam veterans who may be suffering from conditions due to exposure to that deadly herbicide i will continue to push for passage of this legislation but in the meantime i feel that there is an intermediate step that everyone agrees can and should be taken this intermediate step would require that a veteran who feels his condition is a result of exposure to herbicides and who is examined by a va physician and determined to be in need of medical assistance will be provided with the necessary hospitalization or outpatient treatment this will at least assist veterans and their families in defraying the expensive medical costs that areassociated with chronic illnesses cancer et cetera in the meantime the va air force and center for disease control epidemiology studies will hopefully be able to provide us with more definitive evidence of the likelihood that service in vietnam or exposure to herbicides can cause chronic health effects if an association is proven compensation can and will then be paid second my bill will address the recommendations made by the white house interagency work group on phenoxy herbicides to the va regarding their proposed epidemiology study these recommendations were to expand the scope of the study to include the possible effects of factors other than herbicides namely medications dapzone chemicals penta chlorophenol or any other products that may have health implications on veterans who served in southeast asia third this legislation will reauthorize the vietnam veteran outreach centers which in their initial year of operation counseled over 50 000 vietnam veterans and members of their families this program has been tremendously successful and i am encouraged that both the house and senate veterans affairs committees as well as the senate budget committee have included funds for the continuation of the prograni the vet center in sioux falls s dak has counseled over 600 persons many of whom i have spoken with they have been virtually unanimous in their praise for the program and desire for its continuation fully 48 percent of the vietnam veterans visiting these centers have stated that a major impediment to their successful rehabilitation is their inability to find a job as we are all aware most previous government efforts ceta hire i and ii et cetera aimed at assisting vietham veterans in getting a job have been a dismal failure one of the few exceptions to this unfortunate pattern has been the va administered ojt program where 74 8 percent of those enrolled have completed the program and 95 percent have gone on to use their training for actual employment purposes thus the final portion of my legislation will give vietnam veterans identified through the vet centers or other va offices an opportunity to train under the ojt program regardless of whether they have been delimited or not i feel that this last effort should be made to reach out and assist those vietnam veterans who desire to become gainfully employed i have introduced this particular section of the omnibus bill earlier as h r 2391 finally i feel that passage of this omnibus legislation will be a substantive indication to vietnam veterans that every effort is being made to assist them in completing their readjustment from the war and that this nation is behind those who have fought in the past just as it is now

dispute over steel imports with the europeans through bilateral agreements which would not protect the interests of the american steel industry according to the reports much pressure was being exerted by the european economic community eec to reach a settlement that would prove unfavorable to our domestic producers consequently the executive committee met in an emergency meeting on thursday morning july 21 1982 and agreed unanimously to inform secretary of commerce malcolm baldrige of opposition to the european offer that same night secretary baldrige rejected the european offer to limit steel exports to 90 percent of the 1981 levels i would like to submit here for the record the official press release of the commerce department on this decision the unitedstates department of commerce could not accept a lastminute proposal by the european communities ec to suspend 12 steel countervailing duty cvd investigalions involving belgium france italy and the united kingdom because the legal requirement of removing the apparent injurious effects caused to the unitedstates industry by subsidized steel imports was not met the proposals were formally presented to commerce secretary malcolm baldrige at 5 30 thursday by the ambassadors of the four countries accompanied by representatives of the ec the contents of the proposals had been received that morning the ec requested that the commerce department suspend the investigation on the basis of quantitative restraint agreements as permitted in unitedstates law under that provision the deadline for reaching an agreement is midnight july 24 in announcing his decision baldrige said we welcome any attempt by the community to settle the unfair steel trade cases between the unitedstates and the ec but unfortunately these proposals are not legally acceptable unitedstates law requires that any quantitative restraint suspension agreement must eliminate the injurious effect of subsidized exports of the subject merchandise to the united states since the steel imports from the ec that caused the injury increased almost 30 percent from 1980 to 1981 the 10 percent reduction offered today from the higher 1981 levels was simply not sufficient to remove injury as required baldrige stated that if acceptable suspension agreements could have been concluded on these products the steel trade tension between the ec and the unitedstates would still not have been eliminated he noted that 19 antidumping ad cases on the same products and 13 other ad and cvd cases are still pending baldrige felt that an overall settlement leading to withdrawal of all cases was the best way to relieve the current trade tension and repeated his willingness to continue discussions with the ec to find an equitable basis to deal with the problem in its entirety as well as the proposed suspension agreements the ec required that the unitedstates accept all of the 12 proposed agreements or none in its decision the doc compared the ecs suggested restraint level to the levels at which the unitedstates international trade commission made preliminary determinations of injury in 1980 and 1982 most of the proposed restraint levels were above the levels found to be injurious by the itc doc also considered the current state of the unitedstates industry now running at less than 45 percent utilization and the level of subsidies found in the june 10 preliminary determinations which in one case amounts to 40 percent subsequent to that decision the secretary made a counterproposal to the eec that provided about a 20percent cut in steel imports unfortunately the europeans turned that proposal down in the meantime in accordance to the relevant trade laws future negotiations on these cases will require the commerce department to seek the approval of the domestic steel industry before reaching a settlement now i have been advised that the secretary will pursue additional discussions along these lines this week in brussels it would seem to be in the interests of the european community to 11 4692 co participate in these negotiations otherwise they will risk final determinations and penalties i urge the secretary to do everything in his power to settle these cases as soon as possible in order to get our steelworkers back on the job a mr bevill the war being waged against the american steel industry by foreign steel producers has taken yet another twist news reports indicate that several of the european governments which have been accused of subsidizing their steel mills and permitting them to dump their steel in this country

indicate that the europeans have used the russian gas pipeline deal and other diplomatic issues in an attempt to exert a form of international blackmail against our government they want to force a negotiated settlement without the consent of the injured american steelmakers which brought the complaints if they are successful our domestic steel firms would suffer even further losses of jobs sales and would have to have longer delays in their efforts to modernize their plants further the european nations pressuring for favorable settlements want a guarantee that there will be no future

steel employment in america stands at a depressing 49year low if current trends continue our steel producers can expect to lose 2 billion during this decade and another 100 000 american steelworkers will be without jobs as a member of the executive committee of the steel caucus i want to express in the strongest terms possible my sincere belief that our government must not turn its back on our own steelmakers who have lived within the law the cases they have filed are a test of the law and i believe americans want to see that law enforced the world is watching this important trade issue and

anxietya fear of the consequences of a nuclear holocaust certainly we in this chamber share a deep desire to prevent the death and destruction that would result from the use of any nuclear weapons what we are debating today and what is of the utmost concern to the american people is the urgent need to find a way to prevent a nuclear war the house foreign affairs committee resolution h j res 521 the zablocki resolution which calls for a nuclear freeze does not in and of itself reduce the threat of nuclear war more critical in meeting this objective are reductions in nuclear arms race and to reduce the risk of a nuclear war house joint resolution 521 in imposing a freeze does not guarantee such arms reductions and does not provide for verifying such a freeze rather passage of this resolution by the congress would signal to the soviets that we are willing to accept something less than the arms reductions which are so vitala freeze at a dangerous level of nuclear imbalance with the number of weapons far too great already and a return to the flawed salt ii agreement while many argue that the united states already has sufficient effective nuclear weapons our defense experts contend that air weapons are not as effective as landbased ballistic weapons and that the soviets landbased missiles far outnumber those of the united states the proposed nuclear freeze would lock in the current soviet advantages cutting off our initiatives to correct those imbalances and to achieve a more stable deterrent in the future moreover our negotiators are of the firm belief that such a freeze would eliminate the incentive for the soviets to further engage in serious arms control negotiations another major problem with house joint resolution 521 is verification a meaningful nuclear freeze cannot merely be announced it has to be negotiated such a negotiation would be the most complex in arms control history the united states and the soviet union would first have to clearly define the meaning of a freeze for every single existing weapons system ahd agree on procedures for checking on every phase of weapons development and deployment contrary to the arguments of its supporters a nuclear freeze is not a shortcut to arms control we cannot verify a freeze by any national technical means we cannot see inside factories and warehouses where weapons are produced if we agreed to a freeze then we would have to place our trust in the soviet unions honoring such an agreement but the soviets have a poor track record of honoring international agreements in fact they have abrogated over 90 percent of the treaties to which they have been signatories the soviets have amply demonstrated their adventurismtheir bent on rushing in wherever and whenever they sense the slightest opportunity for geopolitical profit if there is a serious question of trusting the soviets then we must be prepared to verify the soviet arms activities we can and should do better than a freeze we should move expeditiously and effectively toward nuclear arms reductions and we should concentrate our energies and negotiations on that objective president reagan has committed the administration to fully pursue the strategic arms reduction talks start which are now underway in addition the presidents decision to abide by the salt ii treaty provisions voluntarily on a mutual basis is a clear demonstration of the administrations desire to seriously pursue these efforts these and other actions constitute a concrete first step toward reducing the nuclear arsenals of both nations we need to demonstrate at this time that the american people and the congress of the united states are united behind the presidents start proposal failure to endorse start would seriously undercut the american negotiating position reducing our chances for arms control the presidents credibility and the credibility of our nation is at stake the broomfieldcarneystratton resolution will strengthen the hand of the president and our representative in these allimportant and highly sensitive arms reduction negotiations the broomfield resolution makes it clear that we are united behind the president in seeking substantial reductions which will lead to equal and verifiable levels in the arsenals of both the soviet union and the united states and to a reduction in the risk of war by accident or miscalculation by adopting the broomfield resolution we are not opposing an eventual freeze and we are not fostering a nuclear war on the contrary we are determined to prevent a nuclear war to prevent nuclear blackmail and to bring about a reduction of nu clear weaponry most of us in this chamber seek the same objectives we want to find the most effective way to prevent a nuclear war where we differ is in determining how best to achieve that objectiveby a mutual freeze at present levels as proposed in the zablocki resolution or by a negotiated reduction to equal levels then a freeze followed by further negotiated nuclear disarmament as proposed in the broomfieldcarneystratton resolution the united states cannot accept freezing an imbalanced situation that jeopardizes our national security we must

house joint resolution 372 the human life federalism amendment the language is identical to that of the amendment by senator hatch sj res 110 the effect of this amiendment should be clear first it declares that a right to abortion is not secured by the constitution thus reversing the holding in roe against wade that the right to privacy includes the mothers right to kill her unborn child it would remove jurisdiction over abortion from the judicial branch of government and place it again under the legislative branch where it was until the supreme court in 1973 usurped that power this amendment in effect merely asks the people whether they want a voice through their elected represent atives in setting public policy with regard to abortion or whether they would leave it entirely in the hands of judges since this amendment neither restricts abortion nor declares the unborn to be persons there can be no debate over exceptions nor any chiallenge to the question of personhooid by abortion advocates with claims that women having abortions would be prosecuted for murder and those miscarrying would be liable to charges of manslaughter last this amendment contains no restrictions on the use of any type of contraceptive drug or device because this amendment does not raise the question personhood it does not create a legal absolutism that could so easily bc challenged by its opponents who would claim that passage of this amendment would cause every woman having an abortion to be prosecuted for murder and those miscarrying liable to charges of manslaughter because it does not declare that either human beings or persons exist from the moment of fertilization it could not be attacked for outlawing the pill or the iud the simplicity of this amendment is its strength it merely gives congress the power to set a national standard to protect life which individual states can exceed but not fall below for too long the people of this country have been frustrated in their efforts to petition their government for a redress of grievances in this matter the courts have consistently struck down most legislatlve fforts to limit or even regulate abortion spousal and parental consent requirements are virtually nonexistent and in most instances minor daughters can obtain abortions even without parental knowledge what we have in this country today is nothing less than runaway wideopen abortionondexnand there are no real restrictions oni the socalled right to abortion that was created in the supreme courts 1973 decision many people erroneously believe that abortions are freely available in the first trimester subject to medical determination in the seicond and banned in the third when the fetus is viable this is simply not true a lot of people may think it is that way be cause they expected it to be that way or perhaps because subconsciously they wanted it to be that way but the facb is that abortions are allowed even into the third trimester of a pregnancy in its 1973 roe against wade decision the court said that in the first trimester of a pregnancy the abortion decision was solely a matter for the pregnant woman and her doctor that in the second trimester the state may regulate the abortion procedure but only for reasons of the health of the mother and that in the third trimester the state may regulate and even proscribe abortion except where it is medically necessary for the life or health of the mother in other words any doctor may perform an abortion at any time during the entire 9 months of pregnancy as long as hie feels it is medically necessary and as long as he does not kill or harm the woman in the process a state may not prohibit any abortion deemed medically necessary i doubt we could find many doctorswilling to perform an abortion who would also be willing to say that it was not medically necessary here are the courts own words on the subject a for the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant womans attending physician b for the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester the state in promoting its interest in the health of the mother may ilt chooses regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health c for the stage subsequent to viability the state in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may if it chooses regulate and even proscribe abortion except where it is necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother the keyword here is health which has been broadly interpreted to include all factorsphysical emotional psychological and even the womans agerelevant to her wellbeing both congress and state legislatures are virtually powerless to limit this specially created right in any way spousal and parental consent laws have been struck down by the courts the father of an unborn child cannot use legal means to protect its life even the husband of a woman who wishes to abort has no legal recourse to save the life of his own child the parents of minor daughters wishing to abort have no legal voice to prevent the killing of their grandchildren and in most instances they do not even have to be informed of their daughters intention to have an abortion the practice of abortion has gone well beyond what most people thought it would be when the court handed down its 1973 decision the hard cases that were so thoroughly publicized in the early 1970s were seen as the justification for allowing this practice but today these constitute less than 5 percent of the i1v million abortions in this country each year part of the reason for the rapid and expansivf growth of the antiabortion sentiment has been the frustration of the people who as americans believe they should have some voice in the public policy their government sets and who have been i effect excluded from representation in this area by the courts which have overruled or disallowed antiabortion measures at every turn even abortionfunding restrictions which certainly are supported by a majority of americans be they prolife advocates or just plain taxpayers have been challenged and tied up by the courts for years it is obvious that the supreme court 1973 decision legalizing abortion has not exactly enjoyed overwhelming popular support many americans are firmly opposed to it and many others though they may be willing to tolerate the current status of abortion feel that the practice has gone too far when the supreme court made its 1973 decision legalizing abortion it did not solve a problem it created one it legalized the taking of human life before that decision most people really had not given the matter of abortion much thought a few states had permissive abortion laws reports about some hard cases such as the thalidomide babies appeared in the media with almost predictable frequency the shock value of these reports did much to prepare a generally sympathetic reaction in the public mind a predisposition to accept abortion especially in those cases that might cause a lifetime of suffering and anguish there were those rare but wellpublicized pregnancies resulting from rape or incest as well as the everpresent children being born to the poor many of these and other pregnancies came to be called unwanted and some people could see some justification for some abortions and when the court announced a womans right to have an abortion they readily accepted that ruling as the law of the land the few people who did object found it difficult to challenge these justifications without appearing hardhearted and insensitive to the hard cases that had been dramatized so often and so effectively in the years preceding the courts decision the standard comment was i dont approve of aborti on myself but i can not deny a woman the right to have one if she chooses thus the right to have an abortion sanctioned by the court and promoted by a strong abortion lobby was accepted as part of the conventional wisdom but that was a decade ago and times change today the fallacy of that standard comment could readily be seen by substituting the word slavery to get i1 do not approve of slavery myself but i can not deny a slaveholders right to own slaves if he chooses people now have begun to realize that the unborn child is not a part of the mothers body it is a distinct arid individual human life people now realize that the right to choose does have limitations especially when one chooses to kill another human being they have begun to see that what started out as a few hard cases has expanded into a massive anid virtually indiscriminate elimination of more than 11 million unborn human lives a year for reasons much less compelling than a threat to the mothers life or that rare rape or fetal handicap case there has been a veritable parade of women into abortion centerswomen who wanted abortions for economic reasons for social reasons for reasons of convenience comfort and careers and even women who wanted unwanted pregnancies just to demonstrate that they were fertile according to an article entitled abortion chic in the village voice hardly an antiabortion periodical earlier this year feb 10 19831 p 32 many women are replacing having children with having abortions not only in the literal sense but also as a major rite of passage the author leslie savan wrote it provides a reallife experience and seemi to increase our participation in the great tlines of life and death 0 torn between femininity and feminism getting pregnant proves we are feminine while getting an abortion proves we are feminist today people are beginning to see what they did not see when they first accepted what they thought was a little bit of justifiable abortion they had not realized that in the wake of the courts decision there would be a booming business of fullscale wideopen abortionondemand they had not realized that this ruling was a violation of a right that was inviolable and an alienation of a right that was unalienablethe right to life they had not realizedt that once the barrier of protection for this right was broken for one segment of humanity the unborn other members of the human family would be in danger most importantly they had not realized that the precedent established by this deecksion would be used again and again to expand the application of a nowprevailing antilife mentalitya nowaccepted utilitarian ethic that says that only the useful or wanted are acceptable in our society columnist joan beck commented recently chicago tribune may 22 1981 that8ince the laws of this country permit normal healthy babies to be killed actively 4 or 5 months before birth many people are now finding it increasingly easy to tolerate passive euthanasia of severely handicapped infants immediately after birth to make it easier a few physicians refer to a defective newborn as a fetus ex utero 1 apparently calling it by another name would make it seem less human the fact is they are allowing babies to die she was writing in reference to the recent case in danville ill in which severely deformed siamese twins had allegedly been left to die she went on to comment that infanticide occurs in many hospitals where the death of newborns with severe birth defects is often tacitly encouraged and quoted john a robertson university of wisconsin law school professor as having said passive euthanasia of defective newborns is a pervasive and widespread practice in pediatric nurseries hospitals and intensive care units across america europe and elsewhere in his famous infanticidethe silent domino speech a few years ago dr c everett koop spoke of the quiet practice of infanticide and warned that it would become more widespread and accepted because it follows logically as the next step in the spread of the antilife mentality that was let loose when the abortion barrier was broken by the court in in recent months there have been efforts to delete amendments restricting abortion funding from appropriations bills the reason given for this is that authorizing committee chairmen are no longer refusing to deal directly with the abortion issue through substantive legislation and that therefore abortionfunding prohibitions are no longer appropriate nor necessary as riders on appropriations bills this matter it is said would be more appropriately addressed by legislation designed to deal specifically with that subject there is of course a difference between restrictions on abortion funding and restrictions on the practice of abortion itself funding limitations can be and have been enacted through amendments on appropriations bills i would hope that those in effect will remain and that those that are still needed will soon be passed so that taxpayer money is no longer used without limitations to finance abortions under any federal program do we continue year after year with the distasteful experience of debating and redebating this issue in the context of appropriation bills or do we as so many of our colleagues have recommended deal squarely with it here and now thus eliminating the need for annual battles during the appropriations process now is the time to remove the abortion issue from the court monopoly and to give it to the people through their elected representatives in congress and in the states to decide we can no longer allow access to the processes of representative democracy to be closed to those who rightfully object to the practice of abortion when this amendment is passed in congress and is issued to the states for ratification it ii then that

budget substitute that is being brought to the floor for consideration i regret that this is so because i am acutely aware of the fact that the financial markets in this country are waiting anxiously to see if the congress will find the discipline and the willpower to control federal spending and deficits the fate of investment decisions which are critical to the economic recovery of our private sector and the nation hinges on what we do two weeks ago during the first round of budget resolution votes i voted for two budgets the aspin coalition substitute and the unamended house budget committee bill the coalition budget was my first choice it was the handiwork primarily of five moderate democrats and five moderate republicans including myself known as the gang of ten for several weeks we met in an effort to find the common denominators which could attract members of both parties and which could leave behind the partisan posturing which had character ized negotiations to that point of the three major budget blueprints before the house at that time it had the lowest fiscal year 1983 deficit under 100 billion by our estimates and the largest 3year deficit reduction figure when the coalition budget was defeated in a second effort to see a resolution adopted i voted for the house budget committee bill in unamended forra even though i was far from pleased with it what happened in the final analysis is history after debating 8 budgets and considering some 67 amendments the house voted everything down it is ironic to me that after this debacle no real attempt was made to find a middle ground at the request of the steering committee for the group of moderate republicans known as the gypsy moths i participated in the negotiations on the new republican substitute latta ii i approached these sessions in good faith my goal was to get the republican leadership to agree to funding restorations in enough key program areas to insure moderate republican support for the final product and adoption of that plan by the full house other participants in the bargaining meetings were representatives of the reagan administration the boll weevils or southern democrats and the yellow jackets or conservative republicans i made clear that i could not accept some of the program cuts that had been included in latta i and many of the new proposals for cuts over and above latta i that were on the table for discussion i recommended that the revision draft be modified so that an additional 3 billion in defense savings be achieved and an additional 2 2 billion in revenues be raised bringing the revenue total more in line with the senate budget revenue figure with the total 5 2 billion freed up in this manner i suggested the following redistribution scheme 737 million to function 500 to bring education spending into line with the simon amendment to latta i 1 1 billion to function 270 to protect the energy programs important to the northeast 2 5 billion to function 550 to guard against undue benefit reductions for medicare recipients 700 million to function 600 for the food stamp and wic programs and 127 million to function 600 for unemployment compensation i felt certain that this reordering of priorities within the general latta budget framework would produce a plan acceptable to the gypsy moths and to the house as a whole unfortunately instead of moving toward the middle of the political spectrum over my protests the negotiators move further to the right although 1 7 billion of the latta i medicare cut was restored largely in view of the overwhelming votes on the oakar amendments and although most of the necessary unemployment compensation funds were restored my other recommendations were ignored and deeper cuts were made in new areas for example disregarding the will of the house as expressed on the simon amendments to latta i jones i and aspin the negotiators not only failed to add back any education funding to the latta i levels they decided to cut an additional 400 million 304 million of this extra reduction is attributable to technical reestimates which have yet to be specified or explained at the same time this was occurring the democrats in their revised budget were moving further to the left they come to us now with an unacceptably high deficit the net result is that the objectionable features of both original proposals have been worsened rather than improved upon returning to the latta ii blueprint it is interesting to note that this budget poses a serious threat to president reagans new federalism proposal which is presently under negotiation between the states and the administration i say this after having spoken with richard snelling governor of vermont and chairman of the national governors association and a party to these negotiations as members will recall the president in his state of the union address in january suggested that the federal government take over the state share of medicaid payments for the poor while the states take over the federal share of the aid to families with dependent children afdc program plus the food stamp program currently completely federally run after considerable criticism of this idea by the states the administration modified it so that uncle sam would continue to run food stamps now under a national medicaid program certain individuals presently eligible for assistance under liberal state plans such as the vermont system would no longer be eligible we are therefore confronted with the likelihood that with a national program states like vermont would have to pull in the slack with some sort of supplemental medical benefits program latta ii would exacerbate this situation by putting into effect a real reduction in medicald in fiscal year 1982 the program level is 17 82 billion in outlays under latta ii it would be 17 67 billion more slack to pull in the same problem would exist for the food stamp afdc portion of the new federalism latta ii would fund the food stamp program at 10 5 billion in fiscal year 1983excluding the puerto rican part of the program the 1982 level is 10 6 billion reduced food stamp benefits next year under new federalism would mean additional state expenditures for their afdc programs we all know that a good number of states have been using the food stamp program to subsidize their shares of the afdc program for years by setting low afdc benefit levels with the latta ii food stamp cut we could see the roles reversed here the states that would be hardest hit would be those who had the most liberal eligibility criteria particularly in a state like vermont which already has a very high tax effort we will be hard pressed to generate the necessary new revenues we rank near the bottom in terms of per capital personal income and out state and local taxes as a percent of adjusted personal income have been as high as 12 31 percent let me turn to some other areas of the budget where i feel that latta ii has a serious funding shortfall all told latta i reduced funding for the core entitlement programs for the poor by roughly 8 billion over 3 years latta ii slashes them by nearly 18 billion for the food stamp program latta ii cuts much more than the reductions contained in legislation introduced earlier this year by senator dole in introducing his bill senator dole pointed out that his 1983 reduction of 750 million was as far as congress could go without causing serious harm to the needy the latta ii 1983 food stamp cut is 1 3 billion for subsidized housing latta ii provides only 7 4 billion in outlays next year and actually has a negative 5 billion in budget authority representing a 22 6 billion cut from the jones budget i think the transportation function is also seriously underfounded with fiscal year 1983 outlays of only 20 billion mr latta proposes to cut back on interstate transfers which will have serious implications for vermont which has used interstate money to fund important primary and secondary projects latta ii also provides a low funding level for amtrak which could jeopardize the montrealer two additional points the latta defense budget is far too high latta ii cuts defense a mere 300 million more than latta i this token gesture is not sufficient the aspin coalition budget provided a 5 percent real increase for defense in 1983 over 1982 and this level of funding was more than adequate latta ii provides a 7 percent real increase i want to point out that our defense adequacy will be determined by readiness not by some dollars and cents relation to defense spending by soviet bloc countries the pentagon has yet to come up here to the hill and present us with a cogent comprehensive plan of where it thinks threats to our national security around the world will be in years to come and what combination of weapons systems will be needed to meet those threats we will not insure security simply by throwing money at the pentagon the latta ii defense figures will be inflationary will create industrial bottlenecks and will hamper the productivity of our private sector finally although the deficit figure for fiscal year 1983 under the latta plan is somewhat appealing it is also beguiling i think there has been some legerdemain used in arriving at the 99 3 billion figure and i think we will see that number grow in actuality to well over 100 billion if we adopt this plan while this country urgently needs a budget from the house of representatives it does not need nor will it be well served by the latta ii budget we need a plan that balances the need for a strong defense with our legitimate social needs we need a plan which balances the need to reduce spending and taxes and keep the deficit down with our duty to honor commitments

is typical in the current fashion of television broadcasting this supposedly unbiased view of the career of director hoover which spanned over five decades was a collection of halftruths and oftrepeated criticisms which have been standard fare for those opposed to him and the bureau this documentary represents what is becoming the genre of broadcast investigative journalism the courtroom technique if you will of interrorgating one witness then editing his or her comments and sandwiching them between other hostile comments out of context the viewers are never treated to the full facts nor are they given the full answer it is in fact the camera or the editor acting as the prosecutor and the judge the jury we the viewers are not given the chance to see all evidence we only see what the interviewer wishes us to see that style is fine for feature length movies or a cartoon but not for a documentary about our federal law enforcement agency and its late director the public deserves better the charges against mr hoover as leveled by the american broadcasting co have been heard over and over again and have been leveled by critics of the federal bureau of investigation and mr hoover in other forums previous to that thursday evening these accusations typically range from bureau ineffectiveness the late director being a jespotic tyrant to charges of civil rights violations and political blackmail i think that it is important not only for the sake of the late director but for the outstanding service that the federal bureau of investigation has given this country to set the record straight the federal bureau of investigation was established in 1908 as the investigative arm of the unitedstates department of justice it was called then simply the bureau of investigation at the time it had the responsibility for investigating violation of certain federal laws j edgar hoover was made the assistant director of the bureau of investigation in 1921 at that time the bureau had the reputation of a place of corruption and political intrigue in one of his first directions as assistant director mr hoover organized a handpicked team of trustworthy agents to investigate terrorism in the deep south which was being perpetrated by a renascent ku klux klan on the basis of the investigation of one particularly brutal murder the bureau was able to turn away many prominent supporters of the klan in addition on the basis of a continuing bureau investigation imperial kleagel edward y clarke was indicted on white slavery charges and pleaded guilty at the same time under hoovers orders th i bureau uncovered the practice of selilng black prisoners to local farmers a subseqtent conviction stopped that practice the scandals that rocked the harding administration fully revealed the problems within the bureau of investigation a new attorney general harlan fiske stone had the choice of reforming or dismantling the federal investigative unit judge stone as he later became justice of the supreme court realized the need to have an active and efficient investigative unit at the federal level and knew that its choice of leader was critical in order to rid the bureau of its poor reputation he chose john edgar hoover vho accepted only after he was assured that the bureau would be free from political pressure subject only to the attorney general and that hiring and personnel decisions would be made only on the basis of merit judge stone and loover were determined to create an inestigative bureau that would be the model of integrity and more importantly an efficient uncorruptible arm of justice and the justice department and director hoover achieved that end and it was his promise tc do just that before he would accept the responsibility of being director the bureau instituted the policy of hiring only on merit got rid of all of the political appointees and began the task of becoming the model federal investigative unit in the space of 5 years the bureau had gone from what one writer of the time called a national disgrace to in the words of justice stone a bureau that the government can now take pride in instead of feeling obliged to apologize for it as the nation entered the depression the rate of crime was reaching epidemic proportions during the prohibition era gangsterism flourished as a result of this 7 imate and cases such as the lindburgh kidnapping case the bureaus duties were expanded by such laws as the kidnapping and extortion statutes the federal bank robbery act the national stolen property act and the antiracketeering act and agent were given authority to carry firearms and make arrests which they had not previously had today that expansion has grown to the point that the bureau is esponsible for investigations dealing with violations of over 170 federal statutes including the civil rights act which were imposed by thi congress on the bureau it was during this period that the bureau became prominent and the appellation of gman became popular in the folklore of this period and previously many critics point to this as an example of the use of publicity for the bureau for results that did not warrant such publicity it is important to note that such an appellation and the fear aspect that is implicit in that nickname reflected the great strides that the bureau had made in evolving from a national disgrace to an investigative unit that was given more and more reponsibility as it proved itself the federal bureau of irvestigation succeeded in its war against gangsterism and managed to stop such notorious criminals as george machine gun kelly alvin karpis john dillinger and the barker gang when war broke out in europe and it was feared that it would spread to the united states the federal bureau of investigation assumed another role that of counterintelligence and intercepting potential saboteurs and espionage agents on december 7 when news of the bombing of pearl harbor reached the united states fbi agents were ready and within 24 hours over 1 700 aliens were in custody to the credit of the dedication and hard work of the bureau in cooperation with other intelligence networks not one single enemydirected act of sabotage was committed in the united states during world war ii after the war the bureau again hae its responsibility enlarged with the passage of the atomic energy act the bureau was given the responsibility of safeguarding the secrets of the united states through personnel security checks and surveillance of seditious organizations in the early sixties and as the civil rights movement gained ground the bureau was in the forefront again of investigation of violence related to that movement in the development of the bureau one of the most efficient and respected investigative units in the world mr hoover introduced several concepts unknown in law enforcement he established the identification division in 1924 providing a new concept in identification senator carl hayden of my own state of arizona was instrumental in this effort which entailed an indexed fingerprint chart to help trace criminals he established the fbi laboratory in 1932 to use the benefits of modem science to aid law enforcement in 1935 the fbi national academy was established and remains one of the finest law enforcement education institutions in the world its purpose to train worthy law enforcement officers in administration and police work as the bureau has grown as additional responsibilities were thrown at it it attracted criticisms when director hoover received assurance that the bureau would be free of political influence he kept it that way he opposed any concept of a national police organization as has been charged in the program during the long sessions of the investigation chaired by senator mccarthy it was director hoover that come out against open publication of fbi security files to protect the innocent from any whispering campaign during the early and middle sixties the bureau and the director were charged with racism i find it odd that the charge was leveled because it was the fbi alone that responded to the violence in the early sixties when local law enforcement agenices could not or in some case would not investigate the murders and beating that took place the documentary aired by abc on director hoover tries to smear the bureau and the director with implied charges of fascism blackmail and generally attempting to paint a hardworking dedicated agency as a closed tyrannical society bent on destroying the constitutional right it was charged with protecting in relating the bureaus involvement with dr martin luther king abc implies that the director out of some racist or puritanical hate for dr king put him under surveillance and tried to prevent him from leading the civil rights movement abc patently ignores the fact that u hile wiretaps were authorized on dr king they were authorized by attorney general robert kennedy because of dr kings association with known communists and the fear that the communists would use the civil rights movement to foment other than peaceful change in american society the telecast opens with the line that j edgar hoover imposed his personal vision on congress presidents and on millions of americans the implied notion is that mr hoover used the threat of supposedly existent files on anyone who would defy him if indeed mr hoover imposed this vision on anything it was on the bureau he took a discredited agency and developed it into the most effective and respected investigative body in the world the documentary tries to make a case from the success of the bureau in stopping sabotage in world war ii as more a public relations creation than a fact however it still remains a fact that not one single enemydirected act of sabotage took place in the united states during the war the telecast makes several accusations of the kind that are only fit for cheap irresponsible tabloids the entire last third of the show is dedicated to examples of bureau surveillance and the implication is left that they were done in the attempt to gain leverage in the political arena director hoover was careful since the beginning of his tenure to have a reputable agency that worked to get investigation accepted in court not thrown out it is ironic that the method he most despised innuendo implications are used against him after his death the exercise we saw on abc is how to kick a dead horse his was a vision of protection of the nation and law he loved he battled nazism communism and the ku klux klan with equal fervor he introduced comprehensive law enforcement training in america for the first time he raised the level of law enforcement from that of mere night watchman to a respected profession more importantly he taught us respect for the law the best way to sum up director hoover is found in the book authored by ralph de toledano john edgar hoover did not wear golden shoes he was sometimes wrong many times more right but he lkved america he believed in america and he fought for amerlea for most americans that was enough for those who knew him that was a begin ning jume 23 1982 i have a letter in my hands from our former colleague congressman sam devine who is now practicing law here which i would like to insert in the record at this point it is a letter directed to mr leonard goldson chairman of the american broadcasting co in new york and takes on the charge with regard to a point made in the abc network program indicating that mr hoover had been accused of homosexuality it was never proved and it was reported that he was not but why mention it in the first place congressman devine addresses that point the letter follows"], [0.5422334671020508, 0.5422334671020508, 0, "i rise in enthusiastic support of s 1192 and urge my colleagues to accept this carefully drafted measure as a wellthought out and workable solution to the problems that have troubled union station for many years as we are well aware the handling of this national landmark by both the congress and executive branches alike has been the source of much rightful criticism over the years due to this mishandling union station has deteriorated rapidly becoming structurally unsafe and resulting in its closing earlier this year as the ranking member dn the public buildings and grounds subcommittee i have had the opportunity of working closely with our senate counterparts and the administration on this legislation much enthusiasm was shown regarding the new approach we are taking to this issue which will result in correcting many of our past errors and rehabilitating union station with minimal new federal authorizations however should congress fail to act on this measure the situation at union station will only worsen andwill require substantially greater amounts of taxpayers dollars sometime in the future to deal with what will certainly be a more delapidated facility as previously mentioned s 1192 is an innovative approach that will require additional new authorizations of only 275 000 for up to 6 years for the expedited purchase of union station it should be emphasized that by purchasing the station in this manner the government will be relieved of approximately 28 million in outyear lease payments which we now must pay through the year 2001 while others have highlighted the key provisions of this bill i would just like to touch upon and reemphasize a few of these an absolutely essential part of this bill and its proposed solution is the provision authorizing the secretary of dot to work with private commercial developers to enhance the rail terminal facility with minimum federal financing according to testimony in subcommittee there is significant interest in the pri vate sector for pursuing development at union station additionally at the southern terminus of the heavily traveled northeast rail corridor responsibility for union station is more appropriately transferred to the department of transportation and a study of the buildings structural integrity rail passenger handling functions and the potential for private development will be authorized finally the parking garage which is already partially constructed would be completed by the use of 40 million in interstate highway moneys apportioned to the district of columbia this money will not be available after this year thereby requiringus to act in a timely fashion on this measure let me point out that this bill is the work of both senate committees with jurisdiction over union station the reagan administration and both house public works and transportation committee and house energy and commerce committee as a consensus measure these committees have recognized that there may never again be an opportunity like this to finally rectify our unfortunate experience with union station i would urge all members to support this important legislation mr flor o i rise in support of s 1192 the union station redevelopment act of 1981 anyone who is familiar with washingtons union station knows the terrible inconvenience rail passengers in the northeast corridor have to endure the leaking roof and other structural problems of the building not to mention the walk of more than a~ quarter of a mile from the front of the building to the train boarding areas have been wellpublicized and the source of great embarrassment for the congress as well as the executive agencies that have dealt with it the bill before us today is an important first step toward the restoration of this building as the major rail transportation facility it should be although the primary purpose of the bill is the restoration of the building for the provision of rail transportation services a secondary goal of the bill is the commercial development of the station developers state and local officials and the public have become increasingly interested in station development not only for union station but for many of the stations in the northeast corridor for example newarks penn station in my state of new jersey has already begun a 21 million rehabilitation project prudential insurance co will soon begin the construction of a 50 million office building next to the station and another developer plans to begin construction on a second office building sometime next year this and other projects like philadelphias 30th street station have become the focus of major commercial development projects i believe these projects can be successful with proper public support the bill before us provides that support at the same time it puts a cap on funds from existing authorizations that may be used for union station improvements so that funding for other projects will not be jeopardized in addition it provides for amtraks involvement in both the commercial development as well as the structural study to be conducted by the secretary of transportation in this way i feel a solid development plan can be developed and implemented over the last 4 years of the northeast corridor improvement project the federal government has spent more than 1 6 billion in upgrading tracks signaling maintenance facilities bridges and other elements of the 400maile rail corridor between washington d c and boston mass with these improvements and the introduction of new amtrak equipment ridership and revenues on the northeast corridor have continued to grow today the corridor accounts for more than half of amtraks total ridership and more than a third of its annual revenues although the corridors record of use and profitability has been truly impressive performance promises to reach new highs with the completion of the next phase of corridor improvementsrail station development for the 10 million passengers who use amtraks northeast corridor services each year the horrible conditions that exist at most stations are well known physical deterioration and inadequate services have become hardships with which rail passengers have had to contend an important part of assuring that the station revitalization effort is successful is the final resolution of washingtons union station the southern terminus of the notheast corridor as many of my colleagucs know amtrak has been operating its rail passenger services out of a temporary terminal behind union station the terminal is grossly inadequate for current ridership let alone the significant increase expected when the northeast corridor improvement project is finished four million passengers annually now walk more than onequarter of a mile from the front of the union station building to the location of the trains behind the temporary facility by 1990 the department of transportation estimates that 9 million people will use the station each year while this situation is clearly uinacceptable for rail users it was not until february of this year when the roof began to leak uncontrollably and the main terminal was declared structurally unsafe that the public generally recognized the need to deal with the union station problem the legislation we have before us today is a good first step toward dealing with that problem i would like to add at this point that my committees support of this legislation is contingent upon agreement with our senate counterpart over future funding of the northeast corridor improvement project that agreement is based on the assumption that the department of transportation will spend 2 5 billion the full authorization for northeast corridor improvement the northeast corridor improvement project as authorized in public law 96254 envisioned that a part bf the total 2 5 billion project authorization would be spent for rehabilitation and improvements at union station the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 public law 9735 instructs the secretary of transportation to complete project improvements to the extent of the full authorization and therefore the expenditure of 29 million for union station would not jeopardize other critical corridor improvements this is an important point to understand there is no money currently in the department of transportations reduced corridor project for improvement at union station it is therefore not our intent that an exception be made for union station providing that it should be funded while other project improvements which also are not part of the departments reduced scope of work should remain unfunded instead in reaching our agreement on s 119 k we presume the depairtment of transportation will complete as much of the project work as can be accomplished with the expenditure of the full authorization of 2 5 billion furthermore it should be noted that this legislation allows the house and senate commerce committees to veto the use of more than 29 million to implement union station development from northeast corridor and rail or railrelated programs under the jurisdiction of the house and senate commerce this is simply a precautionary provision to insure that money congress approved for other purposes is not spent on union station in this regard i would like to assure my colleagues that my subcommittee will look very skeptically on any union station development plan if the department of transportation has not made satisfactory arrangements for actually completing all elements of the corridor project that can be funded with the full authorization of 2 5 billion furthermore at our committees request s 1192 as reported by the senate committee on environment and public works has been changed to provide that the secretary of transportation shall cooperate with amtrak in conducting the union station commercial development study under any development plan the primary use of the building will be for rail passenger service as a result the success of the union station development efforts from a commercial standpoint depend greatly on the successful development and use of the building as a rail facility amtrak as the only operator of intercity passenger service out of union station must therefore be closely involved in the overall station development plan clearly the temporary facility in the rear of the building is inadequate and amtraks passenger services must be returned to the main terminal building in addition passengers must be given better access to the trains than the onequarter mile hike they currently have to endure at the very minimum passenger access which is equivalent to that which rail users had prior to the relocation of the tracks behind the temporary replacement facility is needed overall i feel the legislation before the house today satisfactorily addresses the union station problem and the concern of the authorizing committees that improvements at union station be undertaken only if other improvements which are part of a budget that provides for the expenditure of the full 2 5 billion authorization are completed in addition to commercial interests who have recently shown great interest in union station development the government of the district of columbia recently has committed up to 40 million to complete the parking garage which is only partially constructed in the station area these commitments along with the sizeable contributions from the northeast corridor improvement project i feel sure will result in the successful revitalization of union station i urge my colleagues to support this legislation"],

date for such an effort for three reasons one is that this is the beginning of business for most purposes for the 97th congress and there is no better time to call to the attention of our new members and to remind our previous ones the nature extent and importance of the issue of our american prisoners and missing in southeast asia the second reason this is an appropriate time is because today just a little while ago 52 americans former hostages in iran rode by this capitol in a motorcade on their way to the white house for a visit with president reagan they are home after 444 days of captivity at the hands of the iranians all america joins in this longawaited reception there is a third reason for mentioning this issue today there is an irony that the hostages should come home to washington d c on this date because it marks the eighth anniversary of the paris accords the agreement which in 1973 ended the unitedstates troops participation in the indochinese hostilities and paved the way for 566 american prisoners to come home from vietnam we all recall operation homecoming when in four groups from february 12 to march 31 1973 those longheld americans walked out onto friendly soil it was a day of deep emotion and pride in the way tl se men returned full of personal spirit and patriotism despite illtreatment and years under the control of the vietnamese i would like us to ask ourselves how would we feel and what would our reactions be if of the 52 americans held in iran only 15 or 20 were returned or even as many as 45 or all but 1 or 2 came back while the remainder stayed behind and then the iranian government would plead ignorance as to their fate or whereabouts well that is roughly a parallel to the situation of our americans who were held in indochina according to defense department statistics on april 2 1973 there remained 2 528 who were unaccounted for in indochina those were men who had been killed in action were prisoners of war or were simply missing in action since april 2 1973 only 73 sets of remains have been returned to us and i prisoner robert garwood as of this time we still consider 2 497 unaccounted for at least 1 100 to 1 200 of those were initially either known or reasonably believed to be alive in enemy custody now 8 years after the paris accords and the joy of operation homecoming there are still almost 2 500 americans whose fate has been unresolved my joy over the return of the 52 is great but it is tempered by the memory of those other missing are they hostages at the time of the paris accords there was talk of 3 2 billion in reconstruction assistance for vietnam there are signs that the government of vietnam has never forgotten this figure nor really accepted our unwillingness to provide such massive assistance it appears to some that american remains at least are being retained by the vietnamese to assure vietnam of american paymentin short as bargaining chips of course this sum was not paid because they blatantly violated the ceasefire agreement nearly a thousand times thus we have a sizable task before us the task is more difficult than it might have been due to the policies of the previous administration from 1977 to 1979 president carter and his advisers all but allowed the issue to be buried after the woodcock mission which obtained several sets of remains and led to the creation of a channel of cooperation between the vietnamese and this country it was announced that the issue had been laid to rest despite the presidents campaign promises that he would not move toward normalization until an accounting was achieved we came close to recognizing the vietnamese government in the summer of 1978 but a series of events intervened the vietnamese callously and heartlessly exported refugees concluded a treaty with the soviet union and then our government suddenly decided to recognize the peoples republic of china i think it was not coincidental following normalization with the prc and the vietnamese invasion of cambodia that the subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs under chairman lester l wolff began to obtain more cooperation from the executive branch in the spring of 1979 the issue of pow mias began to be handled at a higher level in the defense and state departments international security affairs at the defense department assumed responsibility while gen eugene b tighe director of the defense intelligence agency began to devote greatly increased efforts to the pursuit of numerous reports covering hundreds of refugees as to the fate of our missing americans at about the same time chairman wolff appointed me chairman of a bipartisan task force on pow mias which permitted broadened attention to the issue in the congress as a result we have managed to restore some of the faith of the families that was eroded during the first 2 years of the last administration most of the families of our missing americans recognize that we are working hard to get the answers to the question what happened to our men yet we must not flag in our efforts there are still 2 500 men unaccounted for it was not an automatic or easy task to get the sort of attentio this issue deserves from the executive branch ii 209 the subcommittee on asian alfarrs and the task force on pow mias have done a good dealdozens of hearings numerous briefings two trips to hanoi and so on we have as a result of our efforts though established by collection of information what the mathematics and the political logic had already told usthat there are remains of americans at least 400 to 500 sets in vietnamese hands in short intelligence has confirmed our convictions we reach this virtual certainty despite repeated vietnamese claims that they are unable to find remains there have been increasing numbers of reports that live americans have been sighted in indochina we cannot simply ignore these reports and we are not our intelligence community is very hard at work on these because we are mindful that until pfc robert garwood came out we tended to believe vietnamese assurances that there were no ameclans left alive in vietnam my good colleague ben gilman has addressed sonic recent developments in this area and i urge attenlion to his remarks there is one other constructive development i should report for several nionths now there has been an interagency group meeting on this problem members of the state department defense intelligence agency international security affairs of doi joint chiefs of staff and the foreign affairs committee staff regularly meet to exchange updates on progress and to discuss potential policy directions and it is in this last area that i wish to make my final plea we have received cooperation between the go ernment and the families we have even made the govermments of indochina aware that we represent substantial public concern in this conneclion congressmen solarz and pritchard again made clear to hanol that our priority and concern for our missing americans has not diminished but we need to develop a coherent and mutually acceptable policy toward the governments of indochina regarding the pow mia issue in this respect i urge our new president to avoid the mistakes of the recent past and to take the lead in pursuing and conciuding this sad issue working with the congress toward a final accounting for all our americans missing in souttheast asia it is the only fitting way to mark the beginning of the 9th year of the paris accords otherwise we will not have a peace with honor but with

formulation of a very important point of foreign poicy that will both affect the presidents ability to function as the chief executive in foreign policy matters and as commander in chief of the armed forces of the united states so we are assuming a heavy burden as we ponder this resolution and decide how to vote i would ask each of my colleagues to think about his vote to look beyond the technicalities of the resolution to look beyond the technicalities of awacs and the extra equipment for f15 fighter aircraft those technicalities are important but they really are not the fundamental question at stake here today circumstances have placed upon the president of the united states the duty the responsibility the inescapable responsibility to provide leadership for security throughout the middle e~ast it cannot be shifted to anyone else i do not know of anyone who would like to see the united states by itself become the policeman of the middle east who would really relish that assignment for our country that means then that if we are to provide leadership we must have cooperation with other major states in the region we of course will have cooperation from the state of israel but that alone is not enough the president of the united states must have the highest possible level of cooperation with moderate arab states now that we have uncertainty in egypt it argues even more forceably for the president to have cooperation from saudi arabia we can turn down the awacs proposition it is bound to be a setback for the president in dealing with saudi arabia and i willlater recount the manyf instances in which saudi arabia has helped our country in this role of middle east security leadership it has been a vitally important role so i would ask my colleagues to consider the p~roblems the president faces and recognizing that in wrestling with the daytoday uncertainties of middle eastern policy he needs to have a good cooperative relationship with saudi arabia we are all aware of the dangers that exist there is talk now of a possible coup by qaddafi in the sudan and what will be the united states response there is a prospect that we might have to be engaged militarily president reagan has made a comment about internal disturbances in saudi arabia and indicated that our national interests would require us to help bring stability should some sort of insurrection occur jimmy carter not long ago declared that we should be the nation to defend the persian gulf from any adventurism from the soviet union this adds up to an awful burden upon the president do we want the united states standing alone as the policeman of the middle east it just does not make sense we need the cooperation of friendly states such as saudi arabia to defend our interests in order to advance the leadership potential of the president we really owe it to him to cooperate in this reasonable moderate secur ty relationship which saudi arabia has requested to do anything short of that is to undercut the president in this very critical time of need in the wake of the death of president sadat the burden of middle eastern leadership falls even more heavily upon the oval office and we should provide our cooperation in addition i would stress that the sale of awacs to saudi arabia will serve important unitedstates security objectives it will enable saudi arabia to improve greatly the deterrence against attacks on oilfields in the southern persian gulf and to reduce the need for rapid unitedstates reinforcements or for unitedstates forces in the gulf it will provide a greatly enhanced capability for the unitedstates air force and unitedstates navy carrier aircraft to provide saudi arabia with overthehorizon reinforcements in contingencies such as an allout iraqi or iranian attack or a major soviet move into the gulf this will strengthen the unitedstates capability to protect our oil supplies from the gulf it will create a longterm strategic partnership between saudi arabia and the united states that will encou~rage saudi moderation and strengthen the prowestern elements of the saudi government the alternative is to force saudi arabia to take a more radical posture toward the arabisraeli conflict it will make saudi arabia dependent on continued unitedstates technical and arms support and make it almost impossible for saudi military strength to be deployed effectively against israel the alternative is for saudi arabia to obtain arms over which the united states has no control and which may be far more offensive in nature indeed the british government has stated that it is willing to sell the saudis the nimrod an airborne early warning system comparable j the awacs and the french are ready to sell the mirage fighter aircraft should the saudis cancel the f15 sale because of congressional refusal to see the awacs and p15 enhancement equipment moreover saudi arabia has been supportive of united states interests when the iraniraq war reduced the oil exports of those nations to the west saudi arabia increased its oil production so that western economiesincluding our ownwould not be adversely affected saudi arabia has frequently cooperated with the united states in providing economic aid to friendly countries that are strategically important such as tunisia the sudan somalia pakistan and turkey saudi arabia has often served as a moderating influence in arab councils dissuading arab states from undertaking acts contrary to unitedstates interests with the united states saudi arabia has sought to curb soviet influence in the middle east and condemned the soviet invasion of afghanistan while saudi arabia has differed with us on the camp david process it is firmly committed to a peaceful solution to the middle east conflict saudi arabia was instrumental in the achievement of a ceasefire in lebanon this past july and saudi arabia recently issued an eightpoint peace plan which implicitly accepts the right of israel to exist and live in peace it demonstrates the desire of saudi arabia for a peaceful solution it is an important step forward for these reasons i support the sale of awacs to saudi

authorizes 10 million for the unitedstates travel and tourism administration to carry out its responsibilities under the international travel act of 1961 and the national tourism policy act of 1981 last year the committee on energy and commerce reported the first major tourism legislation since 1961 that measure the national tourism policy act of 1981 was then passed overwhelmingly by this house the purpose of the 1981 law was to establish the framework for a more aggressive tourism promotion program in the united states it did that by replacing the old unitedstates travel service with the unitedstates travel and tourism administration this new administration is to develop a yearly marketing plan setting forth detailed marketing objectives and estimates of the funding and personnel necessary to reach the goal of an increased unitedstates share in the world tourism market the problem faced by the ustta this year is the same as that confronting other federal programsan insufficiency of operating funds to carry out its statutory responsibilities while i am sympathetic to the financial plight of the ustta i feel that it must do its share to conserve scarce federal dollars particularly in light of major cutbacks in our environmental and social welfare programs so while i will go on record today supporting h r 6258 i must add that i expect the ustta to come forward at the earliest possible time with responsible and reasonable private sector methods for funding our national tourism objectives private alternate sources of funding is a concept which congressman gary lee and i raised both in subcommittee and full committee tourism reauthorization deliberations this year during these meetings we made it clear that dramatic increases in federal funding of tourism programs is simply inappropriate given the severe cutbacks in other extremely worthy federal programs our committee reports on h r 6258 incorporates congressman lees and my thinking on this issue that report directs the ustta to report its findings on alternate sources of funding to the energy and commerce committee within 6 weeks of transmittal to the congress of the presidents recommended budget for fiscal 1984 hopefully these new sources can be tapped in time to assist with 1984 tourism program funding thank you e"], [3.933906555175781e-06, 0.4999960660934448, 0, "i thank the gentleman for his comments let me say that house joint resolution 391 provides the requested fiscal year 1982 supplemental appropriations to the department of labor of 343 5 million for state grants for unemployment insurance and employment services and 1 9 billion in geieral revenue advances to the unemployment trust fund and these funds are in addition to what we did in december let me also say that the other bill that this rule will make in order deals with the commodity credit corporation and our people who are familiar with the workings of the commodity credit corporation realize that we have had some unusual drawdowns on these funds as a matter of fact the ccc records on unreimbursed losses of 252 6 million from fiscal year 1980 3 5 billion from fiscal year 1981 and 1 5 billion from the first quarter of fiscal year 1982 total 5 3 billion in addition unexpectedly high commodity loan demand and deficiency payments for wheat and barley reduced available borrowing authority to 603 million as of january 26 1982 the ccc anticipates the remaining funds will be depleted in early february by cotton and rice deficiency payments requiring suspension of all further loan and payment operations the ccc fund depletion is due pri marily to current depressed market conditions record 1981 crops and increases in commodity program loan and purchase rates the ccc also provided funds to other agencies for medfly operations and crop inst rance payments another factor is the higher interest rates charged the ccc on its borrowings in fiscal year 1981 rates averaged 15 percent and in 1981 interest payments totaled 1 2 billion so we have seen some unusual situations that have occurred because of the depressed situation not only in the economy generally but because of the market situations throughout the country and record crops there is an urgent need to pass this legislation if we do not want to close down the operation of the ccc by mid february and to deny

compliment the gentleman for calling this special order to discuss the most important issue facing the american people and the congress that issue is the response that we must make to the program the president has laid before the congress and the people on the matter of the economy the members of this house owe it to their constituents to work with president reagan to control inflation and to stimulate the economy of the nation to higher employment and greater productivity these are economic goals that the members and this house of both parties share the commitment to work with the president however does not absolve members of the responsibility to evaluate carefully each budget proposal careful consideration does not mean obstruction the case for a prudent budget cut will be strengthened not weakened by that scrutiny not all budget cuts are of equal merit if they were we could simply assign a target dollar figure and pull budget cuts out of a hat to reach that target before we consider the cuts we should rid ourselves of the notion that all sectors of the economy and all citizens will bear the burden of these cuts equitably we should be honest in recognizing that the reagan administration proposals will heavily affect our poorest citizens and our oldest cities if we accept the reagan proposal we should admit to ourselves and to our se february 24 1981 constituents that the poorest americans will feel the pain of the cuts most we should not mislead our con stituents in arguing that there is equity the american people expect reductions in federal spending i believe congress is likely to approve most of the presidents proposal at the same time i have doubts about the effectiveness of these cuts in the fight against inflation the program does not address four major components of inflation energy health food and housing costs one of the presidents first major acts was inflationarythe complete decontrol of oil prices for the middleincome working people of this country who are the overwhelming majority of the population inflation is the most serious economic problem it erodes paychecks and discourages efforts to save inflation has made us a nation of spendersnot a nation of savers while i am for control of wasteful unnecessary spending both by government and by the private sector i must ask how effective the presidents spending cuts will prove in controlling the root causes of inflation furthermore the presidents tax proposal seems to present an enormous economic risk a general acrosstheboard tax cut is not supply side economics it puts more money in the economy without providing assurances that money will actually be used to increase the productive capability of the economy i have other comments that i would like to make i will not use however more of the gentlemans time i know it is limited i would like to include the text of remarks on this subject that i delivered last week again i compliment the gentleman for his

significantly higher authorization ceiling i would also prefer that the bill not contain some of the restrictions which it would place on the activities of the legal services corporation however i recognize that this bill is a carefully crafted compromise and i urge my colleagues to recognize that it will accomplish the very necessary step of continuing the federal funding of a program to give poor people the basic right and ability to have access to our system of justice we have heard from opponents of the legal services corporation that this program is nothing more than a subsidy to fund socalled liberal causes but i would ask my colleagues to define the term legal causes for us in philadelphia these funds have been used to protect an elderly woman whose signature was forged on a loan application leading to her home being put up for sale at a sheriffs auction they have been used to secure social security payments for a man who was disabled and who had been improperly denied benefits and they have been used to prevent people from being taken advantage of or ignored by those government agencies which are supposed to protect the rights of citizens i do not see how these cases qualify as liberal causes and i further suggest that the federal legal services programs have been the target of some highly unfair and incorrect criticism its critics charge that legal services lawyers have increasingly focused on class actions which attack government organizations and private interests but in fact in 1980 only twotenths of 1 percent of all cases handied by legal services lawyers had more than one plaintiff of these cases only a small portion was actually brought on behalf of a class of persons clearly the overwhelming majority of the cases handled by legal services attorneys involve only one client and involve everyday problems of poor people the cases do not involve controversial social issues rather they invblve matters which might appear to be mundane to some of my colleagues but which in fact are matters of crisis for individual clients most legal service cases involve family law such as adoption custody divorce support parental rights and spouse abuse or income maintenance housing health and consumer problems such as credit debt collection contracts and warranties another thought we have heard expressed in this chamber is that private lawyers could handle the cases if the reagan administration gets its way and the legal services corporations funding is folded into a block grant giving states the option to provide legal services these cases totaled more than 1 5 million last year alone those lawyers who do handle pro bono work would not be able to absorb such a great number of cases if the legal services corporation were to be abolished finally i would urge the president to reject the advice he is receiving that he veto this bill should congress pass it as the philadelphia inquirer states so eloquently in a june 12 1981

in the committee on parliamentary juridical and human rights questions on the subject the development of parliamentary institutions with respect of the constitution and their work in the sphere of

my remarks i raised directly the issue of what constitutes genuine political influence of parliaments in this regard i felt it was important to remind delegates that martial law such as that imposed in poland should clearly be regarded as incompatible with what the ipu stands for and therefore should be strongly criticized while some in the meeting halls may have considered it impolite to criticize the political system of other delegatesparticularly those from the soviet bloc i felt it also appropriate to direct criticism at the restriction on free debate of eastern european countries
