banking matters on which prompt action is vital in effect the committee amendment for convenience incorporates two separate bills ordered reported by the banking corxmittee on november 5 into a single bill containing two titles title i of the bill contains the text of a bill introduced on november 2 as h r 4879 by my colleague from new york mr schumeri dealing with international banking facilities on december 3 1981 pursuant to regulations of the federal reserve board international banking facilities will be permitted in the united states 113fs may be established by unitedstates depository institutions by edge and agreement corporations and by unitedstates branches and agencies of foreign banks the board issued proposed rules last december and adopted the final rule june 18 1981 with an effective date of in brief an ibf may accept deposits from and extend credit to foreign residents or other ibfs all such funds will be exempt from reserve requirements and from interest rate limlitations of regulation q the purpose of ibfs at unitedstates banking offices is to enhance the international competitive position of banking institutions in the united states consistent with this basic purpose it now becomes necessary to review thle february 18 1981 interpretation of fdic to thle effect that ibf deposits are subject to fdic insurance assessments under the federal deposit insurance act the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision regulation and insurance of thle house banking committee heard testimnony that if unitedstates ibfs are required to pay the fdic premium amounting to onetwelfth of 1 percent of their deposits then they will be comnpetitive y disadvantaged this premium is considered especially important because as the testimony indicated many ibfs may operate on very narrow margins title i of h r 4879 would eliminate the insurance requirement for what in essence are deposits of extremely sophisticated international investors seeking the highest possible yields with the december 3 effective date nearing congress has an opportunity to prevent burdensome regulation and at the same time insure competitive equality between unitedstates and foreign banks by actinig in a manner fully consistent with the letter and spirit of theo federal reserve boards action in permitting the establishment of ibifs title i of the bill also includes an amendment adopted at full committee markup extending fdic deposit insurance coverage to branches of insured banks operating in the trust territory of the pacific islands currently fdics authority to insure deposits includes areas in the pacific such as guam and american samoa but under current law fdic cannot offer insurance in the trust territory fslics authority to insure thrift deposits does include the trust territory therefore title i of the bill would expand fdics authority to cover the trust territory title ii of the bill was introduced by myself mr stanton and mr gonzalez and was considered by the committee as h r 4515 this title deals with existing statutory limitations affecting mortgage purchases both by the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association present charter requirements limit the dollar value of loans which are more than 1 year old when sold to 20 percent of the total value of conventional mortgages in fhlmcs or fnmas portfolios this limitation will soon raise serious problems in connection with new programs under which fhlmc and fitma will use their currently unused capacity to purchase or place older mortgages and it is expected as a result provide improved liquidity to mortgage lending institutions this is november 17 1 981 the highly successful swap program of the federal home loan mortgage corporation this program in the short period it has been in effect has been popular indeed inasmuch as it permits the swapping of older lowyielding mortgage loans for mortgage corporation participation certificates pcs these illiquid mortgages responsible in large part for difficulties being encountered by the thrift industry are converted into highly liquid securities ultimately additional funds are freed up for new mortgage funding i have been advised by fhlmc that with its most recent auction fhlmc has virtually reached its 20 percent ceiling for all practical purposes and that absent this legislation now the program must be shut down until such time as purchases of new mortgages in the corporations other programs made it possible to hold another swap auction it is now clear that the value of new loans will be depressed for 1982 and as a consequence it seems unlikely that the swap program can be offered at anywhere near a level commensurate with the need and demand unless congress approves this legislation another provision of title ii would give the same seller service status to fdic and ncua as that fslic with respect to using fhlmc and f nma programs to aid troubled financial institutions and to dispose of loan portfolios acquired in takeovers this flexibility is fully consistent with action taken by the house on october 28 in passing overwhelmingly h r 4603 the socalled regulators bill the provisions now included in this title wf re the subject of hearings by the sub~commiittee on financial institutions on september 22 at which time testimony was received from the home loan bank board the comptroller of the currency dhud fhlmc fhma as well as fromsevery major trade association by appearance before the subcommittee or by written statement all testified in favor of providing increased flexibility for each corporations mortgage purchase operations title ii is a limited piece of legislation which does not address the more fundamental issues affecting both fhlmc and fnma there are more comprehensive proposals circulating involving both fhlmc and fnma which are part of the cominittces comprehensive discussion principles issued by mr stanton and myself on monday november 9 on which the committee will begin hearings in the near future at this point i am inserting in the record the text of two letters from the congressional budget office

provide a firm basis for expanding unitedstates exports as the original house sponsor of export trading company legislation i have welcomed rapidly growing interest in the potential of this new opportunity and i have been gratified by the active support for trading company legislation over 130 of my colleagues have cosponsored my bill h r 1648 and i am sure they all share my enthusiastic support for h r 6016 the legislation we consider today when i first introduced my original bill during the 96th congress i was motivated in large part by concern about our deteriorating balance of trade unitedstates trade balances had been in deficit since 1975 with participating large deficits in 1977 and 1978 it seemed clear at that time that poor export performance was contributing july 2 7 1982 substantially to the deficits and that increased exports offered one of the more effective ways to remedy the problem those of us who looked closely at the structure of unitedstates trade and the structural impediments to increased exports were struck by the success of our competitors most notably the huge japanese trading companies operating in virtually every country in the world financed in part through strong ties to japanese banks and experienced in alternative trade mechanisms such as barter and threeway trading the japanese trading companies had grown enormously in fact they were becoming increasingly important as export agents for unitedstatesproduced goods from the beginning we used the japanese trading companies as a partial model for etc legislation but maintained careful attention to the different business and legal framework within which our own inst it utions must operate i reintroduced export trading company legislation during the early days of this congress with immediate bipartisan support it was clear that the need for stimulating exports had if anything increased the economic downturn had constricted domestic markets and a stronger dollar had made our exports more expensiveand thus less competitiveon world markets unfortunately those same forces remain today while it cannot fully compensate for them export trading legislation has become an important response to the pressures for new protectionist measures in this country the new administration accepted the need for export trading company legislation and endorsed my bill h r 1648 the senate moved swiftly on almost identical legislation s 734 and on april 8 1981 passed it unanimously by a vote of 93 to 0 in the house h r 1648 and similar bills had been referred to three separate committees and each proceeded independently but none could ignore the growing consensus both in congress and within the business community that export trading company legislation was an idea whose time had come our cause was bolstered by independent studies such as the one undertaken by the new england congressional institute it showed widespread support for the legislation within the business and banking communities and suggested that we would see immediate response to the new opportunities provided by the legislation other studies forecasted that the legislation might provide even more new jobs than originally anticipated an important consideration during this period of escalating unemployment growing awareness of the legislation was immediately translated into appeals for prompt congressional action on march 31 of this year the chairman of the house banking committee submitted his own proposal for the banking related elements of export trading company legislation i was among the original cosponsors of his bill h r 6016 the chairmans approach differed little from the banking title of my own bill and his bill included an additional export stimulus in a provision increasing the limits on bankers acceptances which provide a means of guaranteeing payment for goods being shipped during extensive hearings this spring the committee considered additional changes and refinements suggested by a broad crosssection of interested parties we heard from exporters potential exporters existing trading companies banks and bank regulators almost every witness suggested improvements designed to make the legislation more attractive to his own organization and it was left to the committee to sift through proposed changes in its final form h r 6016 represents careful study cooperation and compromise each element of the bill was subject to the same two tests will it make export trading companics more effective at meeting our export goals and will it be workable within the legal and regulatory structures of unitedstates banking the goal of this legislation has been clear from the beginning increasing exports during the hearings i restated my own conviction that export success not bank profits should be our objective certainly that will be the standard by which the legislation will be judged by a public eager for both the new jobs and the economic boost that exports can provide export trading companies have existed in this country for years but their growth and expansion have been severely limited by inadequate capital although several large corporations including sears and general electric have announced the formation of new trading company subsidiaries their impact at least initially will be limited formation of corporate sponsored etcs has given new impetus to our efforts to open the door to banking investments in trading companies but i doubt we will ever see an american replica of the japanese trading giants it would be too inconsistent with our own business and legal traditions i am convinced that bank investment in trading companies can contribute substantially by helping more unitedstates firms to become exporters in addition to new capital bank participation has the potential to improve the efficiency of trading company operations by making available the existing expertise and infrastructure possessed by large international banks contacts with potential customers familiarity with export financing and currency transactions and better means of evaluating the creditworthiness of foreign customers will all be facilitated by their worldwide networks of offices and affiliates because we felt that exploiting the recognition and goodwill associated with existing banking activities would stimulate exports the committee chose to permit holding companies to use their own names for trading company affiliates in other cases regional banks may choose to build upon their relationships with local business in order to encourage new export activities risk uncertainty and lack of familiarity with export procedures have all discouraged many small and medium sized firms from developing export markets but a wei3 run trading compa ny could substantially reduce those hurdles by linking with existing trading companies regional banks can provide the necessary expertise and financing to make exporting attractive to many more firms in addition because of their familiarity with the financial and management resources of local firms regional banks are uniquely equipped to help small companies meet the challenges of exportrelated growth in addressing the direct objective of increasing unitedstates exports ii r 6016 also represents an important step in the modernization of banking law authorization for bank investment in trading companies constitutes a significant relaxation of the historic legal separation of banking and commerce and the committee carefully reviewed the terms and conditions of such investments this legislation is designed to preserve necessary safeguards for the safety and soundness of our nations banking institutions while permitting bank holding companies to make better use of their substantial resources on a casebycase basis the committee relies on the substantial supervisory and regulatory resources of the federal reserve system to protect banks against the effects of unsound practices by their parent holding companies at the same time the committee also wished to insure that those resources not be applied to blocking legitimate investments a possibility introduced by the feds open scepticism about the legislation accordingly h r 6016 directs that the fed must be advised in writing at least 60 days in advance of a bank holding companys proposed investment in an etc and provides for an additional 30 days review period under defined circumstances absent a formal notice of disapproval from the fed the holding company is authorized to go ahead with the investment specific grounds for disapproval are outlined in the legislation and it was the committees intention that fed review be confined to legitimate questions of bank safety not unrelated activities of either the holding company or its other subsidiaries the legislation itself protects against excessive risk by limiting direct investment to 5 percent of the holding companys consolidated capital and surplus further loans from the holding company and all its other subsidiaries may not total more than 10 percent of the holding companys consolidated capital and surplus the bill approved by the banking committee defines export trading companies as organizations operated exclusively for the purpose of exporting or facilitating the export of goods and services made in the united stateo our choice of the word exclusively reflects a deliberate intention to focus the activities of etcs on exports rather than imports but h r 6016 clearly authorizes such importing activities as are necessary to facilitate exports and promote etc operations in foreign countries etcs are also authorized to make product modifications necessary to prepare unitedstates made goods for foreign markets and to take title to goods being exported an important element of trading company legislation is the explicit recognition of services as a distinct class of exports in fact a growing proportion of our export revenues comes from the services sector in its final form h r 6016 represents the culmination of a long evolutionary process a process marked by long discussion and careful study we have finetuned my original proposal and the resulting legislation will be an important stimulus to our economy thousands of unitedstates companies will now have access to a complete range of export assistance and many will find new prosperity in foreign markets my own involvement with this legislation has been very satisfying and i am pleased with the results of our efforts the banking committee can be proud of our success in drafting such excellent legislation i encourage the full house to support us today"], [0.45301133394241333, 0.5469886660575867, 1, "i rise in support of the consensus bill i think this can now be termed a bipartisan and noncontroversial bill and i am pleased to join with my colleagues in supporting its passage i first want to commend the members who have worked on this bill i think we have dealt with this bill in a responsible manner we have given our seabed mining companies what they need an interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my remarks in short i believe the bill before us meets the foreign policy and national security interests of this country as well as the interests of the seabed mining industry and i urge the members to vote for the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill from foreign affairs spring 19801"], [0.45386451482772827, 0.5461354851722717, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in

markets as well as prospects for continued depressed farm prices in the near term ccc is likely to own this grain at substantial additional cost for some time one of the primary reasons that agriculture finds itself in a depressed state is the deterioration in the farm export outlook the burden of record agricultural surpluses has been compounded by this reduction in the value of unitedstates farm exportsthe first such reduction since 1969 in addition certain commodities are experiencing a reduction in export volume as well as value corn export shipments for example are at a 5year low the dismal prospects for resumed strong growth in unitedstates export markets point to the need for developing additional domestic outlets for our grain production the development of an established alcohol fuels industry offers the potential for creating substantial new domestic demand for grain a goal which if realized could lead to strong and stable prices for american producers a mature alcohol fuels industry could also serve as a model for current efforts to promote the value added production and export for unitedstates goods for example those alcohol producers using the wet

1981 study by the unitedstates department of energys office of alcohol fuels based on mid1981 corn prices unitedstates onp would increase by 1 89 for each bushel of corn diverted from the export market to produce ethanol similar studies have projected the increased employment national income and balance of payments benefits that would likely accrue to the united states if a strong alcohol

predictable consequences fear by individual votes of retaliation by the right wing for failing to vote in the election intimidation of voters by the armed forces a desire by the salvadoran people to break the cycle of violence for they are the victims of this civil war their government is responsible for vicious atrocities and repression against the people elections have historically beenused by the right wing and the military to legitimize their position however as degraded as the democratic process has been in that country this election at least offered the salvadoran people a means of expressing their rejection of violence the election however does not mean that el salvador has a democracy the united states cannot regard elections during a civil war by a repressive government as the means by which a people democratically elect a legitimate government it would be the most dangerous kind of wishful thinking on the part of the united states to put behind us or now to excuse the circumstances under which this election was held or to believe that the election has ended them the cornerstone of the reagan administration policy on el salvador has been that the march 28 elections would produce an election victory for the christian democratic party and for president jose napolean duarte the administration sought support in congress and among the american people for continued and increasing military and economic aid to the government of el salvador on the grounds that the aid was necessary to strengthen the moderate civilian elements within the ruling junta the commitment of the christian democratic party to social and economic reform was used to justify a policy of unitedstates intervention and support for a rightwing oppressive military guilty of gross violations of human rights that unitedstates policy suffered from a fatal defect in that president duarte and the christian democratic party did not have control over the military the defense minister gereral garcia controls the military but duarte did not and does not control garcia after my visit to el salvador in february i had serious reservations about holding an election in a country locked in a civil war i believed that it was essential to end the killing and the violence first then through negotiations bring all political parties into the elections process and then to hold elections in an atmosphere of peace time and time again our congressional delegation heard how elections had been used in the past to legitimatize a repressive right wing government in 1972 the military deprived president duarte of his rightful victory in the presidential election i became concerned that even if president duarte won this election the outcome would not alter the fundamental defect in the duarte governmentthe inability of civilian moderate forces to exercise control over the military my fear was that the election would legitimatize the de facto control that gen jose guillermo garcia exercises over the government and the people the election however did not produce the result around which the state department had structured unitedstates policy while the christian democratic party won over 40 percent of the vote the majority of the 60 seats in the legislative assembly will be held by right wing parties the extreme right wing nationalist republican alliance arena founded only last year by roberto daubuisson will be the second largest party with approximately 29 percent of the seats the right wing parties will now attempt to form a coalition government to exclude president duarte and the christian democrats the reagan administration will attempt to insure that some christian democrats are included in any new government the administration may also succeed in persuading the right wing coalition not to make daubuisson leader of a coalition government the administration correctly recognizes that it would be impossible for it to obtain support in congress for a government in which daubuisson is either the leader or highly visible the coalition government will not be any more deserving of military assistance from the united states if daubuisson is not a member of the government we should not delude ourselves into believing that all will go well daubilission is excluded from the government we should not think that our policy in el salvador suddenly went wrong only on sunday because duarte did not receive a majority of the votes our policy was wrong before then and is wrong now because it has emphasized support for the military in el salvador over civilian reformist elements within the government and among the people because the united states has failed to insist that the government of el salvador meet the conditions on aid imposed by congress in the foreign assistance act of 1981 as a result of my visit to el salvador i was convinced of the wisdom of the conditions that we in the congress imposed upon that aid we required among other conditions that the government of el salvador make a goodfaith effort to enter into negotiations with all political factions within el salvador that the government make progress toward ending the abuse of human rights by the military the conditions set in law by congress would constitute a sound basis for unitedstates policy in el salvador the united states cannot lose sight of the longrange implications of our policy in that country we cannot give elections in el salvador the same value that we would give to elections in the united states we cannot pretend that an election in el salvador forms the same basis for legitimate government that an election in the united states does our country enjoys longestablished democratic institutions americans were holding democratic elections in the united states before there was actually a united states such elections have almost never been held in el salvadorperhaps twice in its entire history i urge the house the congress the american people to reaffirm their commitment to human rights as a basis for unitedstates policy in el salvador i would very much like to see the united states persuade whatever government is formed in el salvador to undertake negotiations necessary to end the civil war through a political solution my concern is for the people of el salvador who have been the victims of violence from both the right and the left i am deeply concerned however that a coalition of rightwing parties will attempt to win a military victory that will escalate tremendously the violence within el salvador the real victims of such escalation will not be the forces of the leftwing or the rightwing they will be the inno cent the young the old women and children i do not believe that the united states should be providing arms that will be used to kill those innocent victims that concern should be fundamental to our policy whether the president of el salvador is jose napolean duarte or roberto daubuisson or some other

current laws have served the nation well for over 75 years recent events have demonstrated the need to provide the food and drug administration and the secretary of hhs with the ability to respond with flexibility and to use the latest and best scientific knowledge available interest in substantial improvement of these laws is now nearly 5 years old since the beginning of major controversy over fdas decision to propose a ban on saccharin in march 1977 and continuing with the debate over the safety of nitrite numerous proposals have been developed to try to protect the public interest while permitting the appropriate level of scientific flexibility and administrative discretion some of the proposals have been too simplistic in their attempts to singlemindedly apply emerging and imperfect concepts like costbenefit analysis more recently others have been developed like s 1442 introduced by senator hatch that contain a number of new approaches but are both too complex administratively as well as too ambitious in the nature of some of the proposed changes the bill i introduce today has the advantage of examining these earlier proposals instead of reacting in either an emotional way during crisis situations or trying to change the world in one fell swoop it focuses on only the major problems in what is basically a good law it is intended to be concise in its approach to issues and will serve to focus the debate during the coming months the bill proposes six kinds of changes to the current food drug and cosmetic act first it recognizes as have the courts that there is a level of risk particularly in the area of indirect food additives that can be described as de minimis second it maintains a high standard of public safety while permitting the secretary to use the best scientific judgment available in determining safety by defining safe as a reasonable certainty that the risks of a substance under the intended conditions of use are insignificant because of existing interpretations this standard gives adequate legislative guidance to the fda without improving either quantitative risk assessment or an overly rigid congressional determination of safety third it permits the secretary to phase substances out of the food supply for periods of up to 5 years depending on the availability of substitutes and the nature of the health risk involved it also permits under narrow circumstances where no alternatives are available for critical substances the weighing of health benefits against health risks the bill does not permit the weighing of economic benefits to one part of the population against health risks to another fourth it authorizes the development of external peer review mechanisms for food safety decisions in either the national academy of sciences the federation of american societies of american biology or other institutions of the secretarys choice it does this in such a way that the decisionmaking authority still rests with the government on decisions and it permits all sides of questions including members of public interest groups to petition for review of decisions fifth the bill clarifies that the class of basic and traditional foods like potatoes peanuts nutmeg et cetera be held to a safety standard that requires the secretary to show that the use of these foods would be ordinarily injurious to health before he takes regulatory action as science proceeds the development of this category is necessary to insure that the fda does not have to take actions that are demonstrably foolish from the publics perspective for example if a cancercausing substance should be found in ordinary potatoes and it cannot be removed the secretary should not be in the position of either violating the law or banning potatoes sixth finally the bill simplifies the regulatory process for the issuance of tolerances for substances that rhould not be in foods like pcbs but which are often unavoidable current law discourages the setting of tolerances because the process is extremely burdensome by simplifying the process the fda will be able to let the public know what substances are in their food and permit the public to make informed decisions on the permissible levels in the absence of change decisions will continue to be made exclusively by bureaucratic fiat it is important to note that this change does not in any way change the governments responsibility to protect the public against these substances in the past much of the attention paid to the food safety laws has focused on the socalled delaney anticancer clause this is natural inasmuch as that clause represents the symbolic commitment of our society to protect us against any level of risk from cancer in our food supply it is a noble concept and one should not approach the changing of it lightly in examining the possibility of change i have increasingly come to the opinion however that we must have regulatory statutes that are both tough and realistic if the laws are to maintain the respect of the people with respect to the current delaney clause i now believe that first its importance in the actual administration of the statutes has been vastly overstated the general safety clause of the law is by far a more important tool in the regulatory arsenal second its absolutist approach ignores our ability to measure substances in increasingly small amounts and third its maintenance in an unchanged way is likely ultimately to bring the public agency that must enforce it into disrepute by forcing actions that may be demonstrably foolish because i strongly believe in the importance of a powerful but credible food and drug administration i think it is important to bring the delaney clause and the general safety clause into accord and to permit the secretary to judge with appropriate procedural safeguards when the risk of an added substance is insignificant if we do not do this explicitly by legislation we will be guilty of passing the buck back to the bureaucrats while permitting ourselves the luxury of strong criticism every time the agency does something we think is foolish this is bad public policy because it is ultimately destructive of respect for public institutions and the goals of the regulatory establishment that we have constructed as many of you know i have been strongly critical of many of this administrations actions in the health and safety regulatory arena i believe that many of the budget actions taken in the environmental protection agency for example are backdoor ways of dismantling public protection in the guise of regulatory relief in contrast i believe that this bill approaches regulatory reform in the serious and constructive fashion that the issue demands we do need to wrestle with the regulatory establishment we have created but we need to recognize the massive benefits in public protection that we have gained over the last decades i believe that this bill represents the kind of midcourse correction that will be good for both producers and consumers in the past months i have been critical of other attempts to change the law in my view that is part of the natural process of give and take on important public policy issues it is important to recognize however that senator hatch and many of my colleagues in the house have made important contributions in raising the right questions about the laws i look forward to working with all concerned parties to insure that the american people are adquately protected a sectionbysection analysis follows"],

military standpoint but also from the perspective of a country struggling to reduce the rapid pace of the nuclear arms race if we are truly serious about strengthening our defense capability we will today put an end to this kind of wasteful unjustified expenditure the proposed mx missile program represents nothing more than a tremendous diversion of critical resources away from areas of genuine need both within and outside of the defense budget study after study has concluded that our most pressing military need is not the purchase of increasingly costly and sophisticated nuclear weaponry rather our needs are in the conventional forces areain the improvement of the morale and competence of our personnel in the provision and maintenance of our basic equipment in the adequacy of basic logistical support yet as the country gears up for a massive nuclear buildup it is these elements of our military preparednesselements essential to real national securitythat are by and large ignored perhaps the greatest absurdity of the mx is that it is proposed as a means of enhancing american deterrence when our nuclear forces already provide a tremendously powerful counterthrect to soviet aggression to put the issue of our nuclear deterrent in perspective it should be noted that even if the soviet union launched a first strike against the united statesa strike that was so extraordinarily successful that it totally eliminated our landbased nuclear force our airborne nuclear fleet and all the nuclear submarines that are in port at any one timethere would remain at sea 20 nuclear submarines each carrying 16 missiles each missile carrying 8 to 10 warheads each warhead having an explosive power seven times that of the bomb that fell on hiroshima these 20 subs alone would be sufficient to destroy every major economic industrial and population center in the soviet union three times over in terms of accuracy size and survivability the unitedstates nuclear force is more than sufficient to deter soviet aggression and in the absence of any operable agreement on strategic arms limitation the decision to develop even greater nuclear capability will only fuel the already growing threat of a major and destabilizing arms race but these are military arguments that have been addressed and addressed effectively by those who have proceeded me i think what really requires discussion at this point are the broader implications of the approach that we appear to be taking to national defense issuesan approach that is symbolized by the mx missile debate what is happening is thatout of a sense of fear unsupported by evidence or reasonwe are indiscriminantly throwing dollars at the pentagon and in the process we are ending up with less security rather than more moreover the kind of unnecessary and uineconomic military investment which we consider todaythe quintessential example of which is the mx missileundermines the very economic foundations of our nation and thereby our national security it is difficult to conceptualize the sheer magnitude of the defense program being promoted by the administration over the next 5 years the united states will spend over 1 6 trillion on defense 1 6 trillion if we were to spend that sum at the rate of 1 million per day 365 days a year it would take over 4 000 years to exhaust the war chest put another way over the course of the next 5 years we will be spending on the average 830 million a day on defense alone the economic implications of the defense buildup are staggering last fall the pentagon asked such luminaries as the nobel laureate lawrence klein otto eckstein and michael evans along with forecasting firms such as chase econometrics and merrill lynch economics to examine the impacts of rising military spending their conclusion large increases in the military budget will lead to greater deficit spending and with tax reductions exceeding cuts in social spending the defense increases will push the federal budget even further into the redmeaning continuing high interest rates and continuing high rates of inflation but that is only part of the economic cost of wasteful and excessive military spending economists are also warning us that our defense spending binge by diverting scarce capital and technical expertise away from other sectors of our economy threatens directly our efforts to revitalize our private industrial base we are all keenly aware of the tremendous difficulties the united states has encounteredin recent years in the competition with the germans and japanese and the explanation for our difficulties is traceable directly to their relatively greater commitment of capital to the private sectors of their economies over the past decade american fixed capital investment as a percentage of our nations gross national product ranged between 17 percent and 19 percent during the same period german fixed capital investment was between 20 percent and 26 percent of gnp and japanese fixed capital investment was in the 31 percent to 36 percent range is it any wonder that modem and efficient japanese and german firms have been able to overtake the aging american industrial system for emphasis it should be noted that in 1977 for every 100 of new fixed capital formation the united states applied 46 to the military sector in sharp contrast in japan only 3 70 of every 100 of new fixed capital formation was applied to the military this concentration of japans capital on productive economic growth goes far to explain the current success of that countrys industry where productivity grew 6 2 percent in 1980 by contrast aging plants and equipment in the united states led to a decrease in the average output per person in manufacturing industries of 0 5 percent the important point in the context of the legislation before us is that this economic disparity will only widen if we fal to bring defense spending under control and if we fail to recognize the overall economic impact of wasteful defense expenditures as economist bruce russett has noted every dollar in military spending results in a new loss of over 27 cents in fixed investment in civilian goods and a drop in personal consumption of 42 cents interest sensitive sectors like housing and durable goods cars appliances and furniture are especially hard hit when excessive arms spending bids up the cost of borrowing this loss of investment and consumption to the military decreases longterm growth opportunities making job creation difficult and preventing any growth in real wages if in the process of arming america we allow our countrys economy to decay i submit that we will have only weakened our nations security clearly the question before us today is not whether we can afford both guns and butter we can and must afford both but what we cannot afford is waste and extravagancebe that in domestic or in military programs and we must recognize that our national security is as dependent upon our economic strength as it is upon the number of missiles in our nuclear arsenal this is the real meaning of the amendment offered by the gentleman from new york it offers us an opportunity to pare back the kind of wasteful military expenditures that have no real military utility and are so economically destructive i commend mr addabbo for his effort and urge the

information from the government to the public as well as between scientists in the united states and those overseas this is a most ominous development with farreaching implications that i do not believe the administration has fully grasped several actions on the part of the executive add up to a most worrisome picture it has been well publicized that new policies are being implemented which will restrict contacts between government officials and the press in addition a new executive order is being drafted which will give government officials greater authority to invoke national security to keep information from the public through the classification procedure the administration is also moving to rewrite the provisions of the freedom of information act which has served the nation so well since its enactment in 1966 in such a way as to restrict both the material that can be made public and those who may demand the information finally and equally troublesome are the efforts at restricting the flow of scientific information by use of the classification procedure by censorship prior to publication and by means of regulations based on the authority of the arms export and control actadministered by the department of commerceand the international traffic in arms regulationsadministered by the state department admiral inman deputy director of the central intelligence agency produced at the recent annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science a list of subjects for classification or restriction that includes crop forecasting computer software and computer hardware it is not difficult to see the sweeping range of those i roposals in response to criticisms th the national security agency had not made its case for classifying certain cryptographic material admiral inman responded this reasoning is circular and unreasonable the specific details of why information must be protected are often even more damaging than the information itself this justification in itself is a brilliant exercise in circular reasoning it requires that the public place absolute faith and power to control information in the hands of these gentlemen admiral inman then proceeded to characterize scientists arguments for free flow of information as being motivated by selfinterest entirely disregarding the societys stake in this freedom every new administration inevitably goes through a phase of believing it is more important to stem leaks of sensitive or embarrassing material rather than dealing with the substance of the issue while this is understandable we must remain on guard because this administration more than any other stands a good chance of codifying this institutional paranoia into the laws of the land once again we witness the banner of national security being raised to justify all manner of restrictions on the free and necessary flow of information the nation has grown weary of this demagoguery especially when the sweepingly road concept of national interest is freely used in place of national security this nation was founded by individuals who had a healthy distrust for government based not on ideology but on personal experience of its excesses in consequence every effort was made to define rights responsibilities and individual restrictions by means of statutes enacted by congress so as not to fall victim to the capricious interpretations by faceless bureaucrats or officials with narrow perspectiver of the democratic process i believe this is not in contradiction with the present administrations philosophy national security is too important to be left to security specialists alone congress and the executive should be especially careful with language in this area spelling out clearly what is meant by national security they must recognize explicitly that information which is merely embarrassing to government officials does not qualify for being suppressed under the rubric of national security or even national interest quite the contrary such information is properly a part of the public domain for without it the constitutionally mandated system of checks and balances becomes inoperative the oversight function of congress was instituted precisely to deal with competing interests conflicts of policy inefficiency waste and mismanagement restrictions on the public dissemination of governmental information inevitably translates into congiessional ignorance on key matters lor it is well known that congress functions by reacting to public concerns not by initiating public debate for congress to acquiesce to the executives efforts in restricting information is to abdicate its constitutional role beyond the petty issues of embarassing revelations lies the larger question of striking an appropriate balance between the publics rightand needto know and genuine concern for national security matters this is a valid and difficult question precisely because of this it is imperative that the public through it5 elected representatives participate in the process of deciding what it chooses not to know for the sake of the good of the nation as a whole unfortunately this administration has failed to recognize the fact that the publics need to know is fundamental to the workings of a democratic nation and that the press is the sehicle by which this right is exercised the executive appears to view the press as yet another selfserving special interest group and the publics need to know as merely a manifestation of an inappropriate curiosity through its actions regarding revisions of the freedom of information act the new executive order on classification of sensitive material its restrictions on contacts with the press and regulations that restrict communication within the scientific community the administration is effectively shifting the burden of proof of need to know to the end user on a casebycase basis while at the same time eliminating some of the vehicles by which the user might establish such need this in itself is prima fade evidence that the administration does not accept the publics need to know as a right this contradictory situation is further aggravated by the fact that if the public is not aware of the existence of certain important information it will not know to ask for it through the remaining channels fortunately the administrations moves toward information control have met with unprecedented resistance the washington post of january 22 1982 reports vocal protests to the national security adviser by reporters who cover the state department indicating that the change in policy is having chilling effects with officials now reluctant to discuss or even explain basic points of policy universities find themselves in open confrontation with the government refusing to abide by its restrictive regulations regarding meetings with foreign scientistslos angeles times january 20 1982 the otherwise staid national academy of sciences has refused to act as an intermediary between the universities and the state department because it would reflect acceptance of its restrictive policieswashington post january 21 1982 the governing council of the american association for the advancement of science the nations most prestigious scientific society passed a resolution on january 7 1982 disapproving of the governments policies whereas freedom and national security are best preserved by adherence to the principles of openness that are a fundamental tenet of both the american society and of the scientific process be it resolved that the american association for the advancement of science opposes governmental restrictions on the dissemination exchange or availability of unclassified knowledge professional and academic journals are filled with editorials strongly opposing attempts to restrict the flow of scientific information i wish to call to the attention of my colleagues three such statements one by prof edward gerjouy from the university of pittsburgh who chairs the panel on public affairs of the american physical society another by prof stephen unger from columbia university and an excellent editorial by daniel s greenberg the editor and publisher of the washington based science government report editorials appended there is another aspect of this question that must not be forgotten the united states leadership in the field of communications and data processing the united states has held long standing bipartisan policies aimed at facilitating and preventing restrictions on transnational data flows which are very important to international trade and to the functioning of many unitedstates firms that operate overseas we have argued strenuously for the benefits of unrestricted data flow and against the imposition of restrictions on communications such as through the new world information order the administrations actions regarding the flow of information leaving the united states are in direct contradiction to these long standing policies and invite retaliation from other nations which could severely cripple unitedstates leadership trade position as well as intelligence gathering ability for these reasons it is imperative that congress not deal with each of the administrations actions in a piecemeal fashion but be aware of the overall picture they represent if we were on a war footing perhaps the measures proposed by the administration might be justifiable for a short interval but we arenot and the damage and costs that will have to be borne if we accede to the kinds of restrictions envisioned will be farreaching it is ironic that in the single minded pursuit of the antisoviet posture that characterizes this administrations policies we should end up using precisely the same methods of information control for which we so fault them"], [0.4591880440711975, 0.5408119559288025, 1, "first let me say that i think the gentleman is providing a real service by discussing this issue it is an issue that the house of representatives seems more interested in ignoring than facing i think it is time for this house to turn back and start analyzing the kinds of issuet that the late honorable wright patman talked about for 30 years in this house and that is the structure of the federal reserve board i introduced a piece of legislation that i call the paul volcker retirement act i did that early in this congress i did not do it so much to focus on the chairman of the federal reserve board as a person as to talk about the institution of the federal reserve board and the inability of the people of this country who are in a governing position to deal with monetary policy as long as we have a federal reserve board that is completely and thoroughly independent i went back and read the things that have been written about the creation of the federal reserve board president wilson the democrats and the republicans in congress said we thought we ought to have a federal reserve board to try to stop and try to monitor some of these cantankerous practices of some of th local banks out there in the country but we sure do not want to be creating with this federal reserve board a strong independent bank here we are 70 years later and what we have is a strong independent bank accountable to no one federal reserve board members are appointed for a 14year term they are not accountable to the president they are not accountable to the congress they develop monetary policy at their own time in their own ways and consequently we come to a point in our history at which fiscal policy and monetary policy collide they are not united in a combined strategy that makes much sense for the future of this country we are told that high interest rates today are part of an economic solution in fact it is part of the economic problem some say use fiscal policy cut spending cut taxes and that will add up to a balanced budget it does not but that is the current fiscal policy strategy it is all based upon supplyside economics which means you need explosive bursts of economic growth to enable supplyside economics to work on the other hand you have monetary policy which is policy guaranteed to try and retard economic growth in the country that is why we have moved into a recession monetary policy is designed to retard economic growth so we have on the one hand fiscal policy which requires economic growth and substantial amounts of it to work and on the other hand we have monetary policy that retards economic growth and throws the country into a recession it is the most schizophrenic kind of economic policy that i have ever heard of in my life there are people in town who believe that somehow it will work it will not work it is economic faith healing it is wishbone economics it simply is not based on economic logic at all i want to say to the gentleman that his discussion of the structure of the federal reserve board is extraordinarily productive because that is what we need to be discussing today in congress tax cuts do not mean anything to a main street business person who is not earning a profit because he is paying 20percent interest rates you give him a tax cut and it does not mean a thing the fact is you only pay taxes if you earn f profit i do not know of many main street businesses in this country which are earning profits by having to pay 18 or 20 percent interest rates on the capital they need to operate their business that just is not happening so we are addressing the wrong thing it is like mowing your lawn while your house is burning the interest rates represents the burning house and we have to deal with interest rates in a structural way that gets right back to the issue the gentleman is talking about what ought the federal reserve boards role be in this government should it be an independent role capable of creating a strategy of monetary policy that is inconsistent with the fiscal policy strategy of course not that is not a reasonable approach i think it is time people in the congress begin realizing that this contradictory strategy of monetary and fiscal policy is not logical and will not work in conclusionand i appreciate the gentleman allowing me the time to visit about interest rates and monetary policyi would like to say further that the federal reserve board has put us in a position of starving the most productive sector of the american economy we starve from a credit standpoint the small business and the family farms and at the same time mobil oil co is out there getting 5 6 billion worth of credit to try to buy conoco now they are gobbling up credit to try to buy marathon oil there is not one new job created from that kind of activity there is no new productivity created from that kind of activity it is a completely useless and inefficient economic activity in this country the most productive segment of our economy is being starved and we are rewarding the least productive for the purposes of acquisition and concentration of corporate power chipping away at the free enterprise system none of that makes any sense so we do need a more coherent monetary strategy so that the folks in this country who need credit to build productive small businesses with to create new jobs with get that kind of credit only then can they have the kind of business that prospers and grows along with the economy of this country i do not think the president is solely to blame for the interest rates obviously the federal reserve board develops monetary policy but the fact is that the president has supported this monetary policy he has said so time and time and time again i heard some colleagues on the floor of this house just the other day talking about how this program is working this program is working they say well if this program is working the hindenburg is still trying to park and the titanic is still sailing the fact is this program is not working it has only been in force 40 or 50 days but already we have seen the estimates change on the expected fiscal year 1982 deficit from 42 billion to upward of 80 billion the fact is it will not work because we have inconsistent monetary and fiscal policies we have to get it straightened out but even more importantly we have to address the longterm structure of the federal reserve board that is why i think the gentleman is dead right i have not put my name to the current resolution the gentleman is speaking about but i have several bills of my own in and several resolutions in on the federal reserve board i commend the gentleman for bringing this to the attention of the house day after day after day as more people begin to understand that tight money is the problem not the solution then we will begin dealing with that problem and create better economic solutions for the people of this country that really work i

wallenberg to be an honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who underscored the critical importance from both a national and international perspective of recognizing raoul wallenberg in this unique way for the unprecedented things he did at our request"],

wildlife populations and outdoor recreational and educational opportunities also diminish or disappear while continued federal acquisition of needed conservation easements is a part of the solution other essentially nonfederal solutions also need to be impleniented h r 4680 was such a proposal it was designed to provide tax relief to those who sell certain lands or easements toqualified agencies and organizations for conservation purposes since its introduction i have received a significant number of very constructive improvement suggestions from a variety of conservation groups and others the discussions followingsenator wallops public lands workshop last summer have also provided additional valuable information accordingly i elected to redraft this legislation somewhat to clarify several definitions and to avoid conflict with existing tax incentives for donations of partial interests in land for conservation purposes the primary purpose and intent of h r 6465 remains the same as h r 4680 that purpose is to exclude from gross income for tax purposes amounts received from certain sales of key natural area lands to qualified organizations including the various states and the united states if the primary use of such land after the sale is for a conservation purpose and that purpose is protected in perpetuity the primary change in this new legislation is to delete the definitions contained in h r 4680 and to adopt the conservation terms previously approved by the congress and enacted into law in the tax treatment extension act of 1980 the tax treatment extension act of 1980 public law 96541 insured the deductibility of the donation of gifts of partial interests in land for conservation purposes at the time that proposal was subject to intensive review the result was a thorough and carefully structured law the tax treatment extension act is only applicable to partial interest donations that are within a carefully defined list of conservation purposes the conservation purposes must be protected in perpetuity and the recipient of the donation must be a qualified notforprofit or governmental organization with the commitment and resources necessary to protect the conservation purpose in essence i have taken the solutions worked out by the congress last session with regard to donations for natural conservation purposes and applied them to sales of conservation areas for a conservation purpose one problem identified with regard to h r 4680 was the negative impact on donations the incentive to donate to a conservation organization for a conservation purpose would be lost if an incentive to sell also applied h r 6465 corrects that situation i have structured this new bill so that it will complement not restrict existing incentives for donations the tax treatment extension act is applicable to the donation of a partial interest that is less than an owners entire interest in a given area h r 6465 covers the opposite situation where an owner wants to sell his entire interest rather than retain limited rigihts or sell a conservation easement for fish and wildlife purposes in this manner an incentive to sell will not generally be applicable to the same interest in land that is covered by the tax treatment extension act an owner has to sell his entire interest or an easement for fish and wildlife conservation purposes to be covered by h r 6465 this could of course overlap with a donation of an owners entire interest but unlike partial interest donations donations of this kind would not insure conservetion protection and therefore geierally serve a different purpose however h r 6465 covers conservation easements sold to qualified organizations for fish and wildlife conservation purposes because of the critical special needs in this area this new legislation also provides federal estate tax relief in certain cases permitting the value of qualified property transferred to a qualified organization to be considered as payment of part or all of the estate taxes due and the postponement of estate taxes due on qualified property being transferred to a qualified organization until the transfer is completed or cancelled in summary h r 6465 excludes gain from the sale or exchange of real property to a qualified organization for conservation purposes the term qualified organization is given the same meaning as provided by the tax treatment extension act similarly the term conservation purpose is defined in reference to that act but limited to three major natural conservation purposes as follows the preservation of land areas for outdoor recreation by or the education of the general public the protection of a relatively natural habitat of fish wildlife or plants or similar ecosystem or the preservation of open space including farmland and forest landwhere such preservation isone for the scenic enjoyment of the general public or two pursuant to a clearly delineated federal state or local governmental conservation policy and will yield a significant public benefit while restrictive these major natural conservation purposes are flexible enough to insure that areas sold to conservation organizations for a conservation purpose can continue to be used and managed as necessary for maintaining the conservation purpose these are not wilderness area categories no lands would be converted to wilderness areas under this legislation traditional conservation management practices and recreation uses such as hunting and fishing would be permitted to be continued however the conservation purpose would have to be protected in perpetuity h r 6465 addresses several other key issues third party transactions would be permitted the sale to a nonqualified organizationsuch as a major corporationwould be covered if the purchaser thereafter contributes such property to a qualified organization within 6 months the legislation would not be applicable to shortterm transactionsthe exclusion would only apply if the gain in question was longterm capital gains rhe legislation would not be applicable to governmental acquisition by actual seizure requisition or condemnation it would be applicable however if the property were merely under the threat of condemnationsuch as if it were within the boundaries of a conservation area or purchased on a willing seller basis this is an important distinction this legislation is primarily designed to encourage private state and local sales to the degree it applies to federal transactions it can only be costeffective if it encourages prompt transactions the cost of this incentive cannot be supported if it is added to the expense of costly condemnation proceedings h r 6465 also has a 10year sunset provision which will insure that sales for a conservation purpose are not delayed the intent is to deal as quickly as possible with present holdings and thus prevent them from being stripped down or subdivided and then sold for a less desirable conservation purpose many years hence this provision is not applicable in cases where the sale is of a taxpayers entire remaining interest which follows the donation of an earlier qualified partial interest contribution many opportunities to retain lands for conservation purposes in this nation are being lost every day early enactment of this legislation will help avoid further rapid loss of this nations critical open space outdoor recreation areas and special fish and wildlife habitats e"], [0.5403221249580383, 0.5403221249580383, 0, "i rise to support this bill the house at long last today debates a bill that has been discussed studied reviewed and argued about for 4 years it was first introduced in 1979 by my colleague neal smith from iowa it is based on a highly successful model at the national science foundation that since 1977 has tested and proven the principle that small businesses are an innovative power that has remained untapped for far too long in 1979 the president directed that agencies develop their own sbir program in 1980 the white house conference on small business made this one of their top 15 priorities along with the small business and university patent act that this body already has passed in 1981 the president went on record supporting the companion bill in the senate which passed 90 to 0 in 1982 the president committed to this concept in his state of small business report here we are today debating this bill because no agency except dod has moved an inch to begin an sbir prograin what we are doing here today is what should not be necessary but asking requesting promotingall has done no good we know we need a change look at what we have now of all federal r d 95 percent goes to big business and nonprofit organizationsforeign contracts and state local equals 1 5 percent small business equals 3 5 percent what have we received for this highly centralized program where 60 percent of all contracts are sole source a department of commerce report cites 36 firms doing 60 percent of all unitedstates industrial research 20 universities receive 40 percent of all federal funds to such institutions patent filings by unitedstates firms have dropped by 13 percent in the last decade now 40 percent of all unitedstates patents are from foreign firms in 1980 alone 11 percent of all unitedstates patents went to japanese firms and individualsbusiness week productivity rates an area where america was once the leader have decreased tenfold in the last decade what this bill is all about is competition and free enterprise this bill brings to an almost closed system an opportunity for small business to apply its innovative creative entrepreneural force why do we need this bill that the president and every small business group i know of clearly supports we must open up the doors of competition until january of this year no forprofit business could even apply for an nih grantnope but in 1979 my committee received a letter from the director at nih stating that the agency would change its regulations but those regulatory changes came just this year only after the senate passed this bill and the house committee reported it out unanimously the secretary of energy testified in 1980 that he would voluntarily start an sbir program none yet exists let us give small business a chance small businessmen and individual inventors have a great record of innovation a national science foundation study shows that during a 20year period ending in 1973 almost half of all major unitedstates innovations came from smaller firms look back to xerography polaroid cameras and the laser these are only a few of the major technological breakthroughs that have come from small business these small businesses do more than just develop innovationsthey make jobs small hightech firms have an 88 percent greater employment rate than the average of all businesses17year study by docand they pay taxes34 percent more per dollar of sales than mature companies and they decrease product prices not increase them44 percent less price increases than the average firm the question is how long must we sit before we recognize what is right in front of us our nation needs to unleash the innovative job creative tax paying power of small business in 1975 the president created a blue ribbon panel to look at why our nations technological base was deteriorating their findings support what we are trying to do here today and were the basis for the nsf test the report found that small businesses face impediments in federal r d procurement not found in the private sector the report agreed to by every senior cabinet department official directs that changes be made but they have not occurred we must now do by statute wlfat could have been done years ago why must this program be mandatory because 6 years of inaction make it clear that the bureaucracy will not 9hange unless required to do so it is too easy for them to just wait it out we know from the nih example that they will not change unless forced to do it we want to open the door providing a way to bring innovative ideas into use in testimony given by a small anticancer drug manufacturer who had five derivitives that proved positive in initial tests we heard that this forprofit business did not qualify at nih so they formed a nonprofit subsidiary and got funding on two out of three proposals is this the way we must do business just the other day a small business that testified before our committee announced that it has perfected the commercial production of interferon from genespliced yeast its seed money came not from nih it could not qualify here is how our program will work each agency decides what its own research priorities are then in phase i of the sbir program the agency decides on which research topics among these priorities small business can submit proposals these proposals are evaluated on the basis of scientific and technical merit and feasibility they are eligible for up to 50 000 for feasibility research in phase ii awards up to 500 000 are available but merit and feasibility are the keys our competition is based on merit and feasibility will there be competition yes our twoline tests show that there were eight qualifying projects for each one funded at nsf and 10 to 1 at dod that is competition this idea works since the korean war when dod realized how important small business was to the defense effort we have had a small business setaside our most recent test 1982 shows that when the air force setaside 181 contracts for hightech spare parts it saved 38 5 percent per contract average savings on some contracts ran as high as 99 5 percent test savings were 6 7 million

commitment to ending world hunger harry chapin inspired an invigorating confidence that it was possible for policies and programs to be changed that the energies resources and great talents of our nation could be mobilized to breathe a fresh new life into the great humanitarian principles for which we want our nation to stand in one of his many finely crafted probing ballads harry queried now if a man tried to take his time on earth and prove before he died what one mans life could be worth well i wonder what would happen to this world during his short lifetime harry proved to so many people what his life was worth he was vision confidence inspiration unbridled energy and selfless dedication to others and his life matteredhe made a difference he constantly reminded us that hundreds of millions of people suffer from hunger and malnutrition that hunger makes every day for them a struggle whether or not their plight makes the nightly news or the morning paper as harry reviewed the cold statistics of hunger they became even more dramatic he reminded us that hunger is most vicious when it stalks the young that 100 000 children go blind each year because of vitamin deficiencies that in some poorer countries almost half the children die before reaching the age of 5 mostly from nutritionrelated diseases and that among the survivors handicaps of learning behavior and work capacity are widespread due to inadequate diets and recurring illness harry would repeat to himself and to millions of others that these conditions did not have to exist and people listened and they read and they learned that we do have the basic technological knowhow and resources to alleviate the hunger problem it became plain to those who began to familiarize themselvbs with the many dimensions and facets of the hunger problem that our task is formidable indeed but that is where harry came in many of my colleagues will attest to the fact that is was difficult if not impossible to avoid becoming totally enveloped in harrys electric enthusiasm he sparked a realization that the job was not going to get any easier that the time had come to roll up our sleeves to construct a comprehensive strategy against hunger more finely tuning those programs with a demonstrated record of success and terminating those programs which actually exacerbated the hunger problem i first met harry during the summer of 1977 he had come to washington seeking support for an idea he and his wife sandy had conceived creating a presidential commission on world hunger to find ways that our nation could develop more effective policies to combat hunger and malnutrition more comfortable in the jeans and casual shirts and shoes his fans recognized him in harry had come to town in a conservative threepiece suit that lobbying suit as harry liked to call it was to get quite a workout during the next year in between the hundreds of concerts he performedmore than half to benefit the hungerfighting activities of his world hunger year and food policy center organizationshe would return to washington to lobby for his hunger commission singlehandedly harry stormed the capitol along with me harry persuaded our former colleague rick nolan and senators pat leaiiy and bob dole to introduce a resolution urging the president to establish the commission he soon generated enough interest in the conmmission to attract 265 cosponsors in the house and 51 in the senate the presidential commission on world hunger was finally established in 1978 during the course of the next 2 years harry never missed a commission meeting often exhausted after a night of performing at a concert and the logistical nightmare of grabbing any available means of transportation to get back to washington for the commission meeting the next day harry nevertheless injected a spirit of infectious enthusiasm into those meetings he was the conscience of the commission everurging us to explore the deeply rooted causes of hunger and prodding us to produce a final report which did not equivocate did not pull any punches in detailing those actions our nation would have to take if the hunger problem was to be resolved harry chapin led our commissions efforts to involve the public in our deliberations and to explore ways to mobilize public opinion in support of comprehensive policy initiatives against hunger the commissions report did not reflect unanimous support for each of its findings or conclusions with differences of opinion noted in our report but we did provide the chief executive and the american public with some good thoughtful recommendations producing a document which has served as a vehicle to stimulate muchneeded public discussion about the dimensions of and threats posed by world hunger the end of the commission did not end harry chapins commitment to ending hunger it was but a new beginning meeting with him on a number of occasions during this past year harry expressed his everpresent concern that congress and the administration commit itself to developing new hunger policies he continued to pound upon the doors of staid indifference to the global suffering and instability that hunger breeds i always had to listen very carefully when harry spoke because he could pack into 5 minutes more thoughtful innovative ideas than anyone i have known in a conversion he was a master at conceptually changing gears launching a fusillade of incisive questions comments and proposals on a variety of topics it was as if he were afraid he would not have the time to discuss and to do all those things that truly mattered to him there is an empty space now where once there was boundless energy and unfettered contagious enthusiasm calling for an end to world hunger harry once asked and if our future lies on the final line are we brave enough to see the signals and the signs resolving the complicated global problem of hunger will not be an easy task it will be that much more difficult with the absence of a prodding insistent force such as harry chapin but world hunger does place our future on the final line harry took the time to see the signals and the signs of an awesome menacing problem which if left to fester would visit an unprecedented catastrophe on us all he bravely confronted powerful institutional impediments to change and individuals revering the status quo he underscored the urgent need for courageous decisions if our nation were to act against hunger while the best opportunities for success still existed we greatly miss harry chapin our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to his wife sandy and their five children jamie jason jond jenny and josh during this grievous period but those of us who harry touched so deeply who remember the hopefilled strains of his songs who recall his unfailing commitment to others will not let harrys vision and dream be forgotten i urge my colleagues to find in the spirit of harry chapin

in support of the important resolution before us today it is imperative that the congress make clear that the american people stand united behind great britain in the tragic struggle developing over the falkland islands we all hoped that armed conflict could be avoided secretary haigs skillful and energetic effort to facilitate a peaceful settlement is to be commended that effort probably required a certain degree of evenhandedness now that argentine intransigence has made it clear that such an approach will not work the administrations decision to come out in full diplomatic support of britain is entirely appropriate the views of a distinguished member of the other body notwithstanding the notion that the united states had any real choice but to back great britain in this dispute is danger ously superficial regardless of the validity of competing claims of sovereignty argentina by seizing the islands by force has marked itself as the clear aggressor in this case the united states had no choice but to make it absolutely clear that the use of force to solve international territorial disputes will not be tolerated there are other profoundly important reasons for offering full diplomatic support to great britain in terms of right and wrong american foreign policy will seldom go aqtray if it is premised on support for the principle of nelfdetermination as john stuart mill once said one hardly knows what any division of the human race should be free to do if not to determine with which of the various collective bodies they choose to associate at issue in the falklands is not decolonialism bzut recolonialism the principle at stake is whether small numbers of people in small places in the world can determine their own destiny argentinas claims to sovereignty over the falklands are historical in nature dating most recently to 1833 these claims thus predate the entry of california to the union and carry dubious legal validity today the main test of international law to be applied on the sovereignty issue is not that of historicism but that of selfdeterminaticn it is the british who have assured the 1 800 people of the islands that through a plebiscite they may determine their own destiny it is the argentine military junta which through the use of force is denying this prospect finally strict considerations of national interest dictate that we support britain in this struggle solidarity in the western hemisphere is important but in a strategic sense it cannot be compared to the vital need for solidarity with the most steadfast member of nato our premier security alliance the aforementioned member of the other body in casting the sole vote against a resolution similar to the one we are now considering asserted that we have a vital need for the support of the argentine junta in preventing the spread of communist influence in central america this is hogwash that we must rely in any significant way upon military dictatorships of the type now in power in argentina to help preserve democracy in el salvador or elsewhere shows the bankruptcy of our policy in central america too often that policy seems to be premised upon the profoundly mistaken notion that it is possible to fight communist totalitarianism with equally despotic regimes of another stripe it would be tragic if a dispute in a remote corner of the south atlantic provoked by a corrupt regime with flagging domestic popularity should lead to severe strains in our most crucial collective security system embracing the north atlantic the longstanding bonds of mutual support that linked us in world war i and world war ii with britain simply cannot be jeopardized for a military government like that in power in argentina for all of these reasons it is profoundly important that we approve this resolution demonstrating solidarity with great britain the sanctions against argentina announced by the administration last friday coupled with offers of materiel support to britain should make it clear to argentinas leaders that rbfusal to withdraw their invasion forces from the falklands is a policy that will lead only to international isolation and bloodshed if the argentines nonetheless persist in their intransigence it may be necessary to consider going beyond the measures announced to date and to join great britain and her european and commonwealth allies by curtailing argentine exports to the united states economic sanctions are an imperfect response to political problems but solidarity with our allies may demand no less of us if this crisis continues if we cannot support our closest ally with minimal economic sanctions on an issue in which international law is so profoundly on britains side our european allies will inevitably ask whether we can be depended upon in a nato security context we all hope that further bloodshed can be averted if argentina persists in its present course however great britain deserves our full diplomatic support as called for in the resolution for reasons of right reasons of alliance and reasons of heritage we must be a united states behind a united kingdom finally issues of right and judgment aside there are certain lessons for our government and the world community in this conflict first much as it may be desirable it is not always possible to fence sit on important issues of the day even when choosing sides a nowin proposition in this case the prides and prestige of leaders in two governments are at stake and it is not inconceivable that after the initial outpouring of patriotic concerns the preparations to use force on both sides will inevitably lead to actions that may in the final measure prove to be liabilities for both governments internal support for both governments may be jeopardized and that two governments friendly to the united statesalbeit one a democracy and one a rightist military dictatorshipmay fall whether or not this occurs the liabilities of the falklands crisis to america are very great especially as they relate to our hemispheric relations it cannot be stressed enough that our peculiarly american heritage and relations with our neighbors to the south will and are being stretched to a profound degree because of our carefully considered tilt to great britain neverthless a probritish stance is the only appropriate position for america to take much as we might have preferred not to take a stand we have no choice except to do so as dante wrote the hottest circles of hell are reserved for those who in a time of imoral crisis maintain their neutrality second despite our preception that britains international legal position is sound there are concerns in america about the appropriateness of levels of response clearly there has seldom been a more unnecessary war and friends of britain and argentina urge today those tactics of restraint which hold the greatest prospect for a negotiated settlement here the oftquoted advice of the british military strategist liddell hart is relevant keep strong if possible in any case keep cool have unlimited patience never corner an opponent and always assist him to save his face put yourself in his shoesso as to see things through his eyes avoid selfrighteousness like the devilnothing is so selfblinding third there are lessons for the united states and britain about a foreign policy disproportionately premised on arms sales ironically our closest ally is being opposed by weapons systems supplied to the argentine military by ourselves and by the british perhaps the world would be a safer place if foreign aid programs were more oriented to economic than arms assistance fourth the conflict over the falklands underlines the lack of adequate institutions available for conflict resolution in the world the u n in new york and the international court of justice in the hague would appear to be the logical places where differences between these two great countries should be brought yet neither of these institutions were prepared to act immediatelypartly because there was not a joint britishargentine desire to submit to neutral thirdparty arbitration partly because a number of countries in the world including the united states have been conducting a foreign policy having the effect of undercutting rather than building up respect for international

education in the food and agricultural sciences it is no secret why america leads the world in the production of food fiber and forest products the effort to put our country in that leadership role began as far back as 1862 when our government entered into a longstanding commitment to endorse and support public expenditures at state landgrant colleges and universities for agricultural research and education programs for the extension of technical knowledge from the science laboratories to the user farmers and ranchers of this nation this effort also included as well programs that enhanced the living conditions and standards for farm and rural people and people throughout our country this commitment reached its climax in 1939 when approximately 39 percent of all federal research and development funds were allocated to agricultural research and education unfortunately by 1975 funds for agricultural research and education had sunk to approximately 2 percent of the federal r d budget fortunately for the american farmer and consumer these earlier efforts paid such rich dividends that our nation gained the capability to produce a cornucopia of food fiber and forest products far outstripping the capabilities of our competitors moreover our agriculture industry with only about 3 percent of the nations labor force as farmers produces such an abundance of food and fvber that our own people enjoy the best quality diet purchased with a smaller percent of disposable income of any people in the world in the history of man this remarkable feat has been made possible through extensive technological developments adopted by our farm producers and processors these developments and adoptions have as their basis the research and educational institutions our landgrant colleges and the 1890 institutions across the nation agriculture is one bright spot for america in the world marketplace while our nation is blessed with natural resources necessary for extensive agricultural production as well as a favorable climate in much of the nation the might and importance of the industry are dependent on other factors primarily past technological development we must continue to develop new technology if we are to maintain our world market position two decades ago most americans held the notion that products made in japan were cheap handmade trinkets with little durability what a change has taken placel where in the world will similar changes take place to enable farm producers to outcompete american producers only if we maintain a commitment to those factors that have enabled the american agricultural industry to grow in magnitude and importance will we maintain our ability to sell significant amounts of our production to the world and pay for the vast qualities of raw products we must import from other nations to fuel and feed our own industries and provide jobs for american labor and only by selling to the world market can we share in meeting the needs of hungry undernourished people of the world it is known that the worldwide demand for food and fiber will increase throughout tile rest of this century it is anticipated that people of the world will seek a better quality diet which will include more animal products in other areas of the world there have been examples of dramatic improvements in agricultural production india long riddled with famine is now producing enough wheat to meet most of its domestic needs this is a direct result of unitedstates wheat research advanced by normand borlaug at cimmyt in mexico and subsequently adapted in india similarly rice production in asia has significantly increased as a result of research at the international rice research institute in the philippines we in this nation have experienced approximatey a twofold increase in crop yields since 1940 largely a result of technology initiated over a century ago we know that there are substantial dividends for investments in technological developments in tuture agricultural production some have said that the importance of agriculture is equal to if not greater than that of our national defense system in regards to maintaining a strong competitive agriculture the soviet union and peoples republic of china are placing the highest priority on food production research with emphasis not only on output but on stable production from year to year we feel that the future of america can be no better than the future of the agricultural industry it is within the national interest to provide public support for agricultural research and education while we know there will be demand for farm products we should not take for granted the possibility that american agriculture will fill that demand without competition in most recent years productivity on american farms has been plateauing some of the reasons for this plateauing are soil erosion reduced soil organic matter soil compaction chemical residues more less productive land in production increased pressure on prime land for nonfarm uses fewer options for water fertilizer and pesticides increased regulatory constraints and decreased support for agricultural research and extension in real dollars this plateauing is not the result of not having any remaining potential to realize from continued research and education while approximately half of the agricultural reseach in the united states is funded with private funds we do not feel the nation should rely more heavily on this funding source furthermore many necessary projects would never be undertaken were we to rely on private initiative funding of food and agricultural research involves the expense of having things ready to go when research is required being prepared demands maintenance and replacement of research tools flocks herds barns feed milking parlors machinery field stations land orchards crops irrigation equipment and greenhouses we see a need for consistent formula funding of the hatch act as these funds are the basis for maintaining research systems benefits to farmers from research which reduces the cost of producing food fiber and forest products spill across county and state lines when we develop improved technology early acceptors and implementors benefit but in the long run the true benefactor is the american consumer research benefits everyone in the supermarkets therefore it is appropriate to maintain significant federal funding federal funds provide an element of federal influence this influence is in the form of coordination of efforts and results in minimizing duplications federal involvement also provides for upward and outward movement of information the usda science and education agenciesars csrs and extensionare examples of effective federal agencies further csrs and extension which manage federal state partnership research and education programs are federal agencies with relatively limited staffs that provide valuable coordination points for these programs the next generation of researchers and teachers and demonstrators have some exciting opportunities the results of their efforts can be even more dramatic than the results of the past researchers can keep american agriculture great with greater photosyn thetic efficiency improved biological nitrogen fixation genetic improvement and cell fusion techniques great er resistance to competing biological systems more efficiency in nutrient uptake and conversion reduction in losses from nitrification and denitrification greater resistance to environmental stresses and identification of hormonal systems and mechanisms to mention but a few areas chemically synthesized nitrogen fertilizer represents the largest single industrial input into agricultural production onethird of the fossile fuel energy consumed in food production is for this use each pound of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer requires an input of 30 cubic feet of natural gas when applied to the land much of this fertilizer can be lost to leaching by rain or to volitalization to the air the amount lost will depend on variance in the weather consider the significance of research that could result in a crop such as corn fixing nitrogen from the air solar energy is clean renewable and nonpolluting agriculture is the only major industry that directly depends on solar energy we farm the sun plants are literally biological sun traps and we ought to invest more of our resources to learn more about this magical process we recognize and agree with the need to reduce government spending we also recognize the dramatic returns available from investments in agricultural research and education we are convinced that the commitment should be increased and that the federal partner must participate in the increases we hope that the future will have increases even more extensive than those proposed by the administration in this years budget i am proud to report that the president and the secretary of agriculture are both in full support of the need for maintaining our leadership role in american agriculture now and into the future in this regard is is important to note that the only element of the fiscal year 1983 agriculture budget that received an increase was the research and education program moreover i havd been informed by secretary block himself that an outstanding scientist and leader in american agriculture for the position of assistant secretary of agriculture for research and education has been recommended to the president for nomination to the senate for confirmation further committing this administration to a strong agricultural research and education program to maintain and enhance our future role as the leader of the world in food fiber and

in this chamber some of my thoughts concerning the budget substitutes before us and relate these observations to our country and the needs of the ninth congressional district in new jersey while i agree with the president that the federal deficit must be lowered that we must reduce the tax burden and that we should move in the direction of smaller government i deeply feel that many of the proposals contained within the latta budget as revised from 2 weeks ago will accomplish these goals at the expense of the northeast i have supported the president in the past but believe that many aspects of his budget and the latta substitute are this year detrimental to the essential needs of new jersey and the entire northeastern region president reagans february budget which is before us today as the vehicle through which consideration of the budget alternatives will proceed was meant to be the next step in the administrations program to reduce federal spending cut taxes and provide for certain necessary increases in defense expenditures the president stated publicly that if his budget were fully enacted into law our federal deficit would be held to 91 5 billion in fiscal year 1983 and would decline step dily in the years to follow while the president had the best of intentions it was widely recognized by economists and business leaders that the adoption of the administration budget would lead to unacceptably high deficits the fact of the matter is that if the presidents budget were to be fully enacted by this body our federal deficit would be 132 4 billion for fiscal year 1983 according to the congressional budget office this is unacceptable even by the presidents own standard for reducing the federal deficit financial leaders have argued that the large budget deficitswith the prospect of even higher budget deficits to come in the futurewould create servere pressures in the nations credit markets keeping interest rates at unfortunately high levels and thereby preventing recovery from the current recession of the two budget alternatives befare us this afternoon both are relatively close in terms of the projected deficit in fiscal year 1983 the latta substitute calls for a deficit which is 8 2 billion lower than the jones substitute however by fiscal year 1985 this situation has been reversed with the jones deficit lower than the latta deficit by 11 7 billion in terms of cumulative deficits over 3 years jones is clearly less than latta deficits previouly approved by the senate are higher than those of either house proposal throughout this period while the deficits resulting from the presidents proposals are the highest of all under the administrations proposal before us today medicaid cuts total 57 million for new jersey of this amount approximately 4 million would be taken from residents of new jerseys ninth congressional district food stamp cuts would be 66 million from new jersey recipients and particularly hit hard familes of the working poor 32 000 recipients who try to work would lose eligibility or have benefits severely reduced welfare afdc cuts totaling 47 million in new jersey would tighten eligibility still further the presidents budget states that our basic welfare standard is to help the poor work their way out of need rather than fostering dependence on government assistance the administrations budget proposals however would simply continue those policies initiated last year which in fact eliminated most incentives to encourage the poor to seek and hold jobs these policies are a direct consequence of the administrations view that welfare should serve the extreme poor it was bad policy last year to achieve much of the welfare savings at the expense of the working poor it is surely misguided to make deeper cuts this year supplementing the marginal incomes of the working poor is a legitimate and necessary part of a sensible welfare policy neither new jersey nor the nation can afford a set of welfare programs which drive the poor out of the work force i now in place of the initial proposal the house republican leadership compromise being offered by mr latra places even further unacceptable cuts on entitlement programs as a matter of fact i understand that the new latta proposal more than doubles the cuts in basic benefit programs for the poor over what they were in the original latta proposal proponents of the new latta package claim that such large savings will come from reform of the medicare medicaid reimbursement systems for hospitals and physicians however in the absence of comprehensive acrosstheboard reforms these cuts will be shifted to medicare medicald beneficiaries and private pay patients i believe that cuts of this nature will undoubtably require the nations elderly to pay huge new outofpocket costs for medical care i feel that requiring such cuts fails to rcognize that the elderlys outofpocket costs for medicare increased as a result of last jears cuts i do not believe that such a cut can be justified when medicare now pays only 38 to 44 percent of older persons total health care costs the latta substitute represents a loss of at least 2 1 billion in housing for the state of new jersey during the next 3 fiscal years section 8 subsidies would be reduced so that 106 planned housing units for senior citizens in hackensack n j could no longer be afforded statewide it is my understanding that 1 715 dwelling units intended for both families and senior citizens could not be constructed i find these cutbacks under the revised latta proposal to be just as unacceptable as i found them in the original proposal voted down by the house 2 weeks ago i cannot bring myself to support cuts of this nature when funding is being directed instead to an already bloated defense budget which i addressed in the amendment i introduced to the jones the proponents of the revised latta package have claimed that education is provided as an addon over fiscal year 1982 levels this assertion ignores several fundamental facts that seem to me to add to education cuts in the latta package i direct the attention of my colleagues to the fact that 700 million in deferrals are not included in the fiscal year 1983 function 500 baseline thus lowering the base to which the additions are made latta reduces funding for the guaranteed student loan program latta reduces needbased student aid programs and reduces funding for scientific research this will detrimentally affect the national science foundation nasa ani space research with tuition costs increasing as federal support programs decrease we face the very real danger of sacrificing the most important investment in our futureeducational opportunity for our citizensin the name of shortterm budget savings the latta energy budget represents a revised 1 4 billion reduction below fiscal year 1982 program levels under these provisions i am afraid congress will be taking additional steps to abandon its attempt to establish a national energy policy that pursues a balanced and broad based range of energy programs relieving our dependence on foreign oil is vital to our nations economic recovery and the deep cuts or total elimination of many conservation and renewable energy programs will not serve to foster unitedstates energy independence the revised latta package reduces the natural resources and environment function by 400 million below fiscal year 1982 levels at a time when the environmental protection agencys responsibilities are increasing the resources allocated under latta for the achievement of its tasks will be inadequate i believe that the environmental laws which protect the health of the american public and maintapn the quality of our natural environment should not be abrogated through the budget process by this congres in a time of increasing environmental concern we must address the problems of hazardous waste disposal and provide the necessary funding for the environmental protection agency in summary the revised latta proposal before the congress this afternoon reduces the deficit by making drastic cuts in entitlement programs designed to help the poor outlay reductions below current services levels would be directed at medicare medicaid food stamps afdc child nutrition guaranteed student loans and supplemental security income while nondefense discretionary programs will be frozen at fiscal year 1982 levels latta proposes reductions in the following discretionary programs employment and training transportation energy postal service space and science subsidized housing health programs education legal services and small business loans the jones budget alternative shows that we do not have to severely reduce entitlement and discretionary programs in order to reduce our federal deficit however it does not measure up in its treatment of defense spending as well it raises taxes in an unacceptable amount without greatly decreasing the deficit i cannot support it i cannot support latta e"], [0.5384077429771423, 0.5384077429771423, 0, "all of us are interested in how we can restore economic growth in our economy and my topic this afternoon will deal with how we can cut down the deficit for 1983 and indeed create a balanced budget for fiscal year 1983 beginning on october 1 primarily let me observe that today 928 000 workers in the construction industry are out of work that is 18 1 percent of the total in that industry two hundred and fifty thousand of the workers in the automobile industry are out of work that is 20 8 percent of the workers in that industry these two industries together total 1 178 000 workers who are out of work because of a decline in their industries the principal question is why in the opinion of this member from california the reason or the answer to that question is highinterest rates currently the prime in this country is about 16 percent how do we get that prime rate down the answer is that we must reduce the quantity of borrowing which the federal government contemplates taking from the credit markets over the course of the next year how do we do that we have got to reduce the size of the deficit now when you serve in this house in this institution it almost exudes from the walls that you really cannot cut spending of the federal government that it is part and parcel of the premises and it is impossible to really do it well this member from california yesterday made a presentation to the budget committee whereby a plan was presented that we could balance the budget in 1983 i would like to talk about that this afternoon as we prepare to do battle over the budget this year as we have done in the past i am sure that all of us are not just a little more uneasy this time about the budgetary socioeconomic financial and political ramifications of being confronted with the largest deficit in our nations history we are simply not following the script very well which if we recall why our constituents sent us here 18 months ago calls for movement in the opposite direction we are supposed to be balancing the budget not busting it it becomes imperative therefore for us to find an alternative to the administrations fiscal year 1983 budget a chief obstacle which has thus far prevented us from coalescing around an acceptable substitute is the continuing debate over economic assumptions in february the office of management and budget indicated that the fiscal year 1983 deficit would be 107 2 billionincluding offbudget itemsthe congressional budget office estimates the onbudget deficit alone will be closer to 157 billion the variation in just the onbudget deficit exceeds 70 percent due to acceptance of differing assumptions as to gnp growth inflation interest rates unemployment and changes in law with fluctuations of as little as 1 percent accounting for billions of dollars in changes to the budget it becomes nearly impossible for us to correctly predict what the final figures will be because of this uncertainty it becomes even more important for the congress to take decisive action on the budget and reduce the projected deficitwhether 100 billion or 200 billionby an amount large enough and meaningful enough to make a critical difference large enough to relieve much of the constrictive pressure on the credit markets and meaningful enough so that the message to both taxpayers and the business community would be clear as to our intention to finally do something about outofcontrol federal spending i submit therefore that despite protestations to the contrary not only must the budget be balanced it can be or to be more exactbecause of continued volatility of economic assumptionsas closely balanced as possible under existing circumstances this can be accomplished by cutting 110 billion from the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit whatever that figure may ultimately be a cut of this magnitude would certainly be large enough to materially affect financial markets and meaningful enough to send a clear message that we are finally serious about putting the nations fiscal house in order my program for reducing the deficit by 110 billion can be divided into two underlying premises seven direct components and two indirect additives as follows premises first measures undertaken to reduce the fiscal year 1983 budget should encompass the final 6 months of fiscal year 1982 as well such measures as freezing current benefit levels scaledback increases selective cuts rescissions deferrals or eliminations ought to be implemented as soon as possible inasmuch as fiscal year 1982 spending is not only excessive to begin with but alsobecause of its exaggerated deficithas contributed significantly to the fluctuating and undermining economic indicators after all the more pessimistic analyses including the congressional budget offices result from the higher deficits interest rates and unemployment and lower productivity and revenues caused by the fiscal year 1982 budget i believe that by attacking the fiscal year 1982 deficit at least partially we will affect the economic indicators in such a way as to make the administrations original forecasts and assumptions more feasible and acceptable and even though it may be too late to reduce actual spending for this yearfiscal year 1982in many programs budget cuts based upon fiscal year 1982 levels of spending ought to be possible in most cases this is especially important for two reasons fiscal year 1983 spending is largely an extension of fiscal year 1982as well as previousspending and larger cuts are possible in the more egregiouslyinflated fiscal year 1982 budget than in its fiscal year 1983 successor witness the increase from fiscal year 1981 to fiscal year 1982 of 67 billionomb estimatesin totl outlays as opposed to only a 28 billion increase from fiscal year 1982

our country from a gardenvariety member who has the vanity to profess some knowledge in the field i received an army commission by completing the rotc course at kansas state university in 1938 i served in the army for 5 years in world war ii i was a member of the arizona national guard and army reserve prior to and for some years after my election to the congress i have a certificate of completion of the associate course of the armys command and general staff college i am now a retired colonel in the judge advocate generals corps more important i served for almost 5 years as a member of the defense subcommittee of the house appropriations committee later as minority leader of the house i was an ex officio member of the house intelligence committee i have a lasting personal interest in the field of geopolitics and in global strategy i have always classified myself as a hawk where matters of defense are concerned i feel that the communist world is absolutely serious in its intent to master the whole globe whenever it can do so it continues to probe where it can find weaknesses and if and when the ultimate weakness appears i have no doubt that it will move to take advantage of that situation as rapidly and effectively as possible yet i feel that our defense posture needs constant examination and reexamination right now is a period in our history when such reexamination is long overdue not only have we fallen behind the russians in some very important categories of armaments but our economic and fiscal situations are worrisome to say the least thus we have two problems first rearmament to deter effectively any attack and second rearming at a price our economy can support not easy the defense of the country must be a part of foreign policy and the framers of foreign policy must be constantly aware of our defense strengths and weaknesses too often persons in control of both our defense and foreign policies are individuals who have only superficial knowledge in the field or who have gathered their knowledge from having served in similar capacities in the past and are therefore guided by the methods and ideas of the past not since richard nixon have we had a president who really had a personal understanding of foreign policy not since dwight eisenhower have we had a president with a personal understanding of our defense needs and capabilities unfortunately the result has been a failure to develop our foreign policy and our defense strategy along the lines which would utilize the strength of america instead of building on our strength we have reacted to the initiatives both in diplomacy and in milltary developments of other nations too often ours has been a policy of response not innovation naturally other nations choose to center their activities in areas in which they are strong and we are weak as a result we are in effect playing in their ball park and by their rules not ours soviet russias great strength is the availability of huge quantities of manpower which hang like the sword of damocles over all of western europe the russian soldier can be inducted trained and maintained for a much smaller outlay of goods and services than can his american counterpart the russian soldier is used to the soviet society and economy a system in which ambitions are stultified by the limitation of opportunity on the other hand the american soldier eventually wants to get back into civilian life make some money provide security for himself and his family lead the good life and if he is very ambitious perhaps go to congress some day the result is that there is no way that the united states can except in an allout war situation compete with the russians in volume of manpower our military has problems in competing with the blandishnents of civilian lifetheirs does not so in preparation for war or in acting to deter it we should not rely on superiority in manpower we do not have it so where do we go you would think that a nation with the advanced technology and industrial capabilities which the united states possesses would be able to offset this manpower gap by the production and use of better and more sophisticated weapons but something is terribly wrong with the manner in which we utilize our economic power for military purposes for instance we seem to be incapable of building a tank which is the equal in firepower durability and maneuverability with those of other nations when i was on the defense subcommittee of the appropriations committee we finally had to give up on building the main battle tank mbt 70 i suggested to the then secretary of the army that it should not be too long before we could take the expertise that we had acquired from that abortive attempt and develop another tank he calmly told me that it would take 10 years to develop another tank i was never able to find out why this was so but obviously it was something must be wrong with the manner in which the pentagon sets about to develop a new tank and produce it and of course this is just one example we could go into many other areas such as attack helicopters in which we should excel and do not it is true that much of what we buy for the military is new and certainly is not for sale at any hardware store therefore cost overruns can be expected but i am bothered by the apparently widespread practice by defense cohtractors of making deliberately low estimates on the cost of new weapons systems the name of the game is to get the contract at any price get the military committed to you then raise the price the result is horrendous cost overruns there have to be better procurement methods than those we now use in other words eisenhower was ob viously right when he said that the military industrial complex needed to be watched it does and it is not being watched to the point that it must be in the future this adds up to a major defect in our military posturein our ability to build the best defense our economy can produce and can afford it must be remedied so why is it so necessary that we have a superior tank anyway we certainly need tanks to defend our own country and our own hemisphere but the main reason that we now need tanks is to blunt any armored attack by the russians across the north german plain our foreign policy and our defense policy are largely geared to defending western europe from a soviet attack we have some 350 000 american troops permanently stationed in germany for the purpose of containing such an attack until the total strength of nato can be mobilized to defeat the attack and hurl it back as a nation we have been preoccupied with western europe ever since world war i before world war i western europe was the undoubted master of the world through their co lonial systems the nations of western europe including england controlled most of the globe the industrial and technological might of western europe exceeded that of all the other nations of the world obviously if any one nation had been able to obtain hegemony over all of western europe that nation could have become the undisputed master of this globe the objective of our foreign policy was at that time and has been ever since to keep any nation or combination of nations from acquiring that hegemony but the situation today is entirely different the power of europe is infinitesimal compared to the dominant position which it occupied prior to world war i its colonial system is gone and while its scientific and technological capabilities are indeed formidable they are not in the dominant position which they ocupied in the early part of the century yet we continue to base much of our foreign policy and our military planning on the needs and wants of the nations of western europe i think it is becoming increasingly apparent that this policy needs to be reexamined keeping 350 000 troops in europe and keeping our total force ready to operate in a european war is obviously a real drain on our eonomy it is true that some european nations bear part of the expensesometimes grudgingly yet when we try to defend europe at less cost in assets and manpower we usually are met by firm opposition for instance president carter tried to get the agreement of the nations of europe to deploy a neutron bomb this weapons system if in place would be the most effective deterrent of all to a massed land attack by the unitedstatess r much better than any numer of allied tanks the neutron bomb could destroy soviet tanks and personnel without doing significant or lasting damage to the cities and populations of our allies in western europe it is ideal for the purpose of deterrence yet most of the governments of western europe will have no part of its deployment other than economically why was it necessary for us to have thi weapon a brief look at the map of europe should answer that question practically all of the american troops in europe are located in central and southern germany in the early days of the nato alliance these troops were supplied by supply lines across france from the french atlantic ports when de gaulle decided to in effect pull out of nato it became necessary for new supply lines to be established those lines run to the belgian dutch and german ports on the north sea thus supplies for american troops must cross the north german plain which of course is the most likely avenue of attack by the massed russian armies in a very few hours these supply lines could be interdicted and the american troops in germany could either be prisoners of war hostages or engaged in fighting desperately to maintain a defense perimeter without the requisite supplies of ammunition equipment and reinforcements an alliance which is truly reciprocal will last but one which is not has numbered days the refusal of the nato allies to allow deployment of the neutr n bomb certainly did not indicate any concern for the obviously exposed position of american troops in germany nor for the continued drain on the american economy is concern a oneway street in nato also i think we were all disappointed by the fact that the nations of western europe were so lukewarm in their support of our efforts to free the american hostages from our embassy in tehran i think it is also interesting that there is no plan for europe to take any part in the massive undertaking to defend the areas of the persian gulf from which comes most of the oil for europe in fact the nato nations have steadfastly refused to move outside of europe in effect leaving the rest of the free world for us to defend we even see some of our allies actively aiding rebels in central america against governments which have our backing if linkage is to be applied to our relatons with the unitedstatess r and it should be perhaps the same principle should apply to the actions or lack of action of our allies in various parts of the world i do not believe the nations of europe are adopting the policies which they now pursue because they do not like the united states they are doing so because they perceive their own best interests to be in a closer rapprochement and detente with eastern europe than we seem to want here is evidence they are perfectly willing to trust the future of much of their energy supplies to a gas pipeline from siberia which russia could cut off at a moments notice the energy supplied through this pipeline could be used by the russians to blackmail western europe western europes reactions to the invasion of afghanistan and to the polish situation have been measured to put it mildly it does seem possible that there is a conscious or unconscious policy in western europe to downgrade down play and perhaps eventually do away with american involvement in the affairs of that continent that might not be all bad in fact i think we should all consider the possibility that the relevance of the atlantic alliance is no longer as apparent as it used to be and that in our selfinterest and in theirs we should cease to center our foreign policy on western europe now let us turn to the middle east the obligations which we have to the state of israel are being fulfilled we can all wish that israel would realize that its best chance of ultimate survival is to have a tranquil peaceful middle east and that they would be more cooperative in working toward that end nevertheless the survival of israel and its capability to defend itself is very important to the united states and its people and will continue to be but speaking purely from selfinter est the middle easts oil reserves are the prime reasons for such intense american activity in that region today 30 9 percent of the worlds oil comes from the middle east and 55 8 percent of the known reserves of oil are in that area it is easy to see why people are preoccupied with keeping that oil available because unfortunately we are still in the oil age and probably will be for quite some time and yet when you consider the miles of ocean or air involved in our transporting and maintaining enough force to defend the persian gulf one must realize that defending it absolutely against a determined wellequipped locally based enemy is practically impossible nuclear weapons would be out of the question except in some tactical situations we could provide sufficient force to make it expensive for any enemy to conquer that part of the world but if the russians for instance persisted our prospects for ultimate victory are indeed small furthermore the danger of triggering world war iii is always present then nobody wins and everybody loses yet we are building a conventional rapid strike force at the expense of bilions of dollars the main purpose being for deployment in the area of the persian gulf i suggest that this defense buildup and the foreign policy which it seeks to implement are costing defense dollars which could be used better in other ways all right now where are we i have indicted willingness to withdraw our troops from europe i have also said that i would cut the rapid deployment force drastically i would tailor it for use only in the western hemisphere or perhaps in some of the nations of western africa now let me suggest another cut in defense i would not deploy the mx missile in anything resembling a racetrack i think the missile should be developed and some should be deployed however we should put them in superstrong silos and provide point defense systems i am not talking about deploying hundreds of mxs i am talking about deploying only a few whose survivability would be assured long enough to fire them at least for the present i would keep the minutemen which we now have deployed in order to make it very difficult for the russians to defeat spot defense systems by oversaturation deploying the mx in this manner would in my opinion save billions of dollars and accomplish the deterrence which we desire as well as the deployment of many hundreds would i would certainly continue to build and deploy the trident submarine and its very sophisticated missile system another saving i would make is to cease building the b1 bomber i once was a leading advocate of the b1 that was before the stealth concept came into the picture now i think we should go all out to develop stealth we will have a better more modern plane which the russians will have to match or find a way to defeat also the money spent on stealth in the next few critical budgetary years will be significantly less than the cash outlays for the b1 i am well aware of the problems of stealth but i have great confidence that they will be solved i am also aware that not building b1 may result in a defense gap in the middle and late 1980s personally i will take a chance on that i believe our deterrent even without b1 is sufficient the savings will cut the deficit or will allow us to mitigate some of the deep cuts made in funds for higher education now you are saying it looks like this guy is advocating unilateral disarmament nothing could be farther from the truth i said earlier that our defense systems are not geared to take advantage of the strengths of america but only to respond to the strengths of russia the strength of america is in our scientific and technological capabilities we have the capability now of putting satellites in orbit which would be able to defend themselves either with conventional weapons or beams and which would also have the capability of killing hostile intercontinental ballistic missiles before they can reach the point of reentry into the atmosphere eventually this capability would extend to destroying such missiles almost immediately after launch we can develop the technology to do this and it seems obvious to me that using that technology would be far better than building new missiles every time the russians do doing this we would truly be building a defensive system not an offensive one aimed at mass destruction the day of the mutually assured destruction theory of defense should be ended now it can be i am well aware that such a system would take some years to develop and deploy for that reason i would certainly keep most of the present systems which we have now for deterrence in good working order and well manned but there must come a time when we can say to the russians we can zap your missiles any time we want so let us each destroy our missiles and build no more operations in space are now being downgraded they should not be i am not a newcomer to the ranks of those who believe that the development of our capabilities in space is important not only to our civilian economy but to our defense i was on the independent offices subcommittee of the house appropriations committee when we committed the great acts of faith which resulted in funding manned space flight served to encourage and develop the various planetary probes which nasa has accomplished so brilliantly and redalted in the capability to produce reusable manned space vehicles such as the columbia to me with what military training i possess space represents a flank the high ground which we must occupy if we do not others will to our detriment we can do it we should do it and doing it will give us great benefits in the future one of those benefits is to develop sources of energy which would lessen considerably if not end our dependence on middle eastern oil and the consequent strains and distortions it causes in our economy and in our foreign policy the suns energy is there for the taking with the flights of the columbia and the attendant capability to produce satellites in orbit we can use suns rays with a photovoltaic array and produce huge amounts of electric power i am well aware of the environmentalproblems which production of that much power and its transfer through the atmosphere might cause i just happen to believe that the chances of success in developing power which could be made available anywhere in the world cheaply is so great that we would find ways to overcome whatever disadvantages might be inherent i am most unhappy with those portions of the reagan budget which have reduced governmental investment in research and development not only in solar energy but in fusion of the hydrogen atom and its isotopes we should be working contemporaneously on solar energy and fusion to the very limit of our capabilities not only would development of power from these sources be the means of deflecting the thrust of our defense dollars and our foreign policy away from the middle east and the persian gulf but it would be the means of providing the underdeveloped world with the wherewithal to work toward better lives for their people energy plus technology plus raw materials plus a good labor supply plus good management can make an industrialized nation out of an underdeveloped one in just a few years to sum up i would make the following changes to provide first a better defense second a sounder foreign policy not dependent on access to oil third a chance to build a peaceful affluent world population and fourth significant savings to our government which will help lower deficits cut the interest rate and provide a sound base for economic recovery first i would like our troops out of europe after consultation and hopefully i trust agreement with the nations of western europe second i would cut the mx program by at least 70 percent third i would abandon the b1 and proceed to perfect the stealth manned bomber fourth i would cut the rapid deployment force and change its mission to operate mainly in the western hemisphere fifth i would build a strategic defensive system in space and eventually would dismantle all ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads if other nations did the same and sixth i would proceed to build a consortium of interested nations to construct satellites in space to produce cheap electric energy for all and proceed full speed to develop electric energy from fusion of the hydrogen atom now i hope you realize that i know that all of these things cannot be accomplished overnight in fact i am probably talking about some things which should be accomplished within the next 50 years we must have a peaceful world or as admiral rickover said we will destroy ourselves for the next several years we will have to continue to rely on deterrence of aggressors but after that period of time we should have the most sophisticated defensive systems in the world in earth orbit and we should by then have been able to recruit most of the nations in the world in a mutual undertaking to provide cheap energy so that all the peoples of the globe can share in its wealth and its affluence this is the new frontier in years past when populations became restive and people got bored there was always new land to be utilized and put to the plow this is the new land and american science and technology are the plows which we must use to create a peaceful better world for all of humanity the time to put our hands to that plow and begin the task is now"],

tool it is impotent to do the job that is designed to do as a former chief counsel of the economic development administration i probably have as much or more experience as anybody in this house in trying to use a public works program as a countercyclical tool i will tell my colleagues it just does not work it will not work to solve the infrastructure problem which is immense and growing and it certainly is not going to work to solve the unemployment problem which is also immense and growing in trying to couple these two together i think we do a disservice i think it is hypocritical to suggest that a quickfix hurryup jobs program is in any way going to address the structural unemployment problem in this country the lpw program which i was involved in trying to administer 6 years ago was designed to try to resolve the recession of 197576 the money did not come on stream until 1977 and 1978 in fact today we are still spending money out of that local public works program of 6 years

in a reasonable time i tell you that the cost per job is outrageous the gao has done a study that shows that in the local public works programs the average cost per job was about 65 000 per job that sure is not cost effective in my book there has been much discussion on this floor recently as to what direction our nation should take to achieve the long sought after goal of economic recovery helping the over 12 million americans currently out of work must be a matter of the highest priority to this body but by help i do not mean the type of shortterm makework public works jobs programs that reportedly are being considered we owe it to those of our citizens who cannot find work to create a stable and healthy economy so that the jobs they do find will be permanent jobsjobs with a future this cannot be accomplished by a multibilliondollar countercyclical boondoggle it is the height of hypocrisy in my opinion to suggest that putting 400 000 or 600 000 or even a million people to work for 15 weeks or so is an answer to the unemployment of over 12 million that is political cynicism at its worst more than that it is bad economics because it is very likely to fuel the inflation that we have struggled so hard to bring under control experience with the local public works act of 1976 shows us the flaws in this approach the overall effect of programs of this type is relatively small the impact of the program comes too late to have any meaningful effect and in fact has an adverse effect because of the inflationary pressure created in the rush to use available grant money projects of relatively low priority to the community are frequently funded and the direct cost of each created job is outrageously high to quote from a study commissioned by eda and prepared by chase

expertise in this area is on private sector involvement in the economic development process it recognize that without this involvement no meaningful economic recovery can take place the key to recovery lies in long term private sector jobs rather than temporary federally subsidized ones and federal resources should be dedicated to stimulating this kind of longterm growth rather than wasted on quick fix gimmicks that in the end only make things worse currently this legislation awaits the call to conference by the senate while in these waning days of this session the possiblity of that conference occurring is slight i am encouraged by my colleagues in the other body that next session will bring further dialog and more thorough consideration of this valuable component to a national economic recovery program the final element of the package that i would offer is the speedy consideration of the presidents enterprise zone legislation the community which lacks the economic and physical base to support industry must be reached by an effective economic de velopment program the enterprise zone concept is a highly targeted method of providing the distressed community with the type of assistance that will enable it to attract private investment and move in the direction of selfsufficiency working in conjunetion with the national development investment act enterprise zone legislation would benefit the most highly distressed areas of the nation both rural and urban and is a necessary component to meaningful national economic development we must face the realization that public works jobs programs simply do not work we must reject the arguments that will be made to return us to the folly of the federal government buying jobs for our unemployed to quote an editorial from the new york times nothing would be more hollow than to lunge for a quick jobs package that produces little new employment and more inflation the rebuilding of americas infrastructure combined with a responsible federal spending policy will in turn generate the meaningful employment opportunities we are all seeking that approach will build the necessary economic base on which industry will

investment in clinch river cannot be justified let us look for a moment at what this project costs and what we can expect to get out of it in my view it is extremely important that the federal government continue to play a role in energy our criteria for policy choices should include whether an investment will ease our dependence on foreign oil in an environmentally sound manner at an acceptable cost the clinch river breeder reactor meets none of these conditions first of all even the department of energys blueribbon energy research advisory board has ranked crbr as a low priority item its 1981 report federal energy r d priorities stated that the construction of a breeder reactor demonstration at this time is not an urgent priority and thus under current budget constraints erab recommends that such demonstration be delayed until a future time recent trends in energy use have clearly indicated that the crbr is not necessary as a replacement for light water reactors or to lessen our dependence on foreign oil unitedstates oil demand is largely for transportation and other liquid fuels such as home heating oil only 7 percent of the oil we use in this country generates electricity furthermore annual electrical growth rates of 7 percent during the 1960s have dropped to less than 3 percent even if our country is to meet this growth rate with light water reactors this would be less expensive than a breeder program recent studies have called into question whether a breeder will ever cost less than a conventional reactor due to plant cancellations and other factors uranium now costs about 23 per pound estimates as to the uranium price that would make a breeder competitive now range from 165 to 400 per pound and what will the ultimate cost of the crbr be if we continue to support it the original estimate in 1971 was 400 million a figure that was revised to 700 million a year later in 1977 the cost estimate jumped to 2 billion and the current figure even before ground is broken is 3 57 billion if frances first commercialscale breeder the super phoenix is any indication the cost could rise to over 6 billion most outrageous is that the taxpayers will foot almost the entire bill although the project wt 3 originally portrayed as an equal partnership between the government the nuclear industry and utilities the private share is frozen at 257 million at a time of fiscal austerity when programs that will truly contribute to our energy security are under attack further funding for clinch river is nothing short of foolish according to a study by the

set out an 8year program estimated to cost 794 million that would produce 800 megawatts of electricity from all types of wind machines compare this to spending at least 3 billion for about 400 megawatts from the clinch river project but how much have we appropriated for wind energy in fiscal year 1982 about 35 million when will the federal government realize what the american people already know the fastest and least expensive way to gain energy security is through conservation and the development of renewable energy technologies in ncw england we reduced our aepndnice on oil from 80 percent to 73 percent in 2 years by aggressively pursuing energy conservation and development of our indigenous renewable energy sources during that time nuclear powers contribution to our electrical

history last year the space science subcommittee as you have heard directed nasa and the defense department to conduct a joint study to determine our needs for a high energy upper stage this is that study upper stage alternatives for the shuttle era a nasadod report to congress we have had it for over a year the study concluded that nasa should begin developing a centaur for space shuttle use since the reports completion nothing significantly has changed to warrant deleting centaur from nasas budget in fact on page 81 of this report that we commissioned it specifically rejects the end effect of the flippo amendment namely an ius galileo combined mission fortunately the president accepted the urgent supplemental last july 18 and sustained the funding for the centaur high energy upper stage integration into the shuttle the presidents acceptance is consistent with nasas 1982 authorization and appropriation bills and recognizes the technical superiority of centaur as well as the fact that centaur integration obviates the need for an otherwise redundant 1 to 11 billion for an air force high energy stage program for military and intelligence uses which we will have need for in the 1987 timeframe i would like to briefly outline four compelling reasons why the house should support the nasa air force recommendations and reject the flippo amendment first ius cannot meet our high energy upper stage requirements for nasa dod and commercial missions beyond the 198586 timeframe our high priority space missions are increasingly finding weight to be a limiting factor the ius can currently lift only 5 000 pounds compared to the 10 000 to 14 000 pounds provided by centaur second the failure to move decisively now to develop a high energy upper stage for shuttle will result in an increasing loss of business to foreign competition specifically the french ariane the ariane vehicle will lift approximately 9 500 pounds to geosynchronous orbit by 198687 thus exceeding ius capabilities without centaur the united states will lose this commercial market third development of a new high energy upper stage coupled with the decision to fly galileo and the international solar polar mission with an ius will cost taxpayers at least 700 million to 800 million more than centaur take at least 2 years longer to complete and yield no significant performance improvement indeed it has been estimated that a brandnew stage as i say will cost between 1 and 1 billion and will basically involve reinventing the centaur fourth and finally launching galileo and solar polar on centaur has a number of critical advantages over using ius for these missions centaur would provide a flight time of 26 months for nasas galileo mission and would guarantee 11 satellite encounters compared to a flight time of more than double 54 months and 6 satellite encounters for an ius launch plus the increased risk of the increased time in the case of solar polar centaur restores the maximum possible mission as well as nasas credibility with its foreign partners most notably the european space agency it is very likely that another change in launch vehicles will cause our international friends to question our resolve and ultimately conclude that nasa is an unreliable partner such an attitude may devastate our future plans for cooperative space ventures of the solar system"],
