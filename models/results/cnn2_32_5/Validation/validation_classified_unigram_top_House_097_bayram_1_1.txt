since our committees worked very very hard on meeting the congressional mandates in terms of meeting the maximum budget requirements and as a result we are asked now to consider a substitute that the committees have not even seen i rise in opposition to the grammlatta amendments to the reconciliation proposal as it affects the recommendations of the committee on post office and civil service the committee was mandated by the first budget resolution to achieve spending reductions of over 5 billion within our area of jurisdiction this was one of the largest cuts required of any of the authorizing committees of the house the members of the post office and civil service committee considered many legislative changes that would have complied with the house mandate all but the handful contained in the committees reconciliation proposal were rejected for one reason or another our committee did not ask for these cutsthey were forced on the committee by the budget resolution however whether the house agrees or disagrees with the way the cuts were fashioned the committee fully complied with the mandate of the house in a prudent and responsible manner in fact we have actually exceeded our reconciliation instructions for fiscal year 1982 by over 100 million critics of the committees proposal complain that the cuts will hurt one group or another unfairly i agree and that is unfortunate i do not want to cut any ones benefits it seems to me the real issue today is not over the size of the cuts because the grammlatta substitute actually results in less overall outlay savings in fiscal years 1982 and 1983 the real issue today is whether the house will tell the authorizing committee not only how much to cut from its jurisdiction but specifically where to make the cuts the house budget act of 1974 was never intended to supplant the work of the authorizing committee and no member ever expected reconciliation to be used to second guess the expertise of the committees the committee on post office and civil service worked hard at adopting a package of spending cuts that spread the pain and suffering in as fair a manner as possible under very difficult circumstances the grammlatta substitute amendments would not cut one dime more from the budget than the committees proposal our recommendation is a delicate combination of cutsthey must stand together let me explain what the grammlatta substitute really does it reduces the present twiceayear costofliving allowance for 3 1 million civilian and military retirees to a onceayear adjustment it also reduces the october 1 1981 federal employees pay raise from the committees recommended 5 8 percent increase to a miserly 4 8 percent the money that would be cut from the annuities of retirees and the wages of federal workers under the grammlatta substitute would be used to continue the present system of double dipping by approximately 140 000 military retirees working for the federal government the remaining 50 million saved under the grammlatta substitute would also go to continue paying federal employees dual compensation when they are on active duty with a national guard or military reserve unitan entitlement incidentally that both president reagan and omb director david stockman oppose i also oppose cutting these programs but i am more adamantly opposed to cutting the twiceayear cola for 3 1 million federal retirees evidentally there is a misconception that federal retirees are better able than others to absorb these cuts let met set the record straight on that issue one out of four federal retirees must try to live on less than 500 a month40 percent of all federal retirees struggle to make ends meet but with 700 a month fully 75 percent of all the survivors of federal retirees receive less than 6 000 a year are these the people whose benefits grammlatta wants to cut i hope not i would like to remind my colleagues that candidate ronald reagan in october of last year made a solemn promise to federal retirees to keep the present system intact this is a commitment that has now been broken the house in 1976 eliminated a 1percent sweetener for retirees and substituted for that reduction in benefits the present twiceayear system i would hope the house would not also renege on that commitment proponents of these amendments say that federal retirees are overcompensated and that social security is indexed but once a year and this amendment will bring an overgenerous system into line with other programs i would strongly disagree with that and remind my colleagues that unlike social security a federal annuity is subject to federal and state income tax i would also point out the reconciliation bill already takes more than the proverbial pound of flesh from federal benefits just review with me for a moment what is happening this year that adversely affectsthe federal sector first the reconciliation bill cuts federal pay by 3 4 billion by imposing a 5 8 percent pay cap instead of the 13 5 percent required to keep our federal work force in line with the private sector incidentally this is the fourth straight year that a federal pay cap has been imposed in the years 1970 to 1980 federal white collar pay has trailed the private sector by 20 percent and is 35 percent behind the cpi for the same period certainly we should not cut a 5 8 percent pay raise any further president reagan has also imposed a massive reduction in force on the gov ernment that would eliminate over 100 000 federal jobs in 1981 and 1982 the senate rceunciliation bill contains a proposal that would shift almost 1 billion in health care costs from the medicare program to the federal employees health benefits program according to the office of personnel management and the health carriers this will result in premium increases of up to 100 percent for federal retirees and could actually destroy the program i say enough is enough the congress and the administration should stop dumping on the federal worker and retiree or the best run government in the world will be destroyed it is no coincidence that our country narrowly averted a disastrous air traffic controllers strike only this weeka strike threat created by frustration at continued pay caps and reductions in benefits if we continue down this road of singling out the federal worker and retiree for punitive treatment these strike threats will escalate and we can say goodbye to the peaceful and hhrmonious labor relations our country has long enjoyed with the federal work force in conclusion let me remind the house of what president franklin d roosevelt said during his presidency the fundamental purpose of government is to do the greatest good for the greatest number of people i am not happy with the committees cuts but we have done the best we could to protect the greatest number of people and i therefore urge the rejection of the grammlatta substitute"],

delegates to the interparliamentary union might report to the congress and to the american people the results of that rather auspicious and important conference as you know the spring meeting of the interparliamentary union was held this year in lagos nigeria from april 12 through 17 i was honored to have been appointed as one of the delegates by our speaker i want to express my appreciation to my fellow delegates the honorable claude pepper who headed the house delegation and senator robert stratford who headed the general delegation i also express my appreciation to my other compatriots representative robert mcclory and representative caldwell butler representative mcclory is a senior member of the illinois congressional delegation and has been a stalwart moving force behind unitedstates participation in the interparliamentary union i also wish to express appreciation to certain esteemed public servants like the honorable donald easum former ambassador to nigeria and the president of the africanamerican institute who was in strumental in giving me some tremenduusly excellent briefings also mrs clara ossinulu the nigerian representative of the africanamerican institute the honorable walter carrington director of the department of international affairs at howard university and former unitedstates ambassador to senegal to the honorable abudu yesufu eke ambassador to the united states from nigeria and last of all to our own ambassador thomas r pickering and his excellent staff at the unitedstates embassy in lagos nigeria one must be aware both of the significance of the interparliamentary union conference in lagos and also of the very close ties between this country and the federal republic of nigeria which used the american constitution as a blueprint for its own democratic government the honorable alhaji shehu shagarl president of the federal republic of nigeria and commanderinchief of its armed forces stated in his opening remarks to the ipu thatthe interparliamentary union has over the years succeeded in establishing for itself a good reputation as an institution for the fostering of international understanding peace and harmony through a healthy exchange of parliamentarians and parliamentary practices and procedures he further stated i am fully convinced that this exchange and crossfertilization of ideas has helped a great deal in promoting wider international understanding and cooperation not only among lawmakers but also among the dif ferent states represented in the union the interparliamentary union has fostered international peace unity and harmony through constant dialogue i would ask to include the full text of president shagaris speech at the close of my remarks i was assigned to the committee on nonselfgoverning ter ritories and ethnic questions and i am also submitting for the benefit of the house the draft resolutions which came out of that committee and which will be voted on in rome in september of this year the central issue of concern in the ipu committee on nonselfgoverning territories as well as elsewhere in discussions amongst the african and other third world delegates was south africas continued occupation of namibia it may be difficult for many americans to understand the immediacy and depth of feeling attached to this issue indeed in the past 18 months we have been encouraged by officials within our government to redefine the situation in southern africa and to view it from within the definitions of ideological and geopolitical conflicts that trou ble western europe in doing so the united states has taken a giant step backward into the 19th century this is a naive and dangerous view not one on which strong and lasting unitedstates relations with the countries of africa and the third world can be based it is a view in which even our staunchest nato allies part company it is a view attractive to people who have completed political science sequences within universities which stress only the history of 19th century political conflicts between european nations however it is a view which has nothing to do with the realities of contemporary africa and with the determination of nonwhite populations to shake off the yokes of colonialism and apartheid anyone who fails to see that this struggle against apartheid and its extension to namibia will remain the primary determinant of african sentiments toward america and europe is dangerously insensitive and out of touch in this regard it is clear that current unitedstates policy toward southern africa represents at best a highrisk strategy which shows no signs of working at worst a dangerous drift toward permanently redefining unitedstates commitments to human rights and lacial justice the implications for our own society are extremely troubling the negative impact that this apparent attempt to reverse unitedstates policy is having on our relationships with the nations of africa and the third world was starkly evident in lagos i do not wish to make a partisan speech but it is recognized that outside of africa unitedstates diplomatic interests and long range strategic objectives are extremely frayed within africa unitedstates interests are held hostage by and are completely at the mercy of the south african government at any moment some event within south africa or namibia or even some event external to the region may crystallize world sentiment against the united states i submit that this is a result of the radical policy reversal that has taken place within the past 18 months it is not a solution in which the congress can afford to acquiesce the reagan administrations southern africa policy is based on two conflicting views the first is that south africa is a bulwark against soviet expansion and as such must be supported by the united states no matter how repugnant its internal policies the second view is that the africaners are a prickly people who must be humored by the united states if they are to be encouraged to make changes essential to their own survival the truth of the matter is that south africa has no intention of making changes within south africa nor of seeing an independent government come to power in namibia so long as it can avoid it unless it is forced to by events which remain unforeseen the south african position with respect to the united states is simple as previously articulated by south african officials in meetings with our own government some time ago south africa feels that through internal repression and the forced relocation of black and nonwhite populations it can contain any developments which might occur among its black and nonwhite populations provided the united states will guarantee protection from any outside force including south african freedom fighters who are foreigntrained or fighting with foreign advisers like a hapless giant the united states has apparently acquiesced the result is ai increasingly dangerous isolation of our government in africa and among the nations of the third world in addition those major nations such as nigeria which risked their own international standing in order to counsel patience in this and other conflicts now feel increasingly that they have been toyed with by the united states in short we are at a pivotal point the positive regard with which our efforts in southern africa were viewed has been dissipated a policy which is not seen as bungling is increasingly viewed as duplicitous my question is is it worth it for the united states and is this dangerous drift in unitedstates relations something to be acquiesced in by the congress i believe most of my colleagues are unaware of how radical the unitedstates policy drift has been the documented information i cite has been developed by the house committee on foreign affairs and puts into sharp focus criticisms that were made by the ipu delegates it is time we took a hard look at the unitedstates policy shift in the 18 months that it has been in office the reagan administration has initiated a number of changes in american policy toward south africa following are some of the changes which have been undertaken in march 1981 the administration granted visas to three senior south african military intelligence officers including general vander westhizen chief of military intelligence and the former south african military attach6 who had been asked to leave the united states following the expulsion of the unitedstates military attach6 in south africa even though there was a policy of not permitting senior military army and intelligence officers to come to the united states visas were issued to these three officials supposedly by error they subsequently met with unitedstates ambassador to the u n jeanne kirkpatrick and officials at the national security council and the defense department the united states upgraded its milltary attache office at the american embassy in pretoria and allowed the south africans to do the same in washington in november 1981 and march 1982 two south african generals visited the united states as part of a namibia negotiating team in october 1981 two police officers attended international conferences in the united states the presence of these officials casts doubt on the departments earlier statement that the admission of three south african generals was in error the united states permitted the south african government to establish as many as five new honorary consulates in the united states in pittsburgh seattle phoenix cleveland and denver the city of pittsburgh has strongly protested the administration changed the foreign policy export controls in june 1981 to permit the sale of medical equipment to the south african military and to permit the sale of crime control devices to the south african government it should be noted that shortly after the completion of this sale a group of south africans were able to smuggle arms out of south african over land in an aborted attempt to overthrow the government of the sychelles the administration further amended the foreign policy export controls in february 1982 to permit the sale of items to the south african police military and security forces previously the carter administration had refused american companies permission to sell any items to the south african police military or security forces the new administration policy makes it easier for american companies to sell computers to those agencies and ministries in south africa responsible for enforcing apartheid the departments of state and commerce have agreed to gralit two american companiesbeechcraft and piperlicenses to export up to 22 air ambulances to the south afncan air force these will probably be used to ferry wounded troops from namibia to south africa the south african government wants to purchase at least six of these planes which can also be configured as troop carriers and intelligencegathering planes in 1981 the united states permitted approximately 20 south african nuclear technicians to come to this country to receive training at unitedstates government facilities the administration approved the travel of several american technicians from the department of energy to travel to south africa to investigate that countrys coal to gas conversion process previously such cooperation between unitedstates government agencies and south african government agencies had been denied in march 1982 the administration granted an export license to an american companycontrol datato sell a cyber 170 750 computer to south africas governmentcontrolled center for industrial and scientific research csir the cyber 750 is one of the most advanced computers made in the united states and can be used for advanced nuclear research to model nuclear explosions and for breaking sophisticated encripted codes csir is an agency of the south african gov ernment research operation which has broad responsibilities which overlap americas nuclear regulatory agency bureau of standards and national science foundation two unitedstates companiesedlow international and swucoacted as brokers in the sale of highly enriched uranium fuel for south africas koeburg nuclear reactors in order to circumvent unitedstates nonproliferation laws the department of state may have been aware of this transaction arguing that public statements are counterproductive the administration has backed away from the basic human rights principles of the carter administration and has ceased to make any public statements about south africas ongoing human rights violations the administration vetoed a u n resolution condemning south africas invasion of angola last fall and did not protest south africas earlier attack on the african national congress in mozambique the administration has not criticized south africas support or rebels attempting to overthrow the governrients of angola and mozambique more subtly the administrations fiscal year 1982 aid request recommended elimination of the unitedstates contribution to the u n trust fund for south africa the money from this fund was used to pay lawyers in south africa to defend black and white south africans arrested for political offenses or for violating south africas aparthied laws the administration also asked for reductions in unitedstates contributions to the u n trust fund for namibia which is used to help train and educate namibian refugees the administration refused to go along with a joint french british and german initiative to condemn the south africans for forcibly relocating thousands of blacks from the cape town area in the dead of winter to their socalled homelands 800 miles away in the transkei it refused to protest the unexplained death in detention of dr neil agaitt a white doctor who was arrested for his work advising black trade unionists the administration has not publicly condemned the impending execution of three black south africans for political offenses in addition to risking unitedstates relations with other nations and to committing the united states to a policy which is repugnant to our own institutions and to the overwhelming majority of the american people there is already ample evidence that the administrations new approach has not worked in fact it may have encouraged the south african government to take even harsher measures against both blacks and whites who oppose its apartheid policies there are indications that the administrations policies may be enco raging the repression of moderate elements within south africa and increasing the commitment of the people of south africa and of namibia to change at any price in the past 18 months the south african government has made no meaningful reforms instead its actions have been in the direction of greater repression in 1981 the south african government arrested and detained for political reasons over 300 black trade union members many of them leaders of some of south africas most moderate trade unions these arrests and detentions without trial continue dr neil aggit a white labor union official mysteriously died while in detention and at least two other black officials had to be taken to mental institutions following intensive questioning the south african government has banned two black newspapersthe post and the sunday post the gov ernment had previously banned the world and the weekend world the post was the largest circulation daily in south africa and the countrys principal black newspaper the government has refused to allow bishop desmond tutu to travel outside of south africa by revoking his passport bishop tutu is an opponent of apartheid he is the head of the anglican church in south africa and secretarygeneral of the south african council of churches bishop tutu was to be the keynote speaker at the allard lowenstein memorial lecture series at yale and to receive an honorary doctorate at columbia the government has forcibly removed thousands of blacks in cape town and relocated them hundreds of miles from their families in impoverished semiarid rural areas the government has stepped up its bannings and detentions of both white and black student leaders including the banning of alexander borraine the son of a progressive member of parliament the government has continued to establish bantustans and to revoke the citizenship of blacks relocated to these areas i urge all my col leagues to pay 4 closer attention to events in this region i urge them to make clear that the commitments of the united states have not changed i urge this because i believe it is right and just because it is strategic and because it is the most prudent course of action for our own society at this point i ask that the following statement which i presented at the ipu meeting be included in the record"], [0.45545703172683716, 0.5445429682731628, 1, "i rise in strong support of h r 5617 a bill whose simple purpose is to permit the unitedstates coast guard to do its job last year our subcommittee on coast guard and navigation conducted hearings into all phases of coast guard operations and procedures we found a coast guard both terribly overburdened and critically underfunded last november the subcommittee released an oversight reportentitled semiparatus the united states coast guard 1981 calling for significant increases in funding and major changes in the nature of coast guard responsibilities the goal of h r 5617 is to provide the coast guard with the resources it must have to carry out its major atsea operational missions including search and rescue marine law enforcement and military readiness in addition the bill would relieve the coast guard of statutory responsibilities which have threatened to transform it from a uniquely proud and independent military service into just another part of the bureaucracy h r 5817 reflects a broad consensus of opinion among members of both parties on the committee on merchant marine and fisheries it constitutes an approach to the coast guard which i believe has the support of the vast majority of the american people this legislation is however only an authorization bill the dollar figures we propose here will mean little if the money is not appropriated and i have little reason to believe that full funding will in fact be forthcoming as a result i feel i must warn all members of this house that the coast guard of the future may bear little resemblance to the coast guard of the past my warning about the future stems from the fact that the reagan administration is not comfortable with the coast guard of the present it has after all requested a coast guard budget for 1983 which is 20 percent below the level congress appropriated in 1982 the administration is asking us to envision a smaller coast guard which it calls streamlined but which others simply call less capable the administration has asked us to mortgage the coast guards future through cuts in recruiting and training a reduction in the size of the coast guard academy and cuts in the research and development program the administration has proposed a coast guard less able to maintain aids to navigation less able to guarantee safe operations in our ports harbors and waterways less able to respond to a military emergency less able to enforce the law and most tragicallyand inconscionablyless able to respond it a timely manner to those who may be in danger of personal injury or death on the high seas i do not happen to share the administrations judgmeht that a less capable coast guard is in the best interests of the united states but make no mistake the continuation of present budgetary policies will lead to a steady decline in the ability of the coast guard to perform the many jobs which it is constantly called upon to perform by the people of our country last december when the fiscal 1982 coast guard authorization was called up for consideration i warned members that coast guard stations would close and vessels would be decommissioned if more money were not forthcoming many did not take these warnings seriously but 1 month later the closure of coast guard facilities in all parts of this country was announced and 1 month after that the department of transportation decided that a little more money for the coast guard might be necessary after all i simply want to suggest to members that in considering the coast guard budget they reflect for a while on the nature of their own past rhetoric those who warn urgently of the need for a strong national defense should recall the active participation of the coast guard in every war or significant military conflict in which our country has ever been engaged those who speak about the importance of putting a halt to the smuggling of illicit drugs should realize that the coast guard last year seized contraband valued at more than the entire operating budget of the service those who decry the entry of illegal aliens should reflect on the role which the coast guard has played in deterring the tragedyprone efforts of haitian migrants attempting to reach florida those who express concern about the sanctity of human life should remember the 5 500 lives saved last year by the coast guard and those who reserve their deepest emotions for the material might note that coast guard search and rescue operations also accounted for 2 billion worth of rescued private property i challenge anyone to suggest that the united states is ill served by the coast guard i challenge anyone to make a credible case that the skills of coast guard men and women will not be in even greater demand in future years h r 5617 is designed to improve the ability of the coast guard to contribute to the overall national interest of the united states it is i believe a sound piece of legislation containing numerous minor changes in law designed to guarantee the most effective use of those coast guard resources which are available but h r 5617 should also be interpreted as a warning the coast guard in the past has always been there when called its personnel have grown steadily more skilled more versatile and more valuable but the coast guard of today is in very deep trouble the service simply cannot continue to function competently without additional funds i ask therefore that you support h r 5617 but i ask also that you realize that there is currently ongoing a very major battle over the coast guards future i ask that you reflect on the past present and future importance of the coast guard to our country and i ask that you express your support for the coast guard not only today but in the even more crucial votes which may occur later this year or early in 1983 finally i would like to extend my personal thanks to the ranking minority member of the subcommittee the gentleman from alaska and to the other members of the subcommittee on both sides of the aisle who have made it abundantly clear that notwithstanding the disagreements which i have articulated this afternoon with the administration on this issue that the future of the coast guard is in no sense a partisan question i the roles the statutory missions of the coast guard are missions abundantly in the national interest of the country and ought never to be viewed in a partisan context"], [0.457682728767395, 0.542317271232605, 1, "a year ago i took the well in this house to discuss what i believe is the most difficult and critical problem facing the united states the decline in productivity growth i said then that congress had to focus its efforts on putting the puzzle together and launching a comprehensive strategy to improve productivity although productivity was at that time already a buzzword on capitol hill little was being done about it and the outlook was not encouraging unfortunately i am afraid the same can be said today there has been so much talk on the subject of productivity that perhaps it is worth reminding ourselves why prompt action in this area is so important as i see it there are at least four reasons why improved productivity must be a top priority for the federal government first and foremost i believe productivity is the neglected longterm key to our fight against inflation it is obvious that when the costs of labor raw materials and physical plant increase those higher costs will be translated entirely into higher prices for goods and servicesunless productivity is improved the second point is closely related low productivity growth is contributing to the weakening of the dollar by reducing the competitive edge of american products and thereby undermining the balance of trade third steady productivity growth is important to expanding employment here the relationship is perhaps less obvious and may contradict the assumption among rmany people that productivity simply means fewer people doing the same amount of work but as we should learn from the current discussions of supplyside economics more costeffective production is the key to business expansion and thus to expanded employment finally these benefits add up to a social or political argument for a strong productivity policy as we have progressed through successive antiinflation policies in the last few years americans have been asked repeatedly to make sacrifices i believe the country is willing to make those sacrifices but only if there is a visible and realistic path toward improvement ahead to date there has not been a comprehensive and coherent policy for improving productivity can provide that crucial glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel when i addressed the house a year ago on this subject the economic report of the president for 1980 had just been released that report was rather fatalistic on the question of productivity since it is difficult to identify a single cause for a slowdown in productivity growth the report declared the immediate prospects for improvement in productivity are not good the attitude of mr carters council of economic advisors eventually improved the final economic report of president carter released in january abandons last years gloomy prognosis and asserts unequivocally that a program to stimulate productivity growth must be a keystone of economic policy intentions however have yet to be transformed into reality the sad fct is that there is no federal program to foster productivity improvement several federal activities scattered among various agencies and amounting to more than 2 billion do contribute to private sector productivity but the closest the federal government has come to establishing a productivity program which might coordinate these disparate activities and set clear productivity improvement goals is a deservedly obscure entity known as the national productivity council established by president carter under an executive order in october 1978 the record of that productivity council is a travesty upon its very name since 1978 the council has convened on exactly four occasions and has garnered a barely fulltime staff of two people with no funding last year i characterized the council as an interagency group which rarely meets and accomplishes little this year i am spared the embarrassment of repeating myself since the general accounting office in a thorough evaluation which has just been released has provided its own assessment the gao notes that the key responsibilities assigned by the president to the productivity council were first coordinating and supervising productivity activities throughout the federal government second identifying for the president and the congress key issues pertaining to productivity improvement and third serving as a focal point within the executive branch for productivity issues with special liaison to business labor and academic leaders on this subject the gao report concludes that the national productivity council has not effectively accomplished any of these functions in other words as a government and as a nation we have been wasting our timetime which we cannot afford to lose the councils inactivity has coincided with a 2year period of national productivity declineonly the secondand now the longestsuch period since world war ii the councils poor performance would be less discouraging if it were an isolated event unfortunately it is the fifth unsuccessful productivity group to be formed at the federal level in the past decade against that background of past failure i welcome president reagans determination to make a fresh start i am particularly pleased that the president has given productivity a high priority in his recent statements and i look forward to working with him toward that end i am today reintroducing legislation which i first offered a year ago which would create a statutory visible fully funded and fully staffed national productivity council this proposed council is fashioned upon recommendations of the general accounting office and i believe it can succeed where its forerunners have failed this council would be assigned specific and important responsibilities which the gao has concluded on the basis of its past experience will be essential to a successful federal productivity effort these responsibilities will include first the formulation and annual revision of a national productivity improvement plan second analysis of those federal activities which hinder or encourage improved productivity in the private sector third legislative and regulatory recommendatiods to the congress for enhanced productivity fourth consultation with representatives of business labor and academic institutions on the subject of productivity improvement and fifth coordination of various federal activities related to productivity why do we need this council above all because when we have 2 billion worth of independently evolved programs affecting productivity we need to have some coordination of them we need to analyze the effectiveness of our total effort to assess where the gaps are in that effort and to discover what more could be done for example in its recent report the gao found that current federal expenditures in the area of productivity were not evenly distributed among activities related to productivity less than 2 percent is spent for improving human resources through programs for skill training hiproved labor mobility job security and labormanagement cooperation the report found i believe that an active forceful and respected national productivity council could help to redress such imbalances by calling them to our attention and by suggesting corrective measures the council could similarly restore a balanced perspective to the current obsession with business investment as the total cure for lagging productivity certainly increased capital formation is an important component of any effort to improve productivity but investment alone is not the answera fact which we are in danger of forgettiog today we are poised on the brink of accepting a multibilliondollar tax cut for accelerated business depreciation which has been promoted as a panacea for declining productivity growth yet as even business weeks analyses have shown the capital cost recovery act has a highly differentiated effect on various industrial sectorssome benefit greatly others benefit very little as we well know there is already a considerable range of productivity growth rates within the private sector the proposed tax benefits of the 1053 legislation do not always correspond to the sectors in need as pat choate and gail schwartz point out in a recent book on sectoral revitalization we need to know whether acrosstheboard tax incentives would encourage the flow of capital into those vital industries that need it the most in order to modernize and ultimately become more productive the historical precedents would suggest the opposite faced with such crucial policy dilemmas i am convinced the existence of a professional national productivity council could be extremely helpful we need a neutral third party whose sole concern is the federal impact on productivity and to whom we can turn for reliable advice in short we need an unrelenting spokesman who will keep the issue of productivity uppermost in our minds and make us aware of how federal policies affect it there is of course considerable hostility today toward any proposal to create a new government organization not surprisingly some of that antagonism was directed last year toward my proposal for a new productivity council let me assure those critics that i share their skepticism and their concern about government bureaucracy moreover i fully acknowledge that the crucial decisions affecting productivity growth will be made in the private sector nevertheless we must face the fact that we live in a mixed economy and that a federal government which spends more than 22 percent of gross national product and whose taxing and regulatory policies broadly affect the private economy ought to have some agency within it that attends to the nations no 1 economic problem governments of other industrialized nations such as japan and west germany are much more involved with labor and business in developing a consensus policy for maintaining high productivity growth we would do well to take our cue from their success my proposal for a statutory productivity council would not add to the burden of government but rather would respond to a serious weakness in governmental performance as the recent gao report noted all key economic decisionmakers in recent years have recognized the importance of productivity growth to our economic strength yet when economic policies are made productivity concerns seem to be given low priority the new productivity council would not be an economic deci sionmaker but would participate in economic and budgetary decisionmaking to ensure the presence of a productivity perspective naturally some members will not be persuaded that spending 5 million on a productivity council to oversee 2 billion in current productivity programs is a worthwhile investment to these colleagues let me offer a more compelling costbenefit analysis as a 1978 report of the council on wage and price stability observed the effect of slow productivity growth since 1967 has been to reduce total real incomes by some 20 percentmore than 300 billionfrom what they would have been if the pre1967 productivity growth rate had been sustained clearly we cannot afford not to invest in a more productive future last summer the retiring chairman of the house subcommittee on economic stabilization scheduled 4 days of hearingswhich i chairedon the problem of lagging productivity growth and what the federal government should do about it in my opinion those hearings were very useful in sharpening our understanding of this issue in particular they reinforced my conviction that something like a statutory productivity council is needed in the executive branch i would like to take a few moments to share with my colleagues some highlights from those hearings which in my view strengthen the case for the legislation which i am reintroducing today during the initial hearing testimony was given by an associate director of the office of management and budget omb on behalf of the current productivity council ombs presentation revealed a startling devaluation of the productivity problem high inflation and energy problems which dominated the 1970s omb testified must be solved before the productivity growth rate can be restored to its previous level when during quistioning of the witnesses i suggested that this statement reflected a disturbingly passive approach to the productivity issue 0mb simply reaffirmed its view that productivity growth will result when the economic policiesof the administrationtake hold this determination to put the cart before the horse says a good deal about why the existing productivity council has been such an abysmal failure most experts in this field i think would agree that lagging productivity growth is a major component of inflation rather than the other way around no productivity council worthy of the name can succeed when it is a captive of ombs perspective on this point one of our subsequent witnesses economist lester thurow from the massachusetts institute of technology saw the issue much more clearly productivity is obviously the countrys number one problem when productivity is going downhill it doesnt make any difference what is happening to inflation or enemployment you are going to have an economy thats going downhill although the public opinion polls havent put productiv ity in the number one slot 1 think the congress ought to put it in the number one slot at one point in the discussion i asked mr thurow whether he thought the united states would benefit from some kind of independent group that might be perceived as a little less partisanthan the congresssuch as a national economic commission or a national productivity council professor thurow largely concurred i certainly think there is a lot of value in information especially in the productivity area productivity is one of those kind of background things whiph doesnt make the headlines well we are not going to address the productivity problem until the american people in fact decide that it is an important problem that they have to address one of the traditional barriers to productivity efforts on a national level has been the opposition from many sectors of the labor movement which feared from past experiences that productivity was just another name for speedup or reduced labor force thus some of the most instructive and encouraging testimony received by our subcommittee came from mr donald ephlin a vice president of the united auto workers in his opening statement mr ephlin underscored his own unions willingness to tackle a tough issue we recognize that the only reliable basis for improving the purchasing power and access to leisure of american workers is the increase in the economys capacity to convert a given amount and intensity of work into ever more output in keeping with that recognition the uaw has explicity pledged not to oppose the introduction of productivityenhancing laborsaving technological advances on the specific subject of my legislation to create a statutory productivity council mr ephlin observed that the uaw is in strong support of objectives mr ephlin went on to make a crucial point with respect to a productivity councils potential effectiveness the national productivity improvement plan that the council is directed to develop will not be regarded as authoritative and viable unless it incorporates the agenda of labor and business by including them in the proposed council a tripartite committee would be created the parties would have the opportunity and the responsibility to find a common ground between often conflicting sets of goals as a public official who has been involved in the labormanagement cooperation movement for many years i have seen what it can achieve in the area of productivity and i wholeheartedly agree with mr ephlins tripartite proposal the legislation i am introducing today does create an advisory board to the productivity council whose members are to be selected entirely from individuals with experience in business labor and academics the bill does not take the further step of placing such individuals on the council itself but i am quite open to that possibility and will be exploring that alternative structure in the weeks ahead appearing on the same panel with mr ephin dr richard rahn vice president of the unitedstates chamber of commerce endorsed the same notion of tripartite communication among business labor and government but added i dont think there is a need for a formal government intervention in this process fortunately not all of the probusiness community seems to feel the same hesitation for example the american enterprise institutes committee to fight inflation chaired by former federal reserve board chairman arthur burns recently issued a ninepoint antiinflation plan i was pleased to note that in one of those points the committee urged congress and the president to actively encourage labormanagement councils in individual shops offices and stores throughout the country so that workers and managers will jointly seek ways of improving productivity perhaps the most persuasive testimony from any witness last summer was the presentation from the american productivity center this private nonprofit organization based in houston tex has done pioneering work with numerous businesses to improve productivity the organization is chaired by c jackson grayson former head of southern methodist universitys business school and was represented at last summers hearings by one of its directors mr william usery former secretary of labor mr usery had this to say on the productivity council legislation which i am sponsoring although i and the american productivity center believe that h r 6462 may not go far enough in its particulars we believe it is a most important step toward a firm commitment by our government to improve productivity efforts within the private sector have proved successful but are limited by the relative absence of government commitment to implementing solutions one might expect a private organization like the american productivity center to dismiss a government productivity group as intrusive and unnecessary on the contrary however mr usery explained in some detail the benefits which the center anticipates would result from a federally formulated productivity improvement plan the federal government would be helping to bring together elements of the business labor and government communities such a friendly meeting of the minds would be beneficial to america and certainly beneficial to productivity the concept of a national productivity policy has many advantages over other economic measures we have already tried other measures such as cutbacks controls regulation spending subsidies protectionism the result has been in most cases a failure a successful productivity program promises to avoid the problems inherent in these other actions no one expects that a national pro ductivity council by itself will reverse the deceleration in americas productivity growth productivity is an enormously complex issueone which must be addressed simultaneously on several fronts certainly the diverse testimony we heard last summer confirmed that point but paradoxically a productivity council might help us make some progress by reminding us of that very complexityby insuring that congress does not attempt to solve our productivity problems by seizing upon on simplistic cure in my statement on productivity a year ago i outlined four general areas each encompassing several policy issues where i thought our efforts could be profitably focused first improving the use of human resources second enhancing capital formation third expanding the commercialization of advances in knowledge innovation and fourth reforming the regulatory process i can only look back over those remarks today with acute frustration if a national productivity council were monitoring congressional progress in these areas we would not receive high marks for achievement during the past year in the absence of that kind of thirdparty neutral assessment let me take my remaining time this afternoon to list some of the legislative objectives which remain unfulfilled i will not take time as i did last year to discuss these measurses relevance to productivity but i do believe each item forms a part of the puzzle"],

roosevelt the florida state senate then in session paid its tribute to the late president on that occasion the distinguished chairman of the apprt priations committee of the senate honorable jack gordon and dr william rogers a member of the history faculty of florida state university since 1959 spoke movingly and cloquently of the great contribution of president roosevelt to his country and the cause of freedom in the world i ask unanimous consent that their able remarks from the journal of the florida state senate follow my remarks in the record senator gonon mr president senators saturday january 30th will be the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of franklin delano roosevelt i was sort of distressed as i looked through the senate handbook and discovered there are only five of us here who would have been old enough to have voted for him at least once and probably not too many who can really remember the time he was president it is a significant memory for me because first of all it was the first presidential eetion in which i ever voted it wds in 1944 aboard a ship in the pacific voting absentee i also have a very vivid memory of the day he died i was in an infantry unit in okinawa and we got out of our foxholes that morning and got the news it was a time when we were faced daily with deatn of friends and buddies and yet the sadness of that day is something shared by everyone that i dont forget very easily also i happen to have a meme y of his inaugural i dont think anybody who really didnt live through the depression and understand it can really appreciate the kind of impact that he and his administration had but i remember his inaugural i renember the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and listening to that on the radio in detroit in a house that was about to be foreclosed and in a city where the banks had been closed for three or four months and where nobody really had any money what happens when you go over a budget and you dont have any money you print your own the city of detroit was paying its employees in script and if you went twenty miles outside into another city you could dis count that script for sixty or seventy cents in order to have some real dollars because everybody wouldnt take the script when you come through experiences like that it obviously molds the way i which you look at government and the way in which you look at life i thought that since today there is a joint session of congress which is going on for the purpose of comniemorating roosevelts birthday that the least we could do here in a state that roosevelt visited many times is have some few moments of examining that part of history so we asked dr sliger if there werent someone on the faculty at fsu who had a particular interest in the area he suggested we get dr william rogers it turned out that dr rogers was not only a wellknown local historian but a very popular teacher and his knowledge of the south seems to make him one of the most popular teachers the courses he instructs for the center for professional development are among those most soughtafter in the continuing education curriculum he has been a member of the fsu history faculty since 1959 he earned his bachelors and masters degrees from auburn he is a native of alabama he got his phd from the university of north carolina and wrote his dissertation on the populist movement in alabama the heritage of that populist movement we occasionally as a matter of fact quite often see here particularly among those of our members who come from north florida dr rogers who is noted for his ability to blow away the dry dust of history is here today to try to bring alive some of the memories of franklin roosevelt it is really a pleasure to introduce dr rogers dr rogens franklin delano roosevelt was born at hyde park new york on january 30 1882 he died at warm springs georgia of a cerebral hemorrhage on april 12 1945 in the remarkable career that spanned those sixtythree years he is best known to us and to history as the thirtysecond president of the united states he would have been one hundred years old this saturday fdr as he was popularly called came from dutch and english ancesters who had settled in the hudson river valley in the seventeenth century in 1887 when he was five roosevelt was introduced to the then president grover cleveland patting roosevelts head cleveland said my little man i am making a strange wish for you it is that you may never be president of the united states fdr was brought up as an aristocrat the family mansion overlooked the hudson river and he spent quiet summers in england had governesses and private tutors went to prep school at groton and was an undergraduate at harvard he was athletic active in campus activities and popular with his classmates but he was not a brilliant student at harvard roosevelt edited the crimson and graduated in 1904 later he attended law school at columbia university was admitted to the bar in 1907 and practiced law in new york in 1905 he married his distant cousin eleanor roosevelt they would have six children eleanors uncle theodore roosevelt himself came to new york to give the bride away in 1910 fdr entered politics and campaigning in a red maxwell convertible was elected to the state senate frd always liked to drive fastto the later dismay of secret service agents roosevelt had a lifetime love for the sea and for ships from 19131920 he happily served as assistant secretary oi the navy we know i ow about the affair between fdr and lucy mercer later mrs winthrop rutherford lucy was eleanors parttime social secretary the affair began apparently in 1917 eleanor found out and threatened a divorce at that time such a scandal would have ruined the career of any aspiring politician and so the affair ended in later years they met at different times and there is no doubt butthat the episode permanently scarred the relationship between eleanor and franklin tall slender handsome and articulate roosevelt was named as james m coxs running mate in 1920 the national election was a disaster for the democrats and a landslide victory for warren t harding and the republicans the defeated vice presidential candidate wrote to a friend franklin d roosevelt ex v p canned erroneously reported dead roosevelts political career seemed ended in 1921 after swimming in the cold waters of the bay of fundy off camptbello island where the family had a summer nome he had an attack of polio seemingly he was a hasbeen at thirtynine yet he made a courageous physical comeback even so he would never work again without the use of crutches and by wearing heavy iron braces during his recovery roosevelt was helped and encouraged by his wife and by louis howe an albany journalist he discovered the waters of warm springs and the small georgia town became a haven for him roosevelt had dshi and flair like his fifth cousin teddy in 1924 he laboriously made his way to the podium of the national democratic convention and placed the name of governor al smith of new york before the delegates fdr called him the happy warrior smith had to wait until 1928 to get the nomination and then he lost to herbert hoover that same year roosevelt was elected governor of new yurk this placed him in the national limelight and made him a contender for the democratic nomination in 1932 meantime the great depression hit with devastating impact and rightly or wrongly hoover got the blame we were in the most severe economic crisis in our history unemployment and breadlines were daily watchwords fdr renewed his quest for the nomination and aided by james a farley a political wizard who knew everybody and signed his chatty letters in green ink got it accepting the nomination roosevelt promised us a new deal in 1932 most of us knew nothing about fdr he seemed slightly snobbish and he certainly spoke in patrician tones walter lippman the nations most respected political analyst wrote of fdr that he is a pleasant man who without any important qualifications for the office would very much like to be president roosevelt accordhig to lippman simply does not measure up to the tremendous demands of the office of president roosevelt not only won the nomination he won the election at his inauguration he told us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyzes efforts to convert retreat into advance congress was called into special session for the famous hundred days and the nation got an unprecedented amount of legislation designed to combat and get us out of the great depression we got the national industrial recovery act the securities and exchange act the civil works administration the tennessee valley authority the agricultural administration act a civilian conservation corps was established and so was a public works administration still later would come the national labor relations act the national youth administration the social security act the works progress administration and many others since roosevelt was elected four times we can conclude that his political abilities were exceptional brilliant and probably touched with genius he had a streak of engaging good humor surface geniality and the gift of dramatizing political issues opponents saw him as cynical vindictive devious a doubledealer a man with an insatiable thirst for power admirers viewed him as warmhearted humanitarian courageous and magnanimous the truth lay somewhere between the extremes but he was a highly complex personality roosevelt was a pragmatist he said it is common sense to take a method and try it if t fails admit it frankly and try another la above all try something in truth the new deal brcame an intricate set of compromises after the new deal the government would never again be considered a mere umpire for economic and social activity it became a participant roosevelt was a magnificent speaker his fireside chats were called exercises in mass hypnotism americans huddled around their radios listening to fdr speak really thought he was talking to them personally in the bleak 1930s we welcomed a voice of concern not surprisingly he inspired both love and bitter hatred we wrote him letters like we had never wr tten letters before we certainly pulled no punches one person wrote dear president roosevelt im proud of our united states and every time i hear the starspangled banner i feel a lump in my throat there aint no other nation in the world that would have sense enough to think of wpa and all the other as another wrote my dear sir it is expensive and a headache to have a playboy as president wipe that grin off your face and so it went one wrote dear honored mr roosevelt i never saw a president i would write to until youve got in your place but i have alivays felt like you and your wife and your children were as common as we were another sincere and earthy tribute came from a tired textile worker in north carolina who wrote fdr youre the only president weve ever had who would understand that my boss is a s o b roosevelt did not pull the country out of the depression but his confidence gave us confidence he was flamboyant and charisrmatic he projected an image of caring if some of his programs failed others succeeded the jaunty thrust of this face which led some to call him moosejaw pleased most of us voters if he wanted to wear pincenes glasses use a long cigarette holder and drink two old fashions a day iwe didnt care his reelection in 1936 was mindboggling he carried every state except maine and vermont after the votes were counted someone hung a large banner across the highway leading from new hampshire into maine it read you are now leaving the united states by the late 1930s the domestic new deal waned and foreign affairs became uppermost we know that roosevelt broke historical precedent in 1940 when he became the first president to be elected for a third term he was reelected for a fourth term in 1944 fdr presided over the nations fortunes during world war ii the crises the tension the responsibilitiesall were demanding and all took their toll he was a highly successful commander during the conflict and both friends and foes concede that in many ways he was a casualty of the war although fdr looked terrible in his last months his sudden death shocked us all it upset me as a boy in a rural town in south alabama it simply was unacceptable any other man as president was inconceivable yet he was dead roosevelt was mortal he was flesh and blood he certainly made mistakes but he is one of the giants of the twentieth century this enigmatic personality was truly a world leader it is a measure of the man that many people in the united states refer to his era as itie age of roosevelt thank you very much"], [0.46005260944366455, 0.5399473905563354, 1, "i thank the chairman for his remarks i want to express my appreciation to the distinguished gentleman from mississippi the honorable sonny montgomery to the able gentleman from arkansas the honorable john paul hammerschmidt to the ranking minority member of the full committee and to my colleague the honorable chalmers wylie of ohio the ranking minority member of the subcommittee i would also like to thank all of the members of the subcommittee for their efforts to help get the reported bill to the floor today we are considering a bill to provide a costofliving increase in benefits for veterans who were disabled as a result of their milltary service and for the widows and orphans of veterans who died of serviceconnected causes the bill is designed to assist these individuals to make sure that their level of benefits is not eroded by the ravages of inflation the bill would provide an average 7 4 percent increase effective october 1 i wish to assure you and my colleagues that the funding level contained in this bill does not exceed the targets established in the first concurrent budget resolution additionally it is not inflationary in that it simply provides a costofliving increase based on the anticipated rise in the consumer price index between 1982 the legislation is necessary since the serviceconnected program for veterans and widows is not indexed by laws serviceconnected compensation is payable to veterans who suffer from a disease or disability incurred during service the percentage of disability for a specific disability is assigned by the veterans administration that agency has established a schedule for rating disabilities which is the guideline for measuring the degree of disability compensation is paid for disabilities at ratings of 10 percent 20 percent and so forth up to 100 percent the rate of compensation payable for each percentage of disability is established by law additional compensation is payable for the loss of a limb blindness and other severe disabilities an additional dependency allowance is payable to veterans with a rating of 30 percent or more for a spouse minor children or dependent parents historically the congress has increased compensation rates whenever there has been an appreciable increase in the costofliving index since the rates are not indexed to the consumer price index by law this is necessary to insure that inflation does not erode july 297 1 982 the purchasing power of those drawing compensation and dic benefits widows and children of veterans who die of causes determined to be service connected are entitled to monthly payments of dependency and indemnity compensation the purpose of this benefit is to provide partial compensation to the designated survivors for the loss in financial support sustained as the result of the serviceconnected death income and need are not factors in determining a surviving spouses or childs entitlement since the nation assumes in part the legal and moral obligation of the veteran to support the spouse and children payments of dic for surviving spouses are determined on the basis of the veterans service pay grade rnd range from 415 monthly for the surviving spouse of an e1 to 1 061 monthly fbr the surviving spouse of an 010 surviving spouses are entitled to an additional 48 monthly for each child it is well established that the congress has placed the very highest priority on the payment of compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation benefits to eligible veterans and survivors the bill also contains several program changes first it would provide entitlement to va compensation to members of the senior reserve officers training corps if during military training camp a participant suffers a disabling injury my very capable colleague from south dakota the honorable thomas a daschle called to our attention the fact that where an rotc member suffers a fatal injury during summer camp his widow is entitled to dependency and indemnity compenss tion dic but if he is seriously injured and does not die he is not eligible to receive benefits from the veterans administration the individual is only eligible for federal employees compensation under section 8104 of title 5 united states code which is substantially lower than va compensation the bill would correct this inequity the bill would also increase the compensation rate for certain blinded veterans by equalizing benefits for totally blinded veterans without light perception with those who have suffered the enucleation of the eyes or deformity or scarring an increased compensation rate would also be payable to veterans who suffer from serviceconnected blindness in both eyes 5 200 visual acuity or less and who additionally have incurred the serviceconnected loss or loss of use of one hand or one foot this increased compensation is considered to be warranted because the loss of an extremity has a greater impact on a blinded veteran than on an individual who has not lost his or her sight the honorable christopher h suirru of new jersey the honorable albert lee smith of alabama and the honorable joseph f smith of pennsylvania addressed these issues in h r 6154 and h r 6155 the bill wculd reinstate the 300 burial allowance for certain wartime veterans whose remains are unclaimed and whose estates do not contain sufficient resources to defray the cost of the funeral and burial of the deceased under the provisions of public law 9735 the omnibus reconciliation act of 1981 the 300 nonserviceconnected burial allowance was terminated for many veterans exceptions to this discontinuance were veterans who were drawing va pension or compensation benefits at time of death or who died in a va facility following the adoption of the reconcillation act last year the press publicized accounts of many bodies being held in county and city morgues when no funds or next of kin were available to provide a proper burial investigation of this situation revealed that the press reports were greatly exaggerated however committee investigation revealed that some cases did exist and action is warranted to make certain that the unclaimed body of a wartime veteran is not buried in a paupers grave this provision of the bill corrects the oversight which occurred by the enactment of public law 9735 additionally it would authorize payment of the burial allowance in cases where a veteran dies in a va contract nursing home the provisions of section 903 a title 38 united state code authorize payment of the 300 nonserviceconnected burial allowance whenever death occurs in a va facility to which the deceased was properly admitted for almost 20 years the va has followed an interpretation by its general counsel that contract nursing care constituted care in a va facility for purposes of eligibility for burial benefits public law 9735 provided that the benefit would no longer be payable unless the deceased veteran was in receipt of compensation or pension or unless he died in a va facility the congress relying on the long standing interpretation of current law on this issue did not place any limit on deaths in either a vaowned facility or in a contract facility earlier this year the va general counsel issued an opinion reversing an earlier opinion issued almost 20 years ago that death in a contract nursing home did not constitute death in a va facility for purposes of establishing eligibility for burial benefits in his latest opinion he did not consider the issue of congressional ratification of the earlier decision manifested by legislation enacting a number of amendments and restrictions placed on payment of burial benefits therefore there is no alternative but to seek legislative remedy the bill would further authorize the administrator to furnish a flag to the next of kin of certain persons buried in a national cemetery public law 9343 which became effective june 18 1973 extended the privilege of being buried in a national cemetery to nonveterans in certain instances so designated by the administrator this would usually involve an individual who performed outstanding and meritorious service to this nation this provision of the bill would authorize the administrator to provide a burial flag to any distinguished individual so honored by burial in a national cemetery at the request of the department of defense the bill would provide that the position of superintendents of national cemeteries administered by the department of the army need not be restricted to only those who have been disabled in the line of duty prior to 1973 the department of the army administered 84 national cemeteries and required that each superintendent meet the serviceconnected disability requirementa requirement which has been in effect since 1948 when 82 of the cemeteries were transferred to the veterans administration under the provisions of the national cemeteries act of 1973 the act removed the requirement that superintendents for national cemeteries administered by the veterans administration be disabled veterans it continued the disability requirement however for superintendents of army national cemeteries the army anticipates extreme difficulty in filling future vacancies for the superintendent positions at arlington and the soldiers home national cemetery this bill would enable the army to avoid that difficulty the bill further contains a technical amendment with respect to entitlement of dependency and indemnity compensation under current law a surviving spouse or child is eligible for these benefits only if the veteran was at the time of death in receipt of compensation for a disability rated as total for 10 years prior to death or for 5 years and continuously from the date of discharge under this amendment a survivor would be eligible for benefits at dic rates if the veteran was entitled to receive compensation at the total rate during t e requisite period it is intended to create entitlement in survivors when the veteran was not assigned a total disability rating for the requisite duration because of va error at the request of the veterans administration the bill would remove the bar against payment of servicemens group life insurance sgli and veterans group life insurance vgli proceeds in the event a claim is filed more than 4 years after the insureds death the bill also clarifies that such proceeds may not escheat to a state the bill enhances the quality of care for veterans in medical facilities operated by the veterans administration by insuring the provision of such care and necessary related services by federal employees this provision is contained in the bill as a result of an amendment offered by my very distinguished colleague the honorable marvin leath of texas a proposed revision to omb circular a76 mandates ronversion to contract for those services with 25 or less employees without requiring cost comparison studies to ascertain the cost effectiveness of such conversions the bill specifies that va services not be contracted out unless the administrator after giving proper consideration to the recommendation of the chief medical director determine it is not in the best interest of the veterans and the agency to do so high quality health care for veterans continues to be one of the committees highest priorities and this is demonstrated by the fact that h r 6315 which is identical to this provision in the bill was cosponsored by 28 members of the committee the bill also complies with the reconciliation instructions to the committee on veterans affairs contained in the first concurrent budget resolution it contains several program changes which if enacted would realize savings totaling 169 7 million in budget authority and outlays in fiscal year 1983 185 9 million in fiscal year 1984 and 195 million in fiscal year 1985 the congressional budget office has advised us that the savings will be 400 000 more than what is shown in the body of our committee report and this amount is reflected in the above figures the bill contains the following costsavings provisions first rounding down pension and compensation benefit checks to the next lower dollar issuing pension checks in even dollars would realize savings of 10 8 million in fiscal year 1983 10 4 million in fiscal year 1984 and 10 1 million in fiscal year 1985 rounding down compensation and dic benefits to the nearest whole dollar would save 18 3 million in fiscal year 1983 18 5 million in fiscal year 1984 and 18 6 million in fiscal year 1985 second amending the definition of a dependent child for pension purposes to exclude college students over the age of 18 this would be phased in over 4 years to protect current student beneficiaries this would save 13 4 million in fiscal year 1983 18 1 million in fiscal year 1984 and 21 7 million in fiscal year 1985 third delaying payment of compensation and pension benefits until the first full month of entitlement rather than from the effective date of the award by postponing the start of the payment period but not the effective date itself for purposes of other va rights savings in the compensation account would be 9 million in fiscal year 1983 10 million in fiscal year 1984 and 10 4 million in fiscal year 1985 pension savings are estimated at 19 8 million in fiscal year 1983 20 7 million in fiscal year 1984 and 22 million in fiscal year 1985 fourth changing the effective dates of reductions and discontinuances of compensation dic or pension by reason of a veterans change in dependency status from the end of the year to the end of the month in which the event occurred savings for compensation would be 1 4 million in fiscal year 1983 1984 and 1985 savings for pension would be 1 8 millon in fiscal year 1983 2 1 million in fiscal year 1984 and 2 5 million in fiscal year fifth terminating the correspondence training program this would realize savings of 5 6 million in fiscal year 1983 4 9 million in fiscal year 1984 and 4 2 million in fiscal year sixth imposing a 0 5 percent user fee on va loans the average fee would be about 285 with an exemption for serviceconnected veterans drawing compensation benefits under chapter 11 of title 38 united states code savings would be approximately 89 6 million in fiscal year 1983 99 8 million in fiscal year 1984 and 104 1 million in fiscal year 1985 mr speaker the above program changes meet our reconciliation requirements for the next 3 years although the majority of these proposals will have minimal impact upon exitsing benefiti and services i personally have reservations about the imposition of a users fee on va loans i wish to point out however that it is only temporary the authority to collect such fee will expire on september 30 i think it only fair that we do it this way the fee should only be paid during a period of time when we are in a severe economic slump it is my understanding that certain tax provisions considered by the senate last week in their tax bill are also temporary in nature in particular i refer to senator helms amendment that the additional tax on tobacco expire october 1 1985 it is my belief that we should not continue to impose a users fee on veterans many of whom served during wartime applying for va loans once the country reaches a measure of economic recovery again i would like to point out that this bill will have no inflationary impact and is well within the budget authority and outlays as contained in the first congressional budget resolution it has an overall cost of 539 in budget authority and 486 in outlays for fiscal year 1983 this bill is vital to our serviceconnected veterans and i urge that it be adopted"],

is without a doubt one of the more effective members of congress he is an activist and i can recall when he was elected 8 years ago that many said that an activist simply could not make it in the congress of the united states he could give a good speech lead a cause and be out there in front but he would not get something done but what the gentleman proved was that an activist could be effective in congress for without a doubt toby morfett was one of the more effective coalition builders in this congress let it be an issue of energy and he would find common cause in an oil producing state so that together the interests of both for the betterment of the people of the united states could be advanced i think specifically of the fight of 2 years ago when the issue was funding for the whole question of fuel assistance and we in the north and the northeast were told that it simply cannot be done because the money will not be there so what did this leader do he reached out to texas he found a problem that was unique in that area and he found a goal which was one that could be advanced for both and as a result we were able to benefit the old the frail and those who needed relief

intensive efforts in our committee and in conference with the senate throughout this time the assistance of the gentleman from arkansas the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on water resources has been invaluable i also wish to express my deep appreication to the gentleman from new jersey the chairman of the full committee for his usual fine leadership and the ranking minority member of the full committee the gentleman from california for his outstanding cooperation and assistance a special expression of thanks is also owed the house conferees who did an outstanding job of defending the house position in conference in 1972 the congress enacted landmark legislation providing for an intensive effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate the discharge of pollutants into our nations waters the federal water pollution control act amendments of 1972 set increasingly stringent standards for discharges of industrial and municipal wvastes for municipal wastes it required secondary treatment by 1977 and the application of best practicable waste water treatment technology by 1983 the 1977 date for secondary treatment was later extended to 1983 for those communities which were unable to meet the date because of a lack of federal funding in connection with these new requirements for secondary and best practicable treatment the act provided a 75 percent federal grant share for construction of publicly owned treatment works the grants were to be available for such categories as secondary treatment more stringent treatment infiltration inflow correction major sewer system rehabilitation new collector sewers interceptors and appurtenances and correction of combined sewer overflows earlier this year the administration proposed drastic changes in the construction grants program this was coupled with an announcement that fiscal year 1982 funding would not be supported unless the congress passed legislation making changes in the program also as part of this process the reconciliation act reduced the fiscal year 1982 furlding to zero with the provision that 2 4 billion would be authorized in the event that legislative changes are enacted into law the conference report i bring to the floor represents the response of the house and the senate to the administrations call for changes in the program it recognizes the need to reduce federal participation in the program in view of existing and expected budgetary constraints however and this is most important the states and localities are given a period of time in which to adjust to and make accommodations for their increased responsibility the eligibilities for grants remain essentially intact until october 1 1984 after that date the federal share will be reduced from its current 75 percent to 55 percent in addition categories of treatment works eligible for grant assistance will be limited to secondary and more advanced treatment interceptors and correction of infiltration inflow problems however up to 20 percent of a states annual allotment as determined by~the governor may be used to fund otherwise iiieligible categories such as collector sewers sewer rehabilitation and correction of combined sewer overflows with regard to reserve capacity projects which receive a step 3 construiction grant for a treatment plant or interceptor prior to october 1 1984 will remain eligible for grant assistance for 20 years for reserve capacity in the funding of the remainder of the treatment plant and 20 to 40 years for interceptors for projects receiving the first construction grant after october 1 1984 federal grant assistance will be limited to the capacity needed to meet the needs industrial and residential existing as of the date of award of the step 3 construction grant however grant assistance will not be available for needs over and above those existing on october 1 1990 with regard to the federal share if a step 3 construction grant is approved before october 1 1984 for a segment of a treatment plant or interceptor then subsequent grants for the rest of the treatment plant interceptors and infiltration inflow correction will be at 75 percent the statement of managers includes language urging the appropriation of funds to implement section 2 06 of the federal water pollution control act this section provides a mechanism for the reimbursement of communities which proceed with construction of treatment works at their own expense if the treatment works meet all of the requirements of the act this enables communities to save money by moving ahead before federal funds are available and thus avoid the increased costs associated with inflation this provision of the act however has not been funded in appropriations acts this has resulted in an unfortunate and unnecessary increase in cost for t~he program both to local interests and to the federal government with the reductions in federal assistance incorporated in h r 4503 it is even more necessary that ways be found to decrease overall costs associated with the reduction of pollution of our nations waters permitting construction at presentday prices with reimbursement later is one way of doing this one glaring example of the types of difficulties which are created because of the lack of proper implementation of the reimbursement provision in the act is found in the district of my distinguished colleague mr mottm the four communities of rocky river bay village fairview park and westlake in suburban cleveland ohio built a sewer treatment plant with epa guidance however when this pilot program plant was completed it turned out that it did not operate properly the plant when finally completed with design modifications will serve about 80 000 residents the attempts on the part of local communities to receive reimbursement from epa go back many years they have been unsuccessful both because of the lack of funding for section 206 and because of epas unwarranted allegation that the project involving as it does advanced technology of an experimental nature does not meet the criteria of a normal construction grant project i wish to assure the gentleman that in my opinion the local communities are entitled to reimbursement and should be reimbursed upon the appropriation of funds for that purpose there is one other provision in the conference agreement that i would like to mention section 4 provides that the administrator shall make a grant from any funds o therwise allotted to the state of california to the city of san diego in connection with that citys aquaculture sewage process system as an innovative and alternative waste treatment process the eity of san diego is planning to construct a wastewatertopotable recycle system the product of this

of reclaiming water for municipal purposes this is the sort of thing which should be encouraged especially in view of the droughts which have occurred in recent years our committee has long maintained

pursuant to its delegated authority and were not disapproved by epa until some time later the provisions in section 4 are designed to correct the inequity which would result if the local communities

officiallyif somewhat belatedlypay tribute to the city of los angeles which recently capped a yearlong celebration by commemorating its 200th birthday it was 200 years ago on september 4 1781 that el pueblo de ha reina de los angeles sobre el rio de ha porcuincula was founded as the first spanish civilian settlement in southern california today the towers of the new downtown los angeles skyline cllong shadows across a bustling plain where an indian village a spanish colonial settlement a mexican provincial capitol and a yankee boomtown lie buried beneath the bicentennial celebration just concluded helped make angelenos aware of the richness of their history which i now commend to the attention of my colleagues the initial settlers of los angeles consisted of 11 families 22 adults and 22 children who were recruited from the provinces of sinaloa and sonora in new spain now called mexico by capt fernando de rivera y moncuda emissary of the governor of california felipe de neve they included farmers artisans and stockraisers necessary for the survival of the settlement escorted by spanish soldiers they departed from los mlamas sonora on february 2 1781 and arrived in the summer of that year their goal was to establish an agricultural pu nli to provide rood for soldiers at the presidios at san diego and santa barbara ranging in age from 1 to 67 the pobladores reflected the cultural henltage and racial diversity that link thle citys past to it present almost all of the settlers from the surrounding province of sonora were of mixed blood three ethnic groups were represented among the earlier settlers spanish indian and black twentysix of the pobladores were of african ancestry since spanish law had always made it easy for black bondsmen to buy their freedom in new spain and custom had raised no barriers to intermarriage the three reasons for the choice of the site were the obvious fertility of the land the availability of water and the nearby location of an indian village called yang na thus the settlers would enjoy the prospect of agricultural productivity water and a source of labor no eyewitness account of the pueblos founding has ever turned up since none of the founding fathers could read or write however mythmakers have cloaked the days events in suitable splendor depicting governor de neve on horseback at the head of a procession of priests soldiers settlers and converted indians by the start of the 20th century the ceremony was thought to be the most extensive and most impressive ever held over the founding of an american city in the spring of 1822 word reached el pueblo that mexico had won its independence from spain california was now mexican territory angelenos of the day dutifully changed the flag flying about the plaza replacing the spanish lion with the mexican serpent the transformation for los angeles came with the acquistion of california by the united states at the end of the mexican war gradually the little mexican settlement was transformed into a yankee town the key being the increased american population the first notable anglo to reach los angeles was abel stearns in 1832 stearns was born in massachusetts but lived and had become a spanish citizen in south america as the town grew so did its needs the first railroad south of the tehachapis formally opened and the first train left the new los angeles depot on the morning of october 26 1869 with the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1872 many chinese came to los angeles some in the search for gold others just seeking a new way of life like their black and brown brothers before them they found discrimination but remained and persevered by the turn of the century los angeles was already experiencing the escalation in property values and shortage of downtown parking space which continue to this day indeed los angeles in the early 1900s was overwhelmed with growth due in large part to the infant oil drilling and movie industries the events of the 20th century have left their mark on the tiny pueblo which has seen its population soar fromn 102 000 in 1900 to nearly 3 million today world war ii of course had a special significance for the citys 40 000 residents of japanese descent and the citys postwar boom fueled in large part by the growth of the areas aerospace industry has exascerbated the problems of transportation and air quality which confront the presentday mayor city council as well as its legislative delegations today 200 years later los angeles finds itself as the third largest city in this

its land area is larger than any major city in the world in addition to its fabulous beaches that area boasts the only major mountain range to be found in any american city the santa monicas and at the eastern tip of those mountains lies griffith park the largest municipallyowed park in the country culturally los angeles retains all the glitter and glamour of early hollywood and then some the

usually comfortable on the house floor and comfortable in the proceedings of the house but i am not today i am more upset about what is going on now than i have been since those sort of private times when i tried to influence policy decisions on the korean war and the vietnam war incidentally i was virtually never successful i am terribly worried about this performance because i have as the members will see as i try to explain what i am saying the deepest respect for two of the people who are heavily involved in this first i am very sad that this is happening this way and i say this not with any lack of sympathy for the republican members of the house i have witnessed the same kind of thing going on the democratic side particularly when lyndon johnson was the president when the white house presumed to take over the whole process i do not mean to be unkind to anybody on the republican side but it is very clear that the timing especially with regard to the great push to bring up this particular matter at this particular time was masterminded by the white house and perhaps some members of the house that i do not know but certainly not the leadership in such a way that it would have an overwhelming political smell i am not sensitive about politics you know i know about it and i have played legislative politics as well as substantive politics most of my career but this is really an extraordinary example it is an example of a party that had had a very strong program which went astray and then the party had the good sense to modify it somewhat that has happened in the last roughly 20 months i guess it is i am not going to go into any detail but it is very hardit is very very hardto come to a conclusion any other conclusion than that the timing on this is a diversion i would not be worried about it if the principal actors in this were only the president and jim baker and ed meese and the other white house operators the only sad thing about it is that a man whom i admire enormously and think would make a quite good prestdentand i hope i am not hurting him when i say thishas apparently been the hit man on this the vice president i hope that is not true i hope it is the others because i have come to expect that from them even including lyndon johnson and richard nixon this is the most political white house i have ever dealt with it is so much a politicalwhite house that it sort of frightens me because it does remind me of a combination of johnson and nixon and if that does not fnghten people we have a problem that is why i am sad and i am quite serious about this i have great admiration for the republican party and many of its members i am also sad because one of my best friends on the republican side of the aisle and one of the men i admire the most is the author of the base resolution i have a strong feeling that i understand why he is in that position he just got so fed up with the democrats that he thought anything was better than what they were doing and i do not even blame him from his point of view it makes sensenot from my point of view i have almost gotten in that situation a couple of times and never quite made it but i do not belong to his party i am not trying to be funny i am telling you why i am concerned but the bottom line of why i am concerned is the substance the gentleman from new york crafted the best possible bad resolution and the fundamental thing that is wrong with that resolution is that it demonstrates that he has truly given up on the essential democratic process he puts certain things in his resolutioneven though much more wisely drafted than most of the ones i have seen and many of those resolutions have been created by democratswhich would require supermajorities to decide that there will be an unbalanced budget some very estimable people on the republican side again whom i admire have made the point that we already have a supermajority that we have a supermajority in the twothirds required to override a veto but dear god does not anybody understand that in a government cleverly and carefully crafted to separate the powers so that no one power would become the tyrant that the veto override process is the great clash in the american political process between a convinced executive and a convinced congress that simple twothirds requirement is the only one and here we are not talking thank god and thank mr conable about anything quite as bad as a twothirds supermajority i can bring this rule to the floor only because i am convinced that it is the best rule we could possibly have for a completely outrageous situation that should never come up at this time in the flow of congress there can be all kinds of arguments made that the democrats prevented it from coming up any other time that is simply not true if the big five were going to put the heat on people some of whom are directly opposed to this proposition they could have done it earlier if they had really wanted to generate the steamand they did generate the steamit could have been done practically anytime even earlier this year now what is political about this it is inescapable to me that it is a diversion it is inescapable to me that the timing is a diversion the substance is not but the timing is a diversion now why is it upsetting me why am i worried my worry is very minor it has to do with me i am worried that i will not present this as well as it could be presented i am upset because i fear we are going to do grave damage to the republic and its processes i have been one of the earliest people to recognize that we must have a responsible process a budget process that gives us a rational approach i have been defeated by my party on occasions by both parties on occasion in seeking that opportunity the bill that we have been operating under for a number of years i crafted to a large degree and when i presented it to the house which voted virtually unanimously for it i tried to make it clear that it was not a very good bill that it needed a lot of change and that its future depended entirely on the will of the membership one of the tragedies of our time has been that in this institution we were unable to achieve what was achieved in the senate until very recently the budget resolutions have been a totally partisan matter i have no intention of trying to lay the blame for that there cannot be a partisan budget approach many of the democrats have never understood this what you do in your fight over a budget resolution is fight out the alternatives and come to a conclusion and then if you really believe in a budget process you have some responsibility that it functions and even if you do not win you need to vote for the process that may be a strange idea to some of you who have never looked at process as being that complicated and that restrictive but that is the way you are going to deal with these major problems if you ever do there are a lot of democrats who need to learn this lesson that we must have the process if we do not have a process which deals with the macroeconomic situation in the united states we will revert to the boom and bust of the period prior to world war ii administrations of great variety for years gave us a relatively steady approach to macroeconomic problems it is something that has to be done and it has to be done by this institution along with others we are dealing with the greatest single issue that faces the society the free world and all the democratic countries because none of them even the parliamentary ones have successfully dealt with it in this approach to using the constitution as the vehicle we crush the proper approach which is that we must have the will to pass legislation that will deal with economic problems and then we have the character the courage and the wisdom to deal with it in a bipartisan fashion i do not believe there is any future for this country literally if we think that one point of view by itself can prevail i do not think the democratic party by itself can prevail with the policies that we must have i do not believe that the republican party can prevail with its policies alone i am deeply committed to the notion that the only way we can function together and survive together is by coalitions of the unlike i am convinced that the good things that were done in a period of political chios in the late 1940s were done in that fashion by a great coalition of the country that put together the policies that made us live very well i think this is exactly the wrong way to go and i think we should defeat all the proposals for a constitutional amendment i think then we should return to an effort to see to it that we have an adequate budget process adequately supported by all of us and not in a narrow political way i reserve the balance of my time"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5479912757873535, 0.5479912757873535, 0, "today i am introducing legislation to provide needed tax incentives to help stimulate the development of our nations domestic energy resources this legislation the energy research and development tax incentives act of 1981 provides tax benefits to encourage private energy research and development activities and to facilitate the development and use of new energy technologies i believe that this tax incentive can play a key role in helping our nation tap its great energy potential and in reducing our reliance on uncertain foreign oil supplies it would also have important secondary benefits including the creation of new jobs the growth of various supporting industries and the generating of additional tax revenues from increased economic activity this legislation provides a 20percent investment tax credit for the capital costs of private sector energy research and development activities this incentive would be applicable for all energy research and development expenditures over and above a fixed level based on a 5year historical average of previous expenditures by any particular concern in this area the fixed level used in the calculation of eligible expenditures would be modified for tax years prior to 1985 in order to reflect administrative and bookkeeping realities my legislation permits this tax credit to be carried back for 3 years and to be carried forward for 7 years under appropriate conditions expenditures that would be covered under this legislation would include those relating to research and development activities in the extraction conversion storage transmission and utilization of fossil nuclear solar geothermal and other energy sources and in energy consevation this credit would take effect on january 1 1981 and would expire on december 31 1992 the science and technology committee has spend a great deal of time investigating the means to help cur nation develop more efficient and productive new energy technologies it was most disturbing to learn that the united states presently ranks 13th among 17 international energy agency nations in government support for research and development according to recent i e a estimates as for private sector support a harvard business review article released in the summer of 1980 pointed out that private sector investment in research and development has been steadily decreasing in recent years with no changes foreseen in the future this is a dangerous trend which i believe must be reversed as soon as possible in spite of these problems the administration position is that the federal government should only be involved in longrange highrisk research and development activities which private industry cannot reasonably be expected to undertake on the other hand industry is expected to support activities relating to the development of nearer term technologies based on this philosophy the administration has recommended dramatic reductions in funding for many energy research and development programs for fiscal year 1982 compared to last years appropriations levels during hearings on the department of energy authorization bill for fiscal year 1982 the committee heari from 22 witnesses on the need for strong government support to overcome the various market barriers affecting the use of new energy technologies and more efficient energy conservation techniques these witnesses have had a longstanding involvement in the energy area and gave our committee their expert views on energy research and development from an academic industrial consumer and governmental perspective several of these witnesses recommended investment tax credits in order to stimulate necessary energy research and development activities this incentive would help promote the development of promising new energy technologies without the need to conform to burdensome federal government management and reporting practices i believe that an investment tax credit for private energy research and development is vital if our nation is to continue to pursue the development of high payoff energy technologies that can help us develop and utilize our energy resources in a more efficient and effective manner according to several experts tax incentives for energy research and development are the most effective means of stiinulating increased private research and development spending at the present time with the removal of regulatory constraints following close behind these incentives are also compatible with the administrations approach that nearterm technologies should be the responsibility of the private sector in one particular area of concern to the science committee several witnesses indicated that conservation research and development programs were highly costeffective and antiinflationary and should be continued these programs support the develop ment of many new energyefficient processes in the residential commerclal industrial and transportation sectors for example several of the most energyefficient industrial processes now contemplated show that energy consumption per unit of output could be reduced by close to 50 percent with new technology under development in these programs dr dale jorgenson of harvard university specifically indicated that the impact on inflation due to increased petroleum prices is reduced by close to 50 percent if effective conservation programs are implemented several other witnesses indicated that foreign industry and governments were already making inroads into our domestic markets for new heat pumps furnaces and engines and that as a result there was a growing need for federal support to stimulate the development of new energyefficient conversion technologies made in the united states tax incentives were strongly recommended as one of the most effective means to encourage the continuation of many of these conservation research and development activities in another area of concern the science committee received a great deal of information and advice during the 96th congress on our nations fossil energy programs from an advisory panel on synthetic fuels this panel was convened by the science committee in order to explore the current state of synthetic fuels technologies and the related technical and engineering issues associated with the largescale production of synthetic fuels the panel was also asked to evaluate the department of energys current synthetic fuels research and development program and recommend any appropriate changes after many long hours of work the panel came to several important conclusions regarding the scope and direction of a national synthetic fuels program one of the major conclusions of this distinguished group of industry financial and government representatives was that tax incentives were one of the most effective mechanisms to assist in synthetic fuels production andthat they should be made available to stimulate technology improvements in this area consistent with these recommendations i believe that we need to provide strong tax support if our nation is to maintain an effective energy research and development program many of the experts which have recently testified before the science committee have made it very clear that there are many important areas where free market forces acting alone cannot provide the necessary incentives to stimulate private energy research and development activities the president has already recommended a 3year accelerated depreciation writeoff for the capital costs of research and development in his economic recovery program just recently the administration has proposed another research and development tax incentive which would provide for a 25 percent income tax credit for research and experimental wage expenditures i applaud the administrations leadership in this area my legislation attempts to supplement the presidents proposal in this area and encourage the private sector to move forward in an aggressive manner in energy research and development with minimal federal involvement in addition a recent seri report entitled building a sustainable future recommended a tax credit for corporate research investment which is 125 percent of actual expenses in lieu of the present federal tax deduction the premise for this recommendation was that private companies themselves were in the best position to determine what kinds of research were best suited to their needs while my legislation does not go as far as the seri recommendation it does provide a clear signal that our nation needs to maintain an aggressive energy research and development posture research and development has been one of the primary bases on which our nation has attained its world economic leadership the legislation which i am introducing today will help our nation maintain this leadership by stimulating private investment in new and more efficient energy technologies it is not meant to reflect the only appropriate means to stimulate private investment in energy research and development but only to encourage serious consideration of the importance of tax incentives in this area i encourage my colleagues to seriously consider this proposal in the weeks ahead as congress continues to consider a comprehensive tax program e"], [0.5443464517593384, 0.5443464517593384, 0, "the subject is

subjugate the afghan people this is a direct breach of treaties going back to world war i outlawing the use of poison gas it also goes against the various laws of warfare adopted by the geneva conventions the soviets have also destroyed live stock and arable land and poisoned wells this again is in directviolation of the geneva conventions the war has uprooted almost the entire countryside and caused over 2 million people to become refugees along the borders with pakistan and iran this from a country of only 14 to 15 million people the soviets most modern and most effective weapon the mi24 helicopter gunships roaming up and down the countryside firing rockets and dropping bombs have wroilght systematic destructio4 on villages and small cities and have literally ended all rural life in certqin areas by also destroying crops in addition these same gunships have even attacked some pakistani refugee camps which is in direct violation of the sovereignty of pakistan i recently returned from a visit to the afghanistan border area and had an opportunity to meet with many of the afghan mujahodin the freedom fighters i met with pakistaniofficials with afghan families in the refugee camps and listened to what the freedom fighters had to tell about their experiences fighting the soviet troops inside afghanistan the war is 18 months old and no settlenent is in sight the soviets control urban areas which account for some 15 to 20 percent of the total country rural areas are still under the tacit control of afghan freedom fighters not too different from the situation as might have eidstediin vietnam where americans could control the roads by day but by night enemy forces would have control after dark no soviet troops venture away from sovietcontrolled ganisons they huddle inside their tanks inside their armored cars inside their heavily guarded barracks even in urban areas the soviets try to stay out of the pop ulated areas because they are hated and strict curfew laws are enforced yet they are still subject to attack sometimes in broad daylight realizing the strategic importance of this region of south central asia and the vital oil lifelines along the arabian sea and into the straits of hormuz i traveled to those border areas to get a firsthand view of what was happening i traveled with a collearrie of mine congressman joel pritchard from the state of washington and a threemember state department contingent investigating the refugee camps i personally have become convinced that the situation in afghanistan is of truly vital importance to the united states and to the entire western world i intend to bring attention to the situation and the grave problems posed by soviet expansion into the southern central asia area soviet proximity to these oil lifelines is already endangered by their current position in afghanistan the danger becomes greater if they truly gain con trol further soviet expansion south ward couldpose drastic problems for american and european interests in this area by the middle of this decade afghanistan is pivotal to soviet expansion of power in both the persian gulf area and in asia it is the historic land bridge between east and west north and south securing afghani stan an historic ambition of russians going back to czarist times will be a major step toward sovet domination in that area and over the indian ocean if the soviets are allowed to consolidate their hold on afghanistan they will be in a far better position to close the chokepoint of the straits of hormuz the narrow bottleneck through which passes 70 percent of the oil used by europe and japan and a major share of our own imports we all remember what happened in this country when irar stopped producing the soviets are just 350 miles from the straits less than half an hour for a mio fighterbomber and 8 hours for their tanks between those bases in afghanistan and the straits lies baluchistan an area comprised of large chunks of pakistan afghanistan and iran balu chistan straddles the northern shore of the straits and its approaches for the soviets a war of national liberation in baluchistan would further destabilize the region and give the soviets direct overland access to the oil fields the arabian sea the straits and give them another client state in the area as a bonus neighboring pakistan is not without its problems their own internal politics are less than secure adding to pakistans internal difficulties is the enormous refugee population the country is harboring anywhere from 1 8 million to over 2 million as i stated before afghan refugees are packed in tent cities in the border region with pakistan many in the northwest frontier province near the historic khyber pass and the city of peshawar this is the largest refugee population in the world some say it is increasing at the rate of 150 000 month pakistan is a desperately poor and already overpopulated country yet it is footing half the annual bill of more than 300 million to care for these refugees livestock which arrived with the afghan refugees are kept in one of the few fertile regions of pakistan taking up precious farm and pastureland and water vital to the other inhabitants in the words of louis dupree the eminent scholar speaking of the invasion of afghanistan the soviets have engaged in a rubbleization of the villages they have attacked these villages with their helicopter gunships armed to the teeth they encircle the villages with tanks with the gunships hovering overhead and they literally destroy the homes and stores of the afghan people at that point the survivors have nowhere to go so they leave the country they largely go to pakistan and some to iran louis dupree has also termed this migratory genocide it is a genocide when not working inside the country drives the people away from their homes forcing them to seek refuge away from attack mostly in pakistan i would like to yield to my

threat to the health and wellbeing of mankindnuclear war there is no issue before the congress today which is more critical to our survival as a nation and as a civilization last year i introduced two resolutions calling for the elimination of all nuclear weapons the first house concurrent resolution 7 was introduced on january 5 and the second revised resolution house concurrent resolution 151 was dropped in the hopper with the cosponsorship of mr binoham in june both express the sense of the congress that all nuclear weapons should be eliminated the processcalling on the president to negotiate immediate substantial reductions in nuclear weapons on a bilateral basis with the soviet union subject of course to verificationis the same in both resolutions further the resolutions urge the president to call for an international conference of all nations with nuclear weapons in order to plan for the phased reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons througout the world house concurrent resolution 151 has over 60 cosponsors the freeze resolutions which have been introduced by many of my colleagues have over 100 cosponsors the people of the united states have also made it clear that they are concerned with the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear war recent surveys indicate that americans believe we should reduce nuclear arms i strongly believe that the only way to eliminate the threat of nuclear war is to remove the means of creating this ultimate disaster this is the goal which we all shareboth those that advocate a freeze and those who support negotiated reductions if it is true that the united states has a sufficient deterrent force to prevent a soviet nuclear attack then a freeze would be a viable option if on the other hand we would lose bargaining power and increase the threat of a nuclear war or political blackmail due to soviet superiority then we should consider negotiating to a level of equal deterrence before initiating a freeze i urge my colleagues on the foreign affairs committee to debate these critical issues in order to provide an opportunity for the house to express its views on reducing nuclear weapons i am extremely encouraged by the introduction of a resolution by foreign affairs committee chairman clem zablocki calling for strategic arms talks and verifiable negotiated reductions in soviet and american nuclear weapons his leadership on this issue is vital i am also gratified that president reagan plans to endorse bilateral negotiations to reduce nuclear weapons it appears that his statement may parallel the resolution introduced by senators jackson and warner calling for a freeze at equal and greatly reduced levels of nuclear forces i believe we should go beyond all of these proposalsto the actual elimination of all nuclear weapons even the least deadly warhead in use today is thousands of times more powerful than the bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki the destruction that would occur can be illustrated with an example that is very close to homethe consequences of dropping a nuclear bomb on the capitol imagine that we are sitting in this hallowed chamber debating vital questions of the day suddenly the civil defense alarm sounds it emergency call12 bells ring on the house clocks the speaker announces that we are under nuclear attack our much vaunted yet untested nuclear defenses fight off multiple and singlewarhead missiles in great quantity however three 5megaton bombs escape our counterattack and explode on a prime target the unitedstates captiol everyone in this room would be killed instantly by a huge silent heat flash traveling at the speed of light and all of capitol hill would collapse under a supersonic shock wave and winds of 300 to 600 miles per hour a similar fate would befall all living things around the perimeter of the beltway from the center of downtown washington to capitol hill everything would be vaporized leaving a crater several hundred feet deep a fireball over 1 mile in diameter would be created and would incinerate at a temperature of over 20 000 degrees farenheit anything that stood in it path within a 10mdie radius the vast majority of the metropolitan areas population would be killed by the blast wave 200mileperhour winds and fires over 40 percent of those left barely alive would suffer severe burns radiation sickness and traumatic in iuries since most medical facilitites would be destroyed and transportation would be impossible survivors would have no medical care food or water they would die a painful and lingering death as the fire from the bombs could turn into a 1 200squaremile firestorm cooking and asphyxiating even those in shelters survivors would be exposed to fallout and many would die within 2 weeks some may think that many people survived hiroshima and nagasaki and could survive a modern attack but the single bomb dropped on those cities had an explosive force of 15 000 tons of tnt the largest bomb today has the force of 20 million tons of tnt and even the smallest that would be used in nuclear war has the force of 1 million tons of tnt an allout nuclear attack with the launching of over 40 000 weapons by the united states and the soviet union would destroy every major population center in the two countries such an exchange could occur in only 60 minutes and would change the entire atmosphere ecosystem and life as we know it on earth scientists have pointed out that a loss of even 20 percent of theozone layer could blind every animal and insect and destroy our food base an allout exchange has been projected to destroy over 70 percent of the ozone layer i bring these stark facts to the attention of my colleagues to remind them of what utterly vicious and decimating annihilation the world would experience if a nuclear war ever occurred it is literally beyond the true comprehension of many people what perniclous potential we have created with the advent and continuing refinement of nuclear weapons i hope that this important discussion today can lead to a real solution to the threat of nuclear war i urge my colleagues to take the time to consider the realities of a nuclear holocaust it is something we cannot ignore we should join together to make certain that the horrible tragedy of nuclear war does not occur by calling

to raise 98 billion over the next 3 years is to set aside the constitution and the rules of the house and the prerogatives of the ways and means committee and instead defer to the judgment of barely half the other body and only six of our own colleagues swallow hard and look the other way and vote for this conference report to h r 4961 i disagree in the first place that house bill number and its enacting clause are the only part of this bill to originate in the house of representatives article i section 7 of the unitedstates qonstitution to the contrary notwithstanding none of the provisions relating to revenues not one is a part of any bill reported to the house by the committee on ways and means not one what is more or perhaps i should say what is less the house not only did not originate this tax bill but we have not even reviewed it studied it considered amendments or modified it in any way in the house or in the committee charged with jurisdiction to which dor some reason the senate bill sporting the purloined house number was referred most of the public debate so far has dealt with the broad general issues of public policy and revenue aggregates very little has focused on the specific provisions of the billand for good reason after all how can any news or editorial account deal with more than three or four issues at a time there are over a hundred important changes in the tax code scattered through nearly700 pages of this bill the outlines available until today could not describe all the ramifications of these hundred provisions most members are aware of the issue of withholding on dividends and interest but few know that the same will apply to pension benefits in the rush to rescue the former no care was exercised on behalf of the latter as for failure of some to report such income and pay taxes on it all that was required was to impose stricter reporting requirements with triplicate 1099 forms to be attached to your federal and state tax returns just like your w2 that would have garnered half the revenue of this provision beyond that withholding is another way to take money directly out of the savings pool is that going to strengthen our economy another provision which directly damages the business recovery is the doubling of the unemployment tax levied on employers this is not needed to finance the extra weeks of benefits for that is covered by another tax on unemployment benefits but small businesses and other employers in laborintensive industries like our textiles will be severely damaged by doubling the tax it is another higher fixed cost which must be pai even when you are unprofitable no wonder the national federation of independent business is against this bill 7 to 1 because of this one measure there is another provision though that is even worse for them and their employees that is the package of changes to severely restrict pension funds the senate bill was more modest dealing only with limiting the tax benefits for very highincome individuals and limiting the amount they could borrow from their own pension fund the conference report went much further it will seriously impact 92 percent of all 600 000 pension plans in this country it will terminate an estimated onethird of them that is worse than erisa those that survive will have to file extensive amendments and reports at a cost of 2 5 billion that is probably the worst achievement of the bill then there is the severe erosion of the recently enacted accelerated de predation incentives the biggest change is the cancellation of changes now scheduled for 1986 and 1987 raising 28 billion in those 2 years alone ironically if that is an adequate word this major change will produce dhly 1 billion in the 3 years of the budget resolution to which this tax bill is a response this will levy 20 billion a year in the outyears in order to boost the first 3 years collections by a mere 1 percent no wonder the business community is unhappy with this bill this gives them unappreciated deceleration instead next on my list is the doubled excise tax on cigarettes this was done we are told to avoid levying any similar tax increase on whiskey wine beer or even cigars all these were exempted one product was singled out as the fall guy dont tax you dont tax me go tax the fellow behind that tree yet instead of a 100percent tax increase on cigarettes alone just a 25percent increase spread over the whole group of products would have afforded the same revenue at a lighter burden on any one no wonder those of us in the southeastern tobacco states are opposed to this unfair provision we have been told by house conferees that they did not need our votes for this bill that we were isolated and that we would stay that way another unheralded but damaging provision is that dealing with completed contract accounting the intent is fair to tax the earlyyear profits on a multiyear contract the gentleman from south carolina pointed out that it would be unfair to require such a contractor who had not yet been paid to have to borrow money to pay the tax on earnings not yet received he was right his amendment to correct this was disregarded then there is the unhappy insurance industry lured at first to endorse a tax of 1 billion on their business they helped design a way to do it without disrupting the competitive balance between stock companies and mutual companies this bill overreaches that mark and does disrupt that balance yet they gamely support the bill for fear they will be treated worse if they do not my colleagues these are not trivial little parts of this tax bill these seven provisions make up 38 billion worth or about 40 percent of the 98 billion total there are other features that should have had closer attention the grease payments have already been mentioned the compliance features have some merit but how will you feel if your tax accountant is obligated to flag your return for an audit for aiy deduction that was previously routine and unchallenged by irs but for which there yet is no revenue ruling surely there should have been some hearings on these and other measures

m peter mcpherson responded aid does not and should not provide or promote abortion services my amendment will make this statement a statutory requirement first the amendment spells out in clear and unambiguous language that aid funds whether direct or indirect cannot be used for the provision of abortion it is my understanding based on documentation provided to me by aid that official aid policy prohibits funding for abortion if that is the case my wording reinforces this existing ban on abortion funding and precludes the provision ofthe act or process of providingabortions or abortion research second this amnendment expresses the intent of congress that research and development on abortion methods and techniques is not a proper use of government funds while i am encouraged by the promulgation of administrative aid policy that apparent ly ban funds for research on abortion techniques and methods i believe w~e need to clarify in no uncertain terms that this kind of destructive research wvill not be funded at all by the taxpayer all research and development of abortion methods and techniques whether direct or indirect is prohibited aids past sponsorship of abortion methods research is significant because of the streamlined network of research facilities made possible in large part by aid contracts in the past several years hundreds of abortion research projects have been funded by aidprojects that have vastly increased abortion methodology and technique as an example consider the 7 7 million of aid moneys that went to northwestern university medical school in chicago in 1978 its program on applied research in fertility regulation sponsored an international conference in the bahamas entitled pregnancy termination out of the conference came one of the few medical textbooks on abortion practice and procedure pregnancy termination edited by gerald zatuchni john sciarra and j j speidel interestingly mr speidel was at one time the director of the office of population for the agency for international development this taxpayers funded publication includes the latest information on abortion techniques the most advanced methods of ending life for the smallest and most defenseless member of the human familythe unborn this book describes in graphic detail methods of abortion in the first trimester and beyondthrough the second trimester through the end of 6 months many of the techniques described in this book are new some are only experimental but all are funded and promoted in part by aid funds one of the most horrendous and grisly methods of abortion is the dilatation and extractiona second trimester procedure that was developed to a large extent with aid moneys in this method the unborn child is grasped with forceps and is twisted and turned and removed from the womb the book pregnancy termination describes it this way the forceps is utilized to grasp fetal parts in what is essentially a blind manner the physician must proceed simply by touch and skill in this technique can be gained only by experience tissues too large to pass through the cervical canal can usually be made smaller by tightening the ratchet and then twisting or rotating the forceps care must be taken to avoid undue traction so that the fetal tissues will not lacerate the cervix the fetal spine and calvarium are especially likely to cause this complication in the event that the tissues that are grasped fail to descend easily into the cervical canal and rotating and twisting the forceps provides little benefit the forceps must then be reintroduced into the uterine cavity and the tissues released regrasping the tissues in a different area perhaps with rotation or twisting will usually correct the difficulty gentleness and patience are especially important during this portion of the procedure following removal of all available fetal and placental tissue the cavity is explored first by sharp curettage and then by suction to ensure that it is completely empty all tissues must be identified and accounted for before the patient is returned to the recovery room this should be accomplished not only by the operator out also by another trained individual if doubt exists the uterine cavity must be reexplored consider also that in fiscal year 1979 aid funded more thon 30 abortion research projects and one of the prime recipients was johns hopkins university which received 11 of these 11 the majority were directed toward research and development of advanced techniques of second trimester aboi ions some of the specific methods developed at least in part by the aid grants to johns hopkins included the intraamniotic hyperosmolar urea and prostaglandin f 2 alpha and the calcium method whereby the calcium acts as an agent to bring on delivery during the second trimnester additionally the johns hopkins program includes over 60 scholarly articles on abortion techniques again funded by aid three examples of

contained a 3 billion housing subsidy the president strongly objected t6 that provision and i agreed with his position and voted to sustain the veto however i said at that time that my support extended only to the housing provision the urgent supplemental which is now before the house does not contain the 3 billion housing subsidy i support this bill and i will vote to override the presidents veto this bill contains some 44 individual items totaling 5 9 billion in budget authority 5 7 billion in rescissions 36 million in transfers and 8 million for the liquidation of 1981

individual conscience and individual judgment my own judgment is that this bill should be enacted into law the objections of the president notwithstanding we have been debating urgent supplementals since march and on at least 4 different bills so i would like to takxe a minute to summarize for the members of the house the items contained in the bill before us first of all the bill contains 15 separate items which have been designated as urgent by the administration 3 billion for food stamps urgent transfers for programs in the department of labor and the department of health and human services appropriations for the pell grant program in the department of education 2 4 billion for epa construction grants urgent appropriations for the cab the icc the merit systems protection board administrative expenses in the department of commerce social security mailing costs the unitedstates customs service the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and 1 billion for food stamps the bill contains a number of other appropriations which have been added by the congress 63 million for summer youth employment 210 million for community service employment for older americans 00 million for health services 57 million for the work incentives program 23 million for refugee assistance 24 million for the corporation for public broadcasting 150 for the government national mortage association

service 1 5 million for the tax court 2 million for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for weather stations 40 million for the corps of engineers for use in the mount st helens area i believe the president was right to veto the first urgent supplemental the bailout for the housing industry was a precedent we simply could not afford to set i supported him on that issue and on that issue alone the bailout issue has been settled in the presidents favor the first urgent supplemental was reported by the committee on appropriations in march since that time the urgent supplementals for fiscal 1982 have been frustrated and delayed by 4 months of demogogery and political chicken it is easy to see the importance of 1 3 billion for student loans it is not so easy to see the consequences for innocent federal workers the merit systems protection board has been forced to furlough some 300 workers those workers are in effect being paid half time i ask my colleagues how would you like to support your families and to pay your bills on halftime pay these employees and others have suffered enough from the political games that have been played with these supplementals this bill should be enacted and i will vote to override the veto because of the delay in final enactment of this urgent supplemental appropriations bill the merit systems protection board has been forced to curtail its operations drastically and place its employees on halftime halfpay furloughs inasmuch as there was no certainty as to when or whether the urgent supplemental would be passed the board had to slow its rate of spending remaining funds in order to allow for a skeletal operation to continue if the urgent supplemental question is settled the board will be able to resume full operations with the supplemental funds and it will be able to use the remaining funds under the continuing resolution to pay its employees for the time lost due to the emergency situation it is my understanding that an agency may place employees on administrative leave or excused absence for short periods of time when i has been forced to shut down in whole or in part for emergency or management reaspns in this case the boards furlough was forced by its efforts to maintain a minimal level of operations when there were no assurances that a supplemental appropriation would be approved and signed thus allowing the necessary funds for fulltime operations it seems to me that the board took the only reasonable course available to it under the circumstances when it furloughed its employees instead of spending ahead as if everything was a certainty they attempted to stretch out their remaining funds in case there was no urgent supplemental it would be unfair to penalize the employees because of the failure of congress to pass the necessary legislation to allow the board to operate atfull scale i consider the boards action to be responsible management and in my opinion once the urgent supplemental is passed and available to the board the furlough should be treated as a situation justifying administrative leave or excused absence so that employees can be justly paid"],

special regime labor camp plus five years of internal exile from the estonian supreme court in tallinn on january 8 1981 this is essentially a disguised death sentence because our government frars dissidents and does not discriminate in choosing weapons against them in making this decision the supreme court declared that mart niklus is a repeat offender who is extremely dangerous to the soviet regime because of the following accusations l mart niklus interpreta the 1975 relsinki accords in his own way and acts in an antisoviet manner 2 he uses his knowledge of foreign languages to listen to foreign broadcasts and communicate with foreigners by telephone and mall 3 his friend and sympathizer has been academician andrei sakharov even before dr sakharov was exiled to gorky 4 his favorite authors are alexander solz henitsyn and the worldfamous scholar nikolai vavilov who was brutally and illegally executed in 1943 in saratov by the nkvd secret police now called the kob and was posthumously rehabilitated 5 he dared sign his name to the baltic appeal which demanded that the independence of the baltic states be restored by nullifying the molotovribbentrop pact and removing russian troops and the russian administration from estonia 6 he dared write a protest on the occasion of the soviet occupation of afghanistan and to send it to moscow 7 he favored a boycott of the moscow olympics 8 all this conforms mart nikluss irreconcilable incompatibility with moscows occupation of estonia he discussed his opinion with compatriots and influenced them to have antisoviet sentiments which result in unpleasant disturbances against the prevailing order on january 26 niklus was sent in poor health on a long trip from tallinn through leningrad to the east when we asked the transit commander if mart could be left behind this time because of his illness and be placed in an interim hospital for treatment the commander told us he could make no changes consequently niklus exhausted from illness and his hunger strike was stuffed into a railroad car his condition became so serious on the way that in the beginning of february he was hospitalized in leningrad the news came from mart that on february 10 he had been in sverdlovsk from there he started being shuffled back and forth by railroad without any sort of medical attention or help between camps 36 and 35 between perm and tyumen he was threatened with being sent further and further away until he dies by himself none of the camps in this area want to accept a sick person and certainly not a person that has to be put in the hospital for treatment on february 12 the commander of the specialregime labor camp in perm notified that mart niklus had reached his destination perm labor camp no 36 on march 17 mart niklus wrote about the lack of medical treatment and about his generally ill feeling because of his continuing hunger strike he asked everyone who learns of his situation to appeal to world public opinion to rebuke the executioners and reveal the disguised death sentences that they have given to unfortunate and helpless prisoners this is important because here in our country no lawyer no appeal will sway those programmed by moscow who is not with us we will destroy we will not kill them but we will torture them until the antisoviet type of person dies by himself in order to receive some information about my sons condition we have continually sent appeals and telegrams but to this day they have remained unanswered and have only worsened our forebodings mart was forced to seek legal help from far away because those at home worried about their careers would have nothing to do with his quest for justice vaht and laus did not want to take fathers appeal at all to be forwarded to

a balanced budget the country only had 3 percent unemployment well now we are spending 750 billion and we have about 10 percent unemployment and what happened is that as congress puts more and more of the nations money into the government operations we have less and less capital money available for private enterprise to create jobs what america needs today is to let more money go into private business private enterprise to create more jobs for america and the way you can do that is when america has a balanced budget balancing the budget is the most essential the top priority that faces congress today i stand in strong support of the balanced budget amendment the congress has been unable to discipline itself and its spending habits over the last 20 years as evidenced by the fact that we have not come close to a balanced budget since 1969 the federal budget has been balanced twice since 1960 and during that time our deficits have accumulated to an amount equaling half our national debt which has exploded over 1 trillion it is clear that the current budget process is inadeqaute to keep the congress from spending this country into bankruptcy the american people are tired of reckless federal policy that deflates their dollars and causes their interest rates to soar people in texas see that federal spending rose from 92 billion in fiscal year 1960 to projected outlays of 769 8 billion in fiscal year 1983 the jump in federal outlays between 1970 and 1980 alone amounted to an increase of 194 7 percent in my travel around texas people tell me they are tired of working for the government from januarythrough june just to pay their taxes it is time to balance the budgetthe way to do it is house joint resolution let us talk about why we need the balanced budget amendment house joint resolution 350 does two things first it requires a balanced budgetcongress cannot engage in deficit spending unless threefifths of both houses agree to a specific excess of outlays over receipts second the amendment controls the growth of federal spending by requiring that outlays not exceed receipts the heritage foundation describes the effects of the lack of a spending limitation on congress in the following way without a spending limitation mlembers of congress can accommodate one spending interest and gain political capital without reducing other spending programs and facing political disadvantages the political c6sts of excessive spending are deferred resulting in high inflation if the debt is monetized huge deficits and higher taxes while the political benefits of the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congressmen who support it by the time the negative effects are visible it is possible that those responsible for the harm may have already left office a similar process occurs through the progressive tax structure because inflation and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase we need the discipline of the balanced budget amendment because of what budget deficits are going to average americans for instance uncontrolled spending and giveaways has driven food stamp outlays up almost 20 000 percent from 1970 to 1983 hud subsidized housing outlays increased over 1 517 percent in the same period federal outlays soared from 195 7 billion in 1970 to 731 billion this year those outlays increased over 10 percent in the last year alone look at what this spending has done to the deficitwhich drives up interest rates as the government borrows money in private markets to finance its overspending the deficit has zoomed from 2 8 billion in 1970 to over 100 billion this year continual spending has driven the united states debt from 382 6 billion in 1970 to 1 1 trillion today the debt increased 139 percent between 1970 and 1980 alone and was up 13 3 percent this year from last taxes have also gone up to the point of breaking americans backs to finance the freespending congress individual federal income taxes increased from 90 4 billion in 1970 to 244 billion in 1980 and will be 298 6 billion this year total taxescapital taken out of productive usehave grown from 192 6 billion in 1970 to 631 7 billion this year people have had it and are ready for this congress to rein itself in so they can continue to make ends meet to say nothing of pursing the american dream let us look at what free spending in congress has done to the financial po ition of average americans the tax burden on individuals and families has grown out of control to finance the federal budget the twowage earner family of four with a median income has seen their tax liability more than double from 1 074 in 1970 to 2 717 this year those taxes increased 133 7 percent between 1970 and 1980 alone the president brought taxes down for the first time in years this yearby 4 2 percentin his administrations attempt to bring this country back to economic health interest rates which are driven up by hugh federal deficits are killing people homeowners farmers small businessmeneveryone interest rates are kept high as the government goes into the capital markets to finance itself and then has to go back to the markets for money to pay its interest on the gigantic debt it continues to pile up and saddle on the american people interest rates rose from 6 w percent in 1976 to 21 percent in 1980 the presidents economic recovery is beginning to cause the rates to moderatethey stand around 13 percent and must still be brought down during the freespending years of the 1970s interest rates went up 150 percent they are down 37 2 percent from last year however as we begin to turn the trend toward big government around high interest rates have just about killed average homeowners and made it nearly impossible for young people to buy a home in 1970 when rates were around 8 percent the monthly mortgage payment on a 21 000 loan was only 169 00 by 1980 interest rates had soared to 12 5 percent with such a rate a 48 400 loan now required to buy a priceinflated home resulted in a monthly mortgage payment of 523 69 for 26 years this year that mortgage payment would have been 615 a month we must control spending with a balanced budget amendment to bring these rates down permanently farmers too have been hard hit by interest rates caused by congressional red ink they cannot afford to purchase equipment buy fertilizer and even keep their land to retain their farms in a recent phonein to members of congress sponsored by a major agricultural organization farmers told of how the economy was affecting them seventy fourpercent reported cutbacks in equipment purchases 49 percent were cutting back on fertilizer 42 percent were reducing fuel consumption and 39 percent were buying less pesticides and other chemicals we must not allow federal deficit spending to crush american agriculture it is often argued that a constitutional amendment is unnecessary to achieve budgetary control these critics say that a statutory requirement would be sufficient they are wrong the federal budget control act of 1974 required a balanced budget in 1981 yet there was a deficit of 57 9 billion that year the liberal spenders have already targeted the provision in last years tax bill that requires the indexation of tax rates to eliminate bracket creep big spenders can always repeal statutes what we need is a binding spending limitation i urge my colleagues to join me in working for the relief of americans who are fed up with deficit spending and expect congress to be as responsible with the federal budget as they must be with their own i am hopeful we can achieve swift action on house joint resolution

sacrificed so much for so many in 1944 wallenberg a swedish diplomat was sent to budapest as a result of requests from the american war refugee board and a representative of the world jewish council his mission was to assist jews to escape from the wholesale slaughter being conducted by adolph hitler his mission and the activities he carried out were both daring and successful the swedish raoul wallenberg association has attributed wallenbergs work to directly saving 20 000 hungarian jews in addition he assisted with the collaboration of others in aiding approximately 100 000 jews to escape unfortunately mr wallenberg would never see the success of his work he would never see the children he helped escape grow to adulthood and he would never receive the thanks of a grateful world unfortunately the yoke of oppression that mr wallenberg helped to lift frcm the hungarian people was only fated to be replaced by another form of oppression mr wallenbergs biography reads like a greek tragedy it is a mixture of triumph and tragedy when soviet forces eventually ended the nazi occupation of hungary in january 1944 one of the first actions they took was to arrest wallenberg for suspicion of spying the charges were unfounded and the act unpardonable instead of being hailed as a hero wallenberg was carted off as a common criminal today a mystery surrounds the fate of raoul wallenberg since his incarceration by the soviets 36 years ago after repeated inquires as to his fate the soviets issued a statement claiming mr wallenberg died of a heart attack in 1974 however former prisoners in the soviet gulag system have claimed to have seen a man resembling mr wallenberg during their confinement in 1975 a russian jew jan kaplan met a swede in the butyrka prison who had been imprisoned for 30 years but still seemed healthy if this man is raoul wallenberg then the soviets are once again heinously guilty of repression and the denial of human rights why will the soviets not reveal the real truth about raoul wallenberg how much longer must we accept the lies and falsehoods offered to us by them hopefully the actions we are taking today as representatives of the people of the united states will help clear up the mystery of raoul wallenberg if he is alive after all these years of unnecessary penal servitude then grant him his freedom so that he can live out the

3 years well if you just passed the program and before it even gets into complete effect you have people saying let us get rid of the second or third year let us get rid of the indexing how do you expect our constituents to respond they respond with some skepticism i would suggest to the gentleman that that skepticism is something that we did not fully appreciate we have got to get beyond that

elements who might impede the sovietization of these three countries in the wake of this wholesale terror virtually no baltic family was left untouched by the tragedy the baltic peoples have a rich and cultured history lithuania the largest of the three baltic states was during the middle ages a strong european state whose people protected europe from the mongol and tartar invaders and whose government furnished a power behind which the east slays could live in peace and freedom both latvia and estonia were prosperous states whose deep water ports provided a strong mercantile trade for the many merchants who lived there both the estonian capital of tallinn and the latvian capital of riga were members of the highly prestigous hanseantic league the architecture religion and people of

empire however with the demise of the russian autocaracy during world war i the baltic states found themselves independent and by 1922 were recognized as sovereign states during this short lived period of history baltic culture took on new forms of expresslon and nationalism grew to unprecedented heights however as europe began to gird for world war ii the baltic states found themselves caught between the scissors of nazi agression and soviet communism although espousing heutrality one by one the baltic states were swallowed up by the soviet union the soviet occupation was brutal

malnutrition exposure and disease claimed thousands more during this perilous year it is estimated that 100 000 baltic people were forced to emigrate during the soviet occupation which lasted only 8 days on june 22 1941 the nazis entered the baltic region and began a similar form of repression during their 3year occupation the nazis succeeded in executing or placing into labor camps all baltic people of jewish descent with the decline of germanys power the baltic states returned not to independence but to soviet domination during the second world war and reentrenchment of soviet power the population of the baltic nations was reduced massively by 850 000 or 10 percent we cannot change what has already happened but we can reflect on the inhumanity that men and nations have lowered themselves to so as to reduce the chance for genocide to occur again we must persevere in our struggle against the oppression and inhumanity which is occurring now today marks the 40th anniversary of the baltic tragedy with solemnity i rise with my colleagues to pay tribute to the many lithuanians latvians and estonians whose lives were taken by the hand of oppressors e"], [4.3272972106933594e-05,

made on the need for exploration but it seems to me that this bill reached a reasonable compromise by allowing such exploration to go on in the study areas we have such a small amount of wilderness area and yet the tremendous harm that could be done not necessarily will be done but the kind of exploration which can go on here with respect to the explosives and the intrusion of man into these wilderness areas when there is so litt le land of that available to those vrho really desire to preserve the wildlerness it seems to me the compromise which i understand was a bipartisan compromise reached by the subcommittee seemed to be a very reasonable one so i must rise in opposition let me point out same of the difficulties with specifics it makes little sense to allow any type of seismic activity in wilderness areas without allowing exploratory drilling and the reasons for prohibiting drilling hrve already been discussed at length regardless of the type of seismic exploration employed it is impossible to adequately mitigate fire hazards and wildlife impact even under the method of seismic exploration that is thought to be the least damaging there are grave risks of forest fires typically 50 pounds of explosive is detonated every 150 to 200 feet for several miles or more in order to do the job adequately a surveying crew might construct a grid of crisscrossing lines that is many square miles in size although such a system involves only a small crater around each explosive charge there is also some burning of vegetation since seismic exploration usually occurs during times of good weather this activity clearly represents a serious forest fire risk in addition seismic exploration can have harmful effects on wildlife species many of which are extremely sensitive to human activity not only are explosions disturbing but so are helicopters and other activities associated with seismic exploration i said during general debate on this bill that the reason we are here debating this bill is that the administration has miscaluated by underestimating the importance of wilderness and other environmental issues to the american people we all share the goal of making our nation more energy independent but the amount of oil and gas at issue here is simply not worth the sacrifice of compromising this national commitment to compromising the wilderness character or the recreational value of these lands in summation in opposing this amendment i might say that the explosive potention is so great relative to the fragile ecosystem we are dealing with that we might dub this amendment the nuke the moose amendment"], [4.8100948333740234e-05, 0.5000481009483337, 1, "i will be delighted to enter into a colloquy with the gentlewoman i know she has expressed as some of the members on the post office and civil service committee have expressed some concern with this section the gentlewoman raises some very valid questions and concerns dealing with section 414 the committees intention by including this provision in the bill was twofold the first objective was to place some uniformity upon overtime payments for agencies funded in this bill currently different agencies funded in the bill have varying cutoff points above which overtime is not paid the committee felt these levels should be more uniform and believed that the proviision would accomplish that in addition the limitation would result in not insignificant savings although it is hard to determine precisely the amount of overtime which might be paid to gslos and above in 1982 a rough estimate would be approximately 5 million however let me assure the gentlewoman from ohio and this committee that the appropriations committee did not intend to cause serious problems with this general provision it has come to our attention that the interpretation of certain sections of the fair labor standards act would require revision if the provision is adopted in this form section 213 of that act states that within the government service administrative executive and professional employees are exempt from the overtime provision of the fair labor standards act an office of personnel management regulation details which specific classifications and grades are considered nonexempt under the actand thus due overtime pay for additional work the committees provision as reported in the bill would require certain revisions to that regulation in addition certain people have questioned the effect of the overtime provision on health care within the veterans administration health system and upon responses to disasters under the federal emergency management agency the committee certainly does not intend for the overtime provision to impair in any way va health care or fema disaster relief responses the appropriations committee will review these issues very carefully and make appropriate adjustments in conference with the senate i thank the gentlewoman for her concern in this area"], [6.282329559326172e-05, 0.49993717670440674, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me i strongly oppose the adoption of this legislation if we were debating the merits of this issue before a decision had been made then i believe some of the arguments in favor of h r 6838 might have some validity but the point is the decision has already been made for the house to vote to override the administrations action would only serve to confuse our allies and adversaries as to whos in charge here during the subcommittee hearing on this bill we heard witnesses from previous administrations who believed the congress would be acting correctly by passing this legislation frankly i do not believe those witnesses would have said the same thing if the administration each of them represented had been faced with the same situation americas foreign policy must be represented by one voice and to overturn the presidents decision in this case would not serve our nations interests aside from the principle of the matter i believe the merits of the case demonstrate the president acted correctly in imposing tighter controls on the sale of oil and gas technology to the soviets if you look back at events in 1979 when the soviets invaded afghanistan and in 1981 when they increased pressure on poland thus foreing the establishment of martial law you see reactions from our european allies that were not as significant as those adopted by the unitedstates i believe the reaction was mild because of the europeans close economic and trade ties with the soviets for that reason i am concerned that increased dependence by europe on the soviets as represented by the pipeline would mehn the soviets would have even greater ability to influence european actions whether the presidents actions actually serve to block the construction of the pipeline may be debatable but the decision will unquestionably increase the costs for the soviets and will also have the effect of delaying the time when they would begin earning hard currency from the operation of the pipeline many who oppose the presidents decision on the pipeline argue that it is inconsistent with the decision to sell grain i do not believe it is inconsistent at all the decision on the pipeline denies or at least delays the soviets ability to earn hard currency the sale of grain requires the soviets to use their hard currency to purchase it from the united states in both cases the soviets balance of payments are adversely affected some have questioned the advisability of sanctions altogether yet if you revigw the reports from the soviet union following the invasion of afghanistan the recurring theme is the surprise the soviets felt at the degree of the sanctions imposed following their invasion i believe the soviets view those earlier sanctions plus the threat of sanctions before december 1981 influenced in large part a soviet decision not to invade poland unlike their actions in 1956 in hungary and 1968 in czechoslovakia the application of the sanctions in december and june further served to emphasize to the soviets the costs attached to their aggressive international behavior i am quite sure the soviets view the entire package of sanctionsthose of our allies and our ownas merely the first step of potentially greater sanctions i do not believe the soviets are willing to risk facing additional sanctions from the united states and the west by aggravating the situation in poland if we were to relax our current sanctions without any corresponding movement from the soviets in poland then we would end up encouraging them to maintain their pressure if not increase it i should add also that the aflcio supports the presidents decision on the yamal pipeline despite the hardship for individual workers and companies that union organization believes unitedstates interests are best served by maintaining these sanctions as long as martial law remains in effect political detainees continue to be held and the free trade union movement is suppressed does anyone really believe that legislation removing the sanctions would improve the situation for solidarity moreover recent reports indicate the soviets are using slave labor to build the pipeline this body is on record as consistently deploring the human rights offenses of the soviet union we must not condone the soviets use of slave labor for construction of the pipeline by voting now to make it easier for them to do so also on the issue of extraterritorial reach of unitedstates laws the antiboycott provisions of the export administration act offer effective evidence that extraterritorial extension of unitedstates laws is appropriate and valid before any decision is made on this legislation i believe it is vital to remember that if the house passes this legislation we would not be getting the administration off the hook of a bad decision we would instead be forcing the president to harden his position leaving him no leeway to seek a conciliatory solution to the disagreement that has arisen between the united states and our european allies over the pipeline i am confident the president would resist any effort to elimirate his options in trying to administer the foreign policy of this country i am sure if it came to that point he would veto this legislation and the final result would be only confusion and lack of confidence by our allies in our ability to adopt a policy and stick to it ironically some of the supporters of this legislation to lift sanctions are the same ones who not long ago argued in favor of reimposing sanctions the president had removed i urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation"], [6.824731826782227e-05, 0.4999317526817322, 0, "i thank the gentleman for

all of us who had the pleasure and privilege of serving with him in the 1968 through 1980 sessions lost a valued colleague keith sebelius served his district and our nation extremely well in this house for 12 years he left his mark on many pieces of legislation and earned warm friendships on both sides of the aisle keith sebelius consistently displayed sound judgment in his goals his statements and his actions his actions were very widely noted as being consistent with the best interests and needs of his kansas constituents and the best interests and needs of his country it is not an easy balance to achieve keith sebelius and this member served together on the committee on interior and insular affairs and as members of national park and insular affairs subcommittee during the 96th congress we represented adjacent districts in kansas and nebraska through that period that we served together this firstterm member developed a deep and sincere respect for his knowledge his ability and his leadership that led me to consider him to be one of the most valuable members of the house of representatives there was certainly no member more helpful to me during my first term in congress there was certainly no member whose advice i sought more frequently and he gave itfreely and willingly and i might say he gave it with a great deal of humility keith sebelius brought many fine qualities to this institutionintegrity leadership dedication his contributions in the area of agriculture and national parks were invaluable and will be lasting it is significant that during the week of his death that the interior committees subcommittee on public lands and national parks began markup of the national parks legislation to which he contributed so much insight and energy while keith sebelius made many contributions to agriculture an area in which i relied upon him for advice so often i want to mention a few of his many contributions on the house committee on interior and insular alfairs he had a particular fondness for the national park system and prided himself on the fact that he believed that he had personally visited more of the 333 units of the national park system than had any other member of congress undoubtedly that was true and it gave him an insight which benefited us all during the last 4 years of his congressional career he served as the ranking minority member on this subcommittee and during that time he helped assemble some of the most significant legislative achievements in the history of our national park system that certainly is no exaggeration the most major significant item being the omnibus national parks and recreation act of 1978 something he started called the state of the parks bill which we are now considering and hope to institutionalize while keith made major contributions in assembling and moving key bills to protect specific national park sites around the country he also devised some major generic efforts which have already had wideranging impacts on the entire national park system he authored the section 8 new area studies process which was designed to constitute a professional methodology for systematically identifying and evaluating potential new units for the national park system and reporting on such candidates to the congress that process also embodied further emphasis and visibility for national natural and historic landmarks following that he instituted the inventory and study process to identify and assess ongoing and impending damage and threats to national park system units a survey conducted by the national park service and finally evolving into the state of the parks report issued in may 1980 that report revealed some rather shocking insights into some very troublesome damage and threats affecting our national park system as an outgrowth of that effort the interior committee is currently marking up major legislation to address this very issue i visited with keith during the last year and a half several times on the telephone and wrote him he continued his interest in what we were doing in the many areas that had been his concern for so long keith sebelius served his state and his country with distinction and respect he brought honor and dignity to his position we are all better because he was here i share with my colleagues the sense of loss may god comfort his family his wife betty his sons gary and doug his brothers and sisters those of us who knew him and worked with him will always remember him fondly we will sorely miss him in conclusion i would like to say that we in the great plains were and are proud of keith sebelius he epitomizes what we like to think are some of the best characteristics of our region and our people in the words of the popular ballad he was a big big man he possessed an uncommon degree of commonsense he approached his job in the unitedstates house of representatives with integrity high principle and good will
