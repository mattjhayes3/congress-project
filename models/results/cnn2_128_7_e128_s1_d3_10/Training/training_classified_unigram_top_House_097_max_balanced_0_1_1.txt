"there are major items in this legislation such as indexation which should be considered separately for that reason i would vote against the previous question there is no question in my mind that if we are successful in providing for indexing of personal tax rates we will have accomplished the most significant change in tax laws in at least 40 years both republicans and democrats are committed to a tax cut to allow all taxpayers to provide forward momentum for the economy any tax cut must allow all citizens to realize greater purchasing power from their paychecks this is especially true in these periods of unpredictable leaps in inflation rates and in interest rates a tax indexation amendment will allow us to keep individual tax rates stable if we are successful we will not be confronted with the periodic adh 5126 co justment of personal tax rates that the congress goes through an adjustment that at best for a short period of time allows the taxpayer to barely break even in the war against inflation the members of this house know that this is not a new proposal the senate in a strong bipartisan vote has already approved a finance committee amendment establishing indexation of personal tax rates for inflation we know that a similar provision exists in the proposed republican substitute it is my opinion that if we fail to add indexation to the ways and means bill one that i consider superior to the republican substitute we may be confronted with tax policy that fails millions of taxpayers in this country in a new study by the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations in the nine statesarizona california colorado iowa minnesota montana oregon south carolina and wisconsinthat use indexing there was greater tax equity the reason is that indexing helps lowincome taxpayers who are most hurt by unindexed exemptions and standard deductions furthermore it strengthens fiscal discipline more carefully most importantly in fiscal year 1979 states with indexing averaged a 15 3 percent increase in revenues due to economic growth the labor department reported that for an urban family of four in 1979 an income of 20 000 was needed to experience an intermediate standard of living in 1980 that figure was then 23 000 the largest increase in living costs for this family was the 25 percent jump in federal and state income taxes business week magazine reports that a family with an income of 30 000 pays 18 3 percent of those earnings in federal income tax and social security with no tax relief by 1984 that taxation rate will increase to 22 5 percent a family that earns 10 000 will have a junp from 9 9 percent to 13 9 percent during that same period the 50 000 a year family will experience a percentage increase from the federal government taxation policies from 21 8 to 26 8 percent if we were to index personal income tax rates for the next 2 years the tax reduction would most closely resemble the tax decreases proposed by the ways and means committeeexcluding reductions to offset social security tax increases if as a tax indexation amendment we begin indexing at the end of the tax cut period we are simply

consideration i regret that this is so because i am acutely aware of the fact that the financial markets in this country are waiting anxiously to see if the congress will find the discipline and the willpower to control federal spending and deficits the fate of investment decisions which are critical to the economic recovery of our private sector and the nation hinges on what we do two weeks ago during the first round of budget resolution votes i voted for two budgets the aspin coalition substitute and the unamended house budget committee bill the coalition budget was my first choice it was the handiwork primarily of five moderate democrats and five moderate republicans including myself known as the gang of ten for several weeks we met in an effort to find the common denominators which could attract members of both parties and which could leave behind the partisan posturing which had character ized negotiations to that point of the three major budget blueprints before the house at that time it had the lowest fiscal year 1983 deficit under 100 billion by our estimates and the largest 3year deficit reduction figure when the coalition budget was defeated in a second effort to see a resolution adopted i voted for the house budget committee bill in unamended forra even though i was far from pleased with it what happened in the final analysis is history after debating 8 budgets and considering some 67 amendments the house voted everything down it is ironic to me that after this debacle no real attempt was made to find a middle ground at the request of the steering committee for the group of moderate republicans known as the gypsy moths i participated in the negotiations on the new republican substitute latta ii i approached these sessions in good faith my goal was to get the republican leadership to agree to funding restorations in enough key program areas to insure moderate republican support for the final product and adoption of that plan by the full house other participants in the bargaining meetings were representatives of the reagan administration the boll weevils or southern democrats and the yellow jackets or conservative republicans i made clear that i could not accept some of the program cuts that had been included in latta i and many of the new proposals for cuts over and above latta i that were on the table for discussion i recommended that the revision draft be modified so that an additional 3 billion in defense savings be achieved and an additional 2 2 billion in revenues be raised bringing the revenue total more in line with the senate budget revenue figure with the total 5 2 billion freed up in this manner i suggested the following redistribution scheme 737 million to function 500 to bring education spending into line with the simon amendment to latta i 1 1 billion to function 270 to protect the energy programs important to the northeast 2 5 billion to function 550 to guard against undue benefit reductions for medicare recipients 700 million to function 600 for the food stamp and wic programs and 127 million to function 600 for unemployment compensation i felt certain that this reordering of priorities within the general latta budget framework would produce a plan acceptable to the gypsy moths and to the house as a whole unfortunately instead of moving toward the middle of the political spectrum over my protests the negotiators move further to the right although 1 7 billion of the latta i medicare cut was restored largely in view of the overwhelming votes on the oakar amendments and although most of the necessary unemployment compensation funds were restored my other recommendations were ignored and deeper cuts were made in new areas for example disregarding the will of the house as expressed on the simon amendments to latta i jones i and aspin the negotiators not only failed to add back any education funding to the latta i levels they decided to cut an additional 400 million 304 million of this extra reduction is attributable to technical reestimates which have yet to be specified or explained at the same time this was occurring the democrats in their revised budget were moving further to the left they come to us now with an unacceptably high deficit the net result is that the objectionable features of both original proposals have been worsened rather than improved upon returning to the latta ii blueprint it is interesting to note that this budget poses a serious threat to president reagans new federalism proposal which is presently under negotiation between the states and the administration i say this after having spoken with richard snelling governor of vermont and chairman of the national governors association and a party to these negotiations as members will recall the president in his state of the union address in january suggested that the federal government take over the state share of medicaid payments for the poor while the states take over the federal share of the aid to families with dependent children afdc program plus the food stamp program currently completely federally run after considerable criticism of this idea by the states the administration modified it so that uncle sam would continue to run food stamps now under a national medicaid program certain individuals presently eligible for assistance under liberal state plans such as the vermont system would no longer be eligible we are therefore confronted with the likelihood that with a national program states like vermont would have to pull in the slack with some sort of supplemental medical benefits program latta ii would exacerbate this situation by putting into effect a real reduction in medicald in fiscal year 1982 the program level is 17 82 billion in outlays under latta ii it would be 17 67 billion more slack to pull in the same problem would exist for the food stamp afdc portion of the new federalism latta ii would fund the food stamp program at 10 5 billion in fiscal year 1983excluding the puerto rican part of the program the 1982 level is 10 6 billion reduced food stamp benefits next year under new federalism would mean additional state expenditures for their afdc programs we all know that a good number of states have been using the food stamp program to subsidize their shares of the afdc program for years by setting low afdc benefit levels with the latta ii food stamp cut we could see the roles reversed here the states that would be hardest hit would be those who had the most liberal eligibility criteria particularly in a state like vermont which already has a very high tax effort we will be hard pressed to generate the necessary new revenues we rank near the bottom in terms of per capital personal income and out state and local taxes as a percent of adjusted personal income have been as high as 12 31 percent let me turn to some other areas of the budget where i feel that latta ii has a serious funding shortfall all told latta i reduced funding for the core entitlement programs for the poor by roughly 8 billion over 3 years latta ii slashes them by nearly 18 billion for the food stamp program latta ii cuts much more than the reductions contained in legislation introduced earlier this year by senator dole in introducing his bill senator dole pointed out that his 1983 reduction of 750 million was as far as congress could go without causing serious harm to the needy the latta ii 1983 food stamp cut is 1 3 billion for subsidized housing latta ii provides only 7 4 billion in outlays next year and actually has a negative 5 billion in budget authority representing a 22 6 billion cut from the jones budget i think the transportation function is also seriously underfounded with fiscal year 1983 outlays of only 20 billion mr latta proposes to cut back on interstate transfers which will have serious implications for vermont which has used interstate money to fund important primary and secondary projects latta ii also provides a low funding level for amtrak which could jeopardize the montrealer two additional points the latta defense budget is far too high latta ii cuts defense a mere 300 million more than latta i this token gesture is not sufficient the aspin coalition budget provided a 5 percent real increase for defense in 1983 over 1982 and this level of funding was more than adequate latta ii provides a 7 percent real increase i want to point out that our defense adequacy will be determined by readiness not by some dollars and cents relation to defense spending by soviet bloc countries the pentagon has yet to come up here to the hill and present us with a cogent comprehensive plan of where it thinks threats to our national security around the world will be in years to come and what combination of weapons systems will be needed to meet those threats we will not insure security simply by throwing money at the pentagon the latta ii defense figures will be inflationary will create industrial bottlenecks and will hamper the productivity of our private sector finally although the deficit figure for fiscal year 1983 under the latta plan is somewhat appealing it is also beguiling i think there has been some legerdemain used in arriving at the 99 3 billion figure and i think we will see that number grow in actuality to well over 100 billion if we adopt this plan while this country urgently needs a budget from the house of representatives it does not need nor will it be well served by the latta ii budget we need a plan that balances the need for a strong defense with our legitimate social needs we need a plan which balances the need to reduce spending and taxes and keep the deficit down with our duty to honor commitments to certain basic rights for all americans the
