simply contend that the level at which we are now paid 77 000 is a reasonable level of compensation a couple of questions came to my mind during yesterdays hearing one of those questions was how long has it been since you or i have seen a member of the congress the house or the senate step down during midterm because we were insufficiently paid i might also add how long has it been since we have had an open seat a vacant seat either midterm or at the end of a term that went unfilled because democrats and republicans were unwilling to run for the position because we thought the pay was too low i cannot recall that nor can i think any of you recall instances where that actually did occur let me just say that what i think we should do is vote to raise our pay commensurate with the increases we provide to all federal employees last year we froze their pay similarly we froze our pay this year we provided a 3 percent pay increase for federal employees this year we provided the same for ourselves i think that is a good model for us to follow and would suggest that we do that we have a long way to go to reach our deficit reduction target for next year we are clearly going to be above our target for this year i do not see a ground swell of support coming up on either side of the aisle here to raise taxes as a result we are going to have to focus on spending and to the extent we are

of the end for the contras if we abandon the freedom fighters in nicaragua it is the beginning of the end of freedom for not only the people of nicaragua but for central america we can debate for a period of weeks whether the united states should have been involved in providing aid to those who oppose communism in nicaragua we could go into exhaustive pros and cons as to whether such aid should have taken place or what its terms should have been but the time for this is long past we have been and we are providing such aid and i submit to the members there are two key pledges we owe our constituents and the country as we debate providing further aid the first is that not one group of people anywhere in the world should be left in the lurch by the united states since world war ii literally millions of peopleboth as nations and as ethnic groups have allied themselves with us only to be abandoned ask the hungarians or the people of the baltic states or some of the kachin tribes of burma or the meo or montagnards of souheast asia or the kurdsask them whether they wished that they had listened to american blandishments implying assistance in helping them gain their peace and freedom we can no longer allow our country to be a fairweather friend once embarked on a course where other people are at risk we must discpline ourselves to follow through to victory the second thing we owe ourselves is not to create conditions where our worst fears become our only national option in el salvador the democratically elected government is defending itself with minimal united states participation there are only 55 unitedstates trainers allowed in the country and the sandinistas have been so busy countering their own resistance and revolutionaries that their stated goals of exporting marxist revolution from nicaragua to their neighbors have been frustrated lets not allow them to achieve their goals by reneging on our promise to the freedom fighters we cannot be seen to be a fickle and inconsistent ally the people of el salvador nicaragua honduras and costa rica deserve better than that as do the people of the united states despite the investigations which are presently under way there are certain facts which are as true today as they were a year ago 6 months ago nothing has changed insofar as the problemsand potentially worse problemsin central america are concerned nicaragua remains a marxist state and the sandinistas remain determined to continue consolidation of their hold on this nation which has already suffered far too much they continue to foment trouble in neighboring countries they continue to proclaim their unity with eastern bloc nations and they continue to be a threat to democracy in central and south america and even to north american states i plead with all our colleagues present today that they not permit their good judgment and better instincts to be clouded by what may have happened half a world away let us instead view

from our own southern border we cannot sacrifice anyone else any further group who is allied with us in the name of freedom it disturbs me greatly to hear the repeated allegations that the freedom fighters cannot win this is the same kind of attitude that was being displayed 2 years ago in trying to scuttle the democratically elected government in el salvador all we heard then was that it made no sense to help the el salvadoreans because quote everybody knew that the marxist guerrillas would win while were standing here debating this resolution there are over 10 000 freedom fighters in small infiltration teams operating over onehalf of the area of nicaragua they have recently shot down a soviet hind helicopter the most feared weapon provided to the marxists by the cubans and the soviets all they need from us in order to win is encouragement and equipment i am strongly opposed to communism and will therefore vote against this resolution i would ask my colleagues if it makes

preceded it from this administration comes at a time when a peace process is underway when it suits the purposes of this administration proponents of contra aid routinely invoke respect for our democratic allies in central america then when those allies painstakingly set forth on a path toward a negotiated settlement we tell them that they have vastly underestimated the threat posed by the sandinistas and the effectiveness of the contras those who say that communists never negotiate overlook president reagans recent negotiation of the inf treaty and the fact that we can do business with our adversaries whether in moscow havana or managua when it is in our interest and the interest of democratic nations to do so there is a risk in voting to disapprove this request the risk is that the sandinistas may renege on the concessions they made two weeks ago in san jose they may reimpose the state of emergency they so recently lifted they may unilaterally violate the terms of any eventual cease fire they may resort to the widespread imprisonment of the civilian opposition but the risk of ignoring the peace process is greater we know for certain that the provision of aidno matter how it is packagedwill cause the process to fail what will our policy be then for the 6 years that the contra war has been fought this administration has continually declared that our goal is a democratic nicaragua but the prospect of real reform by the sandinista directorate has invariably led to efforts to undermine or subvert any progress toward regional discussions of the shape of elections and the restoration of civil liberties we should be skeptical about the sandinistas concessions they have shown every willingness to bankrupt the population of nicaragua and to deplete the treasury with the threat of an invasion of united states troops but we have also given our neighbors in central america so many reasons to be skeptical about our own motives whatever became of the kissinger commission recommendations in the area of economic development whatever happened to the initial welcoming of initiatives in the areas of education health housing and literacy for the other central american
