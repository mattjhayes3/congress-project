bipartisan health bill this year we believe it is possible to write a bill on a bipartisan basis possibly starting with the rowlandbilirakis bill which has 35 republicans and 35 democrats cosponsoring it certainly building on that and developing a bill which is market oriented which has insurance reform which has group insurance for small business which has malpractice reform which has a number of steps that most americans agree with we began working on the house republican side in july 1991 when congressman michel our leader founded the house republican task force on health that was back when president bush was still president we have been working now for virtuallr 3 years on how to write i a heilth reform bill we have offered to the democratic leadership to work on a bipartisan health reform bill i as very disappointed to see the artidle in the new york times today gop in the house trying to block health care bill because i think that article is just plain factually wrong the article begins which i might say was the key part of this that house republicans are trying to keep health care legislation from reaching the house floor in a form that could pass that paragraph is just plain factually wrong what we are trying to do is to write on a bipartisan basis a health reform bill that world strengthen the american peoples access to health insurance that would keep their control over their doctor and their hospital and their choice that would not kill millions of jobs that would not crush small business that would not raise taxes that would nothave big bureaucracy and big regulation and that would not centralize power in washington it is true we are opposed to the clinton health plan we believe the clinton health plan is big government big bureaucracy big taxation we believe the clinton health plan takes control over your health care away from you and gives it to the washington bureaucracy i want to say up front we are opposed to the clinton health plan we believe that the bill currently in the committee on ways and means by the democratic leadership is essentially a new version of the clinton health plan now it is a sad time but the committee on ways and means democrats have been playing very clever games there are members of the ways and means democrats who cannot vote for a tobacco tax increase because they are from a state which grows tobacco such as virginia there are members of the ways and means democrats who cannot really vote to kill jobs and small business with mandates because they are from places like omaha ne and michigan so what they have done is they have created a fiction an excuse they have said the house republicans are forcing us to vote for these things we are really not for them but the house republicans are forcing us to do it if you are going to be a clinton clone and you are going to do what clinton wants then i think you should stand up and be honest with your district i am prepared to go to any district in the country and debate the merits of crushing small business and killing jobs i am prepared to go to any district in the country and debate whether or not you need a tax increase to pay for a health system that is already too expensive and ought to become less expensive however far more important than the debate over specific issues or the effort by the clinton clones to avoid being responsible for their votes by blaming house republicans for scaring them into doing it far more important is this message to the american people house republicans are reaching out to any individual democrat with the courage to work wthus on ab ipartisan basisto write a marketoriented gropp ansaraince for small business relieve hospitals from antitrust so they can buy expensive equipment intelligently have malpractice reform to lower cost offer tax fairness to individuals selfemployed and to the unemployed and to family farms we believe that with medical savings accounts and with other good ideas that we can work with individual democrats to put together a bipartisan package we applaud those democrats who have had the courage for example in the rowlandbilirakis bill 35 of them to cosponsor a bipartisan bill we also want to reach out to the democratic leadership i have personally on four occasions told the democratic majority leader that we would like to work with them to write a bipartisan bill what we cannot do is we cannot help pass the clinton big government big bureaucracy big tax increase antijobs antismall business antiindividual control over their own health bill i think sometimes when the democratic leadership gets frustrated and when it gets excited and it says republicans dont want to pass anything that is because they define the clinton plan as the only thing the fact is in the mostrecent gallop poll over 50 percent of the american people now reject the clinton health plan because over 50 percent of the american people do not want washington to run their hospital to control their doctor to decide on their medicine to take control away from them over their own life i just wanted to come to the floor today at the end of the week to say when we come back on monday i hope there can be some bipartisanship from the democratic leadership i hope the president will be willing to engage in bipartisanship and i hope they will quit trying to pass a

restore democracy in haiti that is important to our national interests and by pro hibiting by law any operational command by nonunitedstates troops we should reject the michel substitutes position to force a hasty withdrawal how can we expect other nations to participate in efforts to create regional stability if we cut and run we cannot we must work with the international community and the u n to
