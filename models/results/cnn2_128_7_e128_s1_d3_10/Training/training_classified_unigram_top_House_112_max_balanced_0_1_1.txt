black caucus budget came up i think mr mulvaney came up with a budget proposal they put the presidentsa very very watered down and inaccurate version of the presidents budget up there and weve been talking budget when we talk about the budget what were talking about is the values and priorities of america its important to keep this in mind what shows up in your budget is what you care about what does not show up in your budget is what you dont care about now i always caution people not to just take their family budget and the united states budget and assume theyre basically the same thing one just is bigger than the other thats not exactly accurate there are important differences and we shouldnt mix up the two but in this way they are similar in that they reflect what it is that people value if you have a family and their budget you can look at their budget they spend a lot of money on entertainment you can pretty much figure they value that if they put a lot of money into food you can figure they definitely think that is a priority for them you can go through the family budget and see what people spend their money on see what people dont have in their budget and then you can pretty much figure well maybe thats not a priority for them of course they may not be able to afford it at this time but if you talk about reasonably middle class people their budget reflects what they care about what matters and what doesnt and for our nation that certainly is true if our nation puts more money into warfare than it does into social uplift jobs and the economy and infrastructure that says something about who we are if our national budget puts more money into infrastructure and jobs and putting people back to work then that says something about who we are the various budgets that have come up reflect what the various caucuses think is important and project a vision for our country i want to talk about that today i want to start by talking about paul ryans budget paul ryan is the republican budget committee chair hes a nice guy i dont have anything bad to say about him personally because he is actually a nice person but the fact is we disagree in a significant way about what the priorities of america should be for example the republican budget 20 children will lose access to head start to pay for one millionaires tax cut thats their budget just if you want to understand what their tax cuts represent it means 20 kids dont get to go to head start so that a millionaire can get a tax cut150 000 equals 20 times 7 500 so if you look at this tax cut a millionaires tax cut which will amount to about 150 000 these little guys dont get to go to head start now what is head start head start is a great program for lowincome kids to make sure that they have a chance at getting a quality education and dont fall behind in school and so this is a great program it has great results these head start kids 20 of them going to head start versus what a millionaires tax cut would be which is 150 000 now this is the choice were making we should not act like were not making choices we are making choices we are deciding my friends on the republican side of the aisle like to say oh we shouldnt pick winners and losers were always doing it they just pick the rich people and weipick the kids in head start also if you just want to get a sense of what the republican budget what it does and what the tax cuts that its calling for mean republican budget 150 college students will have their pell grants cut by 1 000 to pay for one millionaires tax cut so one millionaires tax cut 150 000 but 150 times 1 000 all these kids these college kids trying to make something of themselves their pell grant is going to get whacked by 1 000 bucks so again choices do we want to make sure the country club set is doing even better or do we want to make sure that these aspiring engineers these aspiring doctors and teachers these aspiring police officers these aspiring workers of tomorrow will have a shot at an affordable college education this is what were talking about these are the choices that were making and i think its very important that americans know it its critical that we know it now lets just not stop there lets talk about other critical choices being made because i think it is so critical that as were talking budget week and all the budget decisions that we are making that we make it real clear to the american people what it is were choosing republican budget 216 pregnant or postpartum women infants and children would lose access to wicthats the women infants and children program and it provides food for poor women and their kidsto pay for one millionaires tax cut so 150 000 tax cut for a millionaireagain this is the country club setequals about 216 pregnant women or postpartum women and the amount of money that americans give them so that they can have good nutrition for their kids these are poor women these are women who are struggling economically but just because theyre struggling economically we dont want their kids to go without good nutritious food so as americans we have the wic program well theyre going to get slashed out of the program because a millionaire needs a tax cut thats the choice that were making i want to talk about why were making that choice in a minute but i want to give one more example republican budget 25 seniors paying 6 000 or more for medicare to pay for one millionaires tax cut so if youre a millionaire and you get a tax cut under what the republicans want to give youyoure already doing good but they want you to even do betterthat will mean that youve got about 25 seniors who have to pay 6 000 a piece more for their medicare so mom dadif youre my age mom and dad are senior citizens if youre younger theyre not but if your parents or grandparents are on medicare and theyre doing all they can on their fixed income to make it theyre going to need a little extra help because weve got to make sure that that millionaire gets his 150 000 tax cut these are the choices that were making now my friends in the republican caucusgod bless themits not like they dont like poor people many of them are very charitable they give in their different walks of life maybe their faith community or whatever they just dont think government should do it this is what they say they think that government needs to get out of that and let churches mosques synagogues and other folks do it of course that would mean that it wouldnt get done because even though churches mosques and synagogues do great work they can never possibly come up to meet the need thats out there what theyre really believing isthis is what they really believe they believe in something called trickledown economics they believe that if you give this millionaire 150 000 more dollars than he already has he will maybe hopefully perhaps invest it in plant and equipment and maybe somebody will get a job because of it or maybe not or maybe he will invest in china hell improve jobs but just not in america nobody knows what they will do with this tax cut but this is what the republicans believe they think that if you give rich people more money they will invest in plant and equipment create more economic activity and it will trickle down to the rest of us the only problem is that it has never worked it doesnt stop them from saying it but its never worked in fact the gop budget will destroy more than 4 million american jobs in the next 2 years according to the economic policy institute the economic policy institute estimates that the shock to aggregate demand from nearterm spending cuts would result in roughly 1 3 million jobs lost in 2013 and 2 8 million jobs lost in 2014 or 4 1 million jobs through so a little bit more than 4 million jobs over the next 2 years now people might think well keith is that right well yeah its right and ill tell you why its right its right because when republicans say we need to cut government waste we need to cut government cut government cut government they act as if theres just some big government thing over there like its a big giant piece of styrofoam and they can just cut it and it doesnt change anything what theyre talking about cutting are federal workers theyre talking about laying off federal workers and theyre very derisive about government jobs and act like people who work for the government dont do anything of valueof course this is not true at all but if you look on this chart right here it says i earn less than 45 000 a year explain to me gop how cutting my pay creates jobs this particular person is named paul and he is an army depot worker i think we need army depot workers teresa is a nurseand this is her right here she lives in my district and she says twelve percent of the salary i earn caring for veterans goes to my retirement explain to me gop how cutting my retirement puts people to work well one of the things that they do in the ryan budget is cut into federal workers retirement they act like oh the government no the government is people the government is nurses the government is army depot workers and what about federal prisons that keep dangerous criminals behind bars i pay more than 9 000 a year for my familys health insurance explain to me gop how cutting my takehome pay lowers unemployment this guy is a corrections officer and thank goodness for correction officers or the streets that we live on wouldnt be so nice the bottom line is when republicans say oh were going to shrink the size of government what they mean is theyre going to lay off and cut the pay and cut the employment benefits of federal workers people who work in prisons at risk to themselves nurses who care for our veterans people who are army depot workers and people who work in our parks and people who fix our roads and a whole lot of other people heres a chart for you if you look at the ryan budget if you look at the gop proposal if you look at it and it could do what they want it to do it could cause a loss of up to 7 million jobs by 2016 because it would cut federal workers and then they wouldnt be able to have the money to spend in the neighborhoods they live in anymore that would then have a ripple effect in their neighborhoods because theyre buying less for example if that young nurse at the va in minnesota if she doesnt have the same pay as she had before then she cant buy as much as she bought before then the company she shops at doesnt sell her as much as they have before you do that enough multiply it times enough people and that company then needs to start laying off people so its a ripple effect what the republicans are asking for but if you look at what they wantedand im talking about going all the way back to h r 1 which is their proposalyou would see repealing health care reform that would cut about 2 million the gop budget that would cut about 3 million cuts to the federal workforce that would cut about 285 000 the socalled jobs act that would cut a lot the fair tax that would cut and they would just cut on down the line what theyre basically proposing is by shrinking government and by doing all that stuff theyre getting rid of people now i just want to be on the record because your words do get twisted if there is a federal program that is not justifiable and its so poorly run that its of no value to anyone im okay with cutting it i just want to say that on the record on the house floor im all right with cutting programs that dont work but when youre talking about va nurses and youre talking about corrections workers in federal prisons we need these people they do good stuff and i believe that we should stand by them as they stand by us the gop budgetnow going back to the budget we addressed todaywill shift costs to seniors for the medicare guarantee according to the aarp and whats aarp thats the leading organization representing retired persons and the cbowhats the cbo that is the congressional budget office and for folks who like to watch cspan id just say you need to know what cbo is because this is very important congressional budget office theyre the nonpartisan group that says whats really going on with the numbers at the same time it is raising the seniors cost this gop budget gives those making more than a million a year an average tax cut of about 394 000 so i put 150 up there a moment ago that was the generic millionaire the actual number is about 394 for the average millionaire per year on the average tax cut and also the tax breaks for big oil companies you know they get about 4 billion a year im talking about if you look at conoco exxonmobil and all the big oil companies they get about 4 billion a year now how much did you pay for gasoline im not saying that theyre not good people im not saying that they dont run a good business and supply an important product im just asking you this does exxonmobil really need your money through a tax subsidy do they i think that they dont need your money i think their 4 a gallon is taking care of them just fine and i think its outrageous that the republican budget that we dealt with does not eliminate that tax break in short the big oil companies who are gouging americans at the pump and the wealthiest americans win while middle class and working class families get the short end of the stick last year oil profitsand this is an exact number or close to it last year big oil profits totaled about 137 billion but you dont need to remember 137 billion all you need to remember is big oil profits were the biggest ever that the oil industry ever had and yet were forking it over to them through our tax money not through the pumps some people might think well of course were paying them keith through the pump they give us gas weve got to get to work so we need to buy the gas im not talking about that im saying they getthey can apply for grants and subsidies and it all adds up to about 4 billion a year with soaring gasoline prices big oils 2012 profits will even be bigger yet republicans want to give big oil more money in our tax dollars and it just doesnt make any sense now of course you shouldnt expect the big oil companies like exxonmobil to say we dont want the money of course they want the money who doesnt want money everybody does including them but the people who have a public responsibility to look out for the american people should be willing to say no to public subsidies for the exxonmobils of this world and again if you work for exxonmobil im not running you down im just saying that youre doing well enough and you dont need the help of the american people you can do fine on your own now those kids on head start need help they need help those college kids need help but not exxonmobil executives the major consequence for medicare and medicaid the ryan budget the republican budget has big consequences for medicaid and medicare many seniors will be forced to pay sharply higher premiums to stay in traditional medicare and keep their current choice of doctors new medicare beneficiaries would pay more than 1 200 more by 2030 and more than 6 000 by 2050 before more seniors would gradually shift to private health insurance plans over time increasing privatization of medicare more than 47 million americans would lose health care insurance over 10 years because they would get rid of obamacare now my friends in the republican aisle when they say obamacare they dont mean it in a nice way its an insult but you know what obama does care so i dont mind them saying obamacare i hope they keep saying it because theyre just reminding americans that obama cares about them and that the people the republicans want to look out for apparently do not states under the republican plan would be forced to slash medicaid eligibility benefits and payments to health care providers their budget shreds the medicaid safety net and shifts health care costs to states and beneficiaries blocking medicaid this shifts all risks including future recessions health care cost increases and disasters to states and beneficiaries so heres the thing this ryan budget this republican ryan budget it helps and takes care of the rich it ignores everyone else and it hurts the middle class the republican budget would weaken the middle class in important ways first and foremost their plan ends the medicare guarantee of decent health insurance in retirement it also slashes critical middle class investments such as education and infrastructure by 45 percent and 24 percent respectivelyeducation by 45 percent infrastructure by 24 percent now look the american society of civil engineers has told us that we have crumbling infrastructure in this country to the tune of about 2 2 to 3 trillion a lot of money and if you are living in any city across this country you can drive over 75yearold bridges you can drive over potholes our sewage systems need upgrade i am from minneapolis minnesota a city i love so much but back a few years ago we had a bridge fall into the mississippi river because the gusset plates which are those plates that hold up the bridge gave way because the adequate maintenance just wasnt maintained over time now it happened to us but it could happen anywhere there are many structurally deficient bridges across this nation literally thousands we could put people back to work if we put the money into taking care of them and not only would we have people working wed have to save bridges to go over but the republican majority to use their phrase kicks the can down the road and doesnt deal with this looming infrastructure crisis so let me just say this ive talked a little bit about the socalled ryan republican budget i dont want to spend all my time talking about it but i do think its important for americans to know that this is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for people whove got it well who are doing fine now let me just tell you i swear i am a big fan of welltodo people i wish i were one of them but my point is that you dont need to help people who already have a lot of help on their own but you do need to help schoolkids head start kids pregnant moms pregnant lowincome moms seniors these people we should help people who are doing fine they dont need our help they should do the helping in my opinion and yet the ryan budget says were just going to help the country club set and i think thats not any way to have a budget im going to talk about the progressive caucus budget but i just want you to know first that the ryan republican budget is no good budget for america in fact its premised on the theory that rich people dont have enough money and poor people have too much really thats the animating organizing feature of their budget that if we gave rich people more money then they might invest it in plant and equipment and then itll trickle down to the rest of us and poor people have too much stuff we cant afford it we cant afford head start cant afford wic cant afford home heating oil for seniors cant afford medicare cant afford medicaid the poor folks are just theyre getting treated too well and thats basically what the theory is of the republican budget and so thats fine and i respect them for being real honest about what they believe in because a budget is a reflection of our values so now that weve talked about what theyre talking about lets talk about a real budget not for the 1 percent but a budget for all the progressive caucus budget has a name the name of the progressive caucus budget is the budget for all thats the name of the progressive caucus budget because unlike the republicans budget which is a budget for the 1 percent this is a budget for all let me tell you what it does it creates 3 3 million jobs in the first 2 years it cuts the deficit by nearly 7 trillion 6 8 trillion no benefit cuts to medicare medicaid and social security the budget for all makes the american dream a reality again for the vast majority of americans by putting americans back to work the budget for all enhances our economic competitiveness by rebuilding the middle class and investing in innovation and education our budget protects medicare and medicaid social security invests in americas future and asks those who have benefited the most from our economy to pay their fair share now as i said you cant have a budgetyou can have a budget that cuts taxes for rich people if you then cut services for poor people and you can have a budget that pays for infrastructure and education but the money has to come from somewhere and we ask people who already have lots of it to do a little more for their fellow americans were not hiding that fact yes we would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans not to punish them because we dont think taxes are punishment but because its necessary to meet the needs of the nation and any selfrespecting patriot would do so if they could in fact there is a group out thereand i would urge you to check them out mr speakercalled patriotic millionaires who understand that they may need to pay higher taxes if you already are making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that lowincome pregnant women got some food for their kids if you are already making a million or more a year would you pay a little extra to make sure that little kids had head start to go to if youre already making a million dollars a year would you pay a little extra just to make sure that the federal workers dont have their pensions cut to pay for your tax cut thats just my thinking i dont want anybody to think the republicans are mean they do charitable work in their individual lives and thats a fact and i think people ought to know that but they dont think government has any role in helping people i disagree with that and call on americans to look carefully at the choices that they offer the budget for all is not a budget for the 1 percent its not a budget for the 99 percent but a budget for all because we care about the 1 percent too we want even the 1 percent to live in a good nation with fairness with economic opportunity with economic mobility with good roads good bridges good education clean water clean air we want this for everyone the budget for all attacks americas persistently high unemployment levels with more than 2 4 trillion over 10 years in jobcreating investment this plan utilizes every tool at the governments disposal to get our economy moving again including directhire programs that create school improvement corps park improvement corps student jobs corps and others targeted tax incentives that spur clean energy manufacturing cuttingedge technological investment in the private sector widespread domestic investment including an infrastructure bank a 556 billion surface transportation unlike this thing that they tried to pass today which is a 3month extension by the way can you believe it the republican caucus is always going on and on about uncertainty what did they do they created uncertainty by passing some 3month transportation bill my goodness it boggles the mind actually back to the budget for all there is approximately 1 7 trillion in widespread domestic investment unlike the republican budget the budget for all substantially reduces the deficit and does so in a way that does not devastate what americans value we achieve these notable benchmarks by focusing on the true drivers of our deficit unsustainable tax policy wars overseas and the policies that helped cause the recent recession rather than putting the middle class and the social safety net on the chopping block the budget creates a fairer america it ends tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans on schedule at the years end extends tax relief for middle class households and the vast majority of americans creates new tax brackets for millionaires and billionaires in line with the buffett rule principle eliminates tax code preferential treatment for capital gains and dividends abolishes corporate welfare for oil gas and coal companies eliminates loopholes that allow businesses to dodge their true tax liability creates a publicly funded federal election system that gets corporate money out of politics for good it responsibly and expeditiously ends our military presence in afghanistan leaving america more secure at home and abroad it also adapts our military to address 21st century threats through modernization the department of defense will spend less and stop contributing to the deficit but they will have what they need to keep america strong which is very important to all of us it provides a makingworkpay tax credit for families struggling with high gas and food costs extends an earned income tax credit and child dependent care credit invests in programs to stave off further foreclosure invests in childrens education by increasing education training and social services the budget for all is a budget for all i know that sounds repetitive but

democrats and republicans the one part of the option that should not be on the table is to allow us to pass august 2 without raising the debt limit let me talk about the consequences i have said i believe they are catastrophic consequences and i do believe that we know it is likelyalmost certainthat the rating houses will downgrade americas currency from the most secure currency in the world we would be downgraded we run a real risk as to whether the dollar will continue to be the global currency right now many international transactions are related in dollars we know that as it relates to energy all of a sudden on august 3 we run the risk that the american dollar will no longer be the global currency having a major impact on the unitedstates economy j p morgan tells us we could expect an immediate increase in interest costs of 75 to 100 basis points what does that mean well for the taxpayers of this country it means it is going to cost more money for us to pay for our borrowing that will raise the cost of interest payments which i would suggest is a not very productive use of taxpayer dollars causing taxpayers to have to pay more for our borrowing but it goes well beyond the federal taxpayers it affects every family in america the estimates are that the effect of the increase in unitedstates obligations on interest rates will have an effect on all borrowing so if a person is buying a home they can expect the interest costs will increase by about 1 000 a year if a person is a credit card holder they can expect their interest rates to go up about 250 a year that is the effect it is going to have on every american family if we pass august 2 without increasing our debt limit if a person has money in the stock market they can expect there will be a reduction in the value of their wealth we saw that happen once before when retirement account values slipped dramatically we are at risk of having that happen again if we pass august 2 without increasing the debt limit the impact it will have on our economy on jobswe expect it will clearly have a negative impact on our job market we will lose jobs and we very well may go back into a recession that is why this is catastrophic if we dont deal with the debt limit in a mature way let me cite the numbers in the month of august we expect we are going to have about 172 billion of revenue coming into our treasury but we are going to have 360 billion of bills coming inspending we have already incurred that we have to pay for there are those who say we can pick which bills we want to pay and let the others go they say we will have some winners and losers well i think we will have all losers because we cant pick winners and losers there are some who say well obviously we will pay interest on the national debt ok we will pay that how about social security and how long can we pay social security if we dont pay social security what happens to those on fixed incomes or if we reduce the social security payments how does someone who has planned their monthly budget manage with getting say 40 percent less of their social security in august how do they handle their obligations then what do we do about medicare do we continue to pay medicare at 100 percent well i assume we are going to run out of money what do we do about our military our soldiers who we all say we want to support do we continue their salaries or do we reduce their amounts by say 40 percent if we pay all of those there is no money left over to pay veterans benefits what happens to our veterans who are depending on their checks to be able to meet their obligations then what do we tell our students who are preparing to go to school in the fall about their pell grants that their pell grants arent going to be available and maybe they cant go to school in the fall they have to make plans right now what do we do about small business owners who are depending upon their contracts with the federal government in order to make their payroll is their money going to be coming in on august 3 we cant pay those bills unless we raise the debt limit it has nothing to do with increased obligations of this country we are talking about spending we have already incurred that has already been obligated and now the people who are entitled to the money are asking for their checks what do we do on august 3 i dont believe we have a choice i think we must increase the debt limit i dont think it is an option not to no responsible legislator would consider that to be an option yes lets use that opportunity to manage our deficit i still hold out hope we can get this grand deal it has to be fair it has to be balanced it has to allow america to grow and it has to allow us to create more jobs it has to invest in education and innovation and infrastructure so america can compete we know we can get that done if we use a balanced approach reduce government spending at all levels including the military as we bring our troops home from afghanistan yes we need to look at the money we spend through our tax code we have talked about this over and over we need to have a balanced approach a credible approach to manage our debt that should be our first option but under no circumstances should we allow america to default on its obligations causing harm to every american family i urge my colleagues to put the

able to take care of themselves even though they are under 26 years old bravo for you but thats not the way it is for many young people across the country even if they do have a job you say they dont have insurance because they dont have a job it may be news to you but there are many many many working americans who do not have health insurance but they will under the affordable care act if this amendment were to pass if it were to become law immediately all of those children who can now be on their parents policy if their parents are willing would lose their health insurance with a job or without a job these young people coming out of school are idealistic and ambitious they want to follow their passions and their pursuits that is what our founders told them they could dolife liberty and pursuit of happiness these young people want a healthier life to pursue their happiness to choose a job not based on the health benefits it may or may not provide but to choose an occupation which addresses their aspirationsnot ours theirs so i just want to repeat back to our colleagues something i heard them say over and over again they said we didnt read the bill well we did but clearly you did not and i urge you to read the bill because if you did you would see that the bill puts medical decisions in the hands of patients and doctors not your favorite insurance company you would see that it brings down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors you would see that it ends the days of discrimination based on preexisting conditions and lifetime caps on the care of children and families you would see that under this bill no longer would being a woman be a preexisting medical condition as it is now as women are discriminated against in terms of price and access to insurance you would see that it offers tax credits to millions of small businesses who choose to do right by their employees and offer insurance benefits it was for all of these americans that we acted it is for them that we stand here today to oppose this amendment and if you read the bill you will see contrarycontrary to misrepresentations that were set forth by those who do the bidding of the health insurance industry in our country you would see what the bill does you would see that it is about innovation its about prevention its about a healthier america not just health care in america its about using the technologies of the future its about bringing health care closer to people where they live to lower the cost to improve the quality and to expand the access you would see that it is a bill about the future instead of the misrepresentations about this that and the other thing which i dont even want to repeat here you would see that this is transformative for our country because it gives people the liberty again to pursue their lives so i would like to know how many of you read the bill we read it over and over again to each other drilling down on different parts of it so we know of what we speak when we come to this floor and maybe if you knew more about it you wouldnt be so quick to saywe do not want to allow children to stay on their parents policies we do not want to end discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions for our children we do not want to begin to close the doughnut hole we do not want to have preventive medicines without cost and copay for our seniors and the list goes on and on so thats whats happening here today this is again yet again another example of our friends standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the american people standing up for the insurance companies at the expense of the health and wellbeing of our country it is again an example of washington d c holding on to the special interest status quo it is again this congress saying to the american people we are here for the special interest we are not here for the peoples interest to stacie we are not here for your two daughters for vernal we are not here for women and having being a woman being a preexisting condition to claudette and richard to say to them too bad about your mortgage if you cant pay your mortgage because you have to pay your

you cannot use it there hasnt been a program developed approved or implemented yet so why are we trying to say you cant use any of these funds to go and do that its because the process is from the

thousands of others living along the missouri river experienced a flood of historic proportions and catastrophic damages levees were overtopped or breached fields were damaged and hundreds of farmers homeowners and businesses had to evacuate over 400 000 acres of farmland were flooded along the river including approximately 207 000 in missouri total repair costs from the flood are estimated to reach 2 billion the flood control and coastal emergencies account provides funding to assist in the immediate floodfighting efforts and the repairs historically congress has provided limited funding annually for this account mainly relying on supplemental appropriations as emergencies arise funding for this account the last 2 years has been lower than the 5year average appropriation of 55 million as was the case last year after an emergency the corps must wait on supplemental appropriations from congress or they must transfer funds from existing appropriations for temporary emergency efforts the corps did this internal transfer last year during and after the 2011 flood however it takes time to transfer those funds and temporarily deprives other worthy projects of funding this is especially burdensome given the corps long construction backlog of over 62 billion worth of projects this amendment is a straight transfer of funds to increase funding for the corps flood control and coastal emergencies account and in turn reduce funding for the corps expenses account this transfer would increase the funding to equal the amount that the senate appropriations committee allocated bringing total funding for that account to 30 million for fiscal year 2013 ensuring adequate annual funding for emergencies will better prepare the corps to respond and save time and effort in trying
