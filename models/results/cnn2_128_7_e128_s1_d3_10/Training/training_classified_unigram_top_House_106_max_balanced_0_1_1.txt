they tell us that patients are shuttled out of a hospital before recovery is complete americans know better they want better treatment americans are demanding that the republican leadership take real

send women who receive mastectomies home early against the advice of their physician lastly under the republicans bill if patients are denied care they would not have the right to a meaningful external appeal in other words they will not be able to sue in the final analysis the republican bill will do little to prevent medical decisions from being made by insurance company clerks instead of by doctors and their patients what our health care system needs is the democratic patients bill of rights this legislation will make sure that doctors and patients are free to make decisions about patient health the patients bill of rights will ensure that patients have the right to openly discuss with doctors their treatment options have the right to receive uniform information about their

eastern and western pennsylvania but the east and the west united in this bipartisan effort to find a solution that helps americas seniors with prescription drug bills i thought it was very instructive to hear the comments of the lady from pennsylvania in the letter to our friend the gentleman from pennsylvania and i thought it was equally instructive to hear our friends on the left precede us this evening on the floor focusing on process and politics instead of on problem solving because make no mistake we are committed to forging a bipartisan plan indeed sponsors of both political parties have stepped forward and said even though this is an even numbered year on the calendar even though it is the nature in this institution to realize that about 5 months remain before an election some issues are too important even in an election year to simply preen and posture and yes politic not only was that letter from the lady in pennsylvania very poignant it was also very practical i think another difference that we see in terms of approach is a question of trust our bipartisan plan trusts americas seniors with an aspect of freedom that has been their birthright my folks are now in their late sixties my grandfather is 96 choice has been a part of their life in a variety of settings why then take away choice when it comes to prescription drug coverage i hold a number of senior coffees in my district to sit down with constituents who are articulate informed and very interested in a multitude of topics when this first appeared on the radar screen of the body politic a lady from my district summed it up very nicely when she said to j d whatever you do please dont increase my medicare premium so that i have the honor of paying ross perots prescription bill now think about that despite all the sophisticated talk that comes out of washington d c my constituent really defined the issue she says number one keep medicare affordable dont needlessly raise my premiums number two dont force me into a plan that washington sometimes seems to gravitate toward which in intent is one size fits all which in reality as my colleague from pennsylvania pointed out is one size fits very few and yet everyone is compelled indeed coerced by law to be involved in the plan that is not what we want to do we want to champion choice and the marketplace and we want to make sure that the nearly twothirds of americas seniors who have existing prescription drug coverage can keep that current coverage if they so desire the letter read by the gentleman from pennsylvania from his constituent reminds me of another reallife story involving one of my constituents from apache junction arizona like the lady from pennsylvania she too faced tough choices for herself and for her husband she told me that the prescription bills had become so cumbersome that she was not able to qualify for a plan with prescription drug coverage that she in her 70s was employed at the drivethrough window of a prominent fast food chain one of their outlets in apache junction and at that time paying a penalty for working because of the earnings limit for seniors but she was doing so out of necessity to deal with the prescription bills that she and her husband were facing so let us state a broad objective and observation that most americans can agree with mr speaker and my colleagues and it is this no senior should be forced to choose between buying food and buying medicine that is fundamentally wrong it is our intent to make sure that those who heretofore have not had coverage the onethird of current seniors without a health insurance plan without a prescription insurance plan should have that type of coverage we want to take action to strengthen medicare by prescribing prescription drug coverage that is available to all seniors but undergirded with the principles of freedom and choice that no one in this country i believe wants to abandon even though it was disturbing to hear earlier tonight the chief administrator for the health care financing administration basically say that seniors could not make up their own minds i find that nothing could be further from the truth in my district as i said earlier at town hall meetings at senior coffees at the grocery store at church at the softball and tball games when grandparents come to watch their grandchildren play and visit with me i find that our nations seniors are among the most engaged the best informed now at the dawn of the new century there is unparalleled health and prosperity for todays seniors and indeed this is a blessing and it is an opportunity yes problems exist as i pointed out the situation for the lady in apache junction and as the gentleman from pennsylvania read the letter from his constituent and the tough decision she has been forced to make without prescription drug coverage but we want to make sure that we embrace and bring to the floor a plan that gives seniors the right to choose an affordable prescription drug benefit that best fits their own health care needs this bulletin just in we are all unique we all have different health challenges different problems different prescription bills different treatments why would we choose a plan that would allow washington bureaucrats to bring their red tape and regulation to americas medicine chests that is not what we want to see we want again to embrace the notion of freedom and opportunity and choice for our honored citizens for our senior citizens for people who take the time as every senior in my district has to intimately understand their own challenges their own health needs their own prescription needs and to deal with it we do not want to force the twothirds of seniors already covered out of coverage if it works for them the real challenge with the onesizefitssome approach is that in an effort to have the heavy hand of government and the washington bureaucrats take the role of the corner druggist that when government inserts itself into that dynamic we have very serious problems and we would hate to see those plans abandoned let us make sure that good coverage is maintained for those who want the private coverage that they currently enjoy let us have a variety of plans based on the free markets that are there and yes in those circumstances in some rural areas in some areas that have been deprived of coverage yes there is a role for government to play not a game of gotcha or bureaucratic intent but by focusing on what works that is what we are about in this bipartisan plan again our mission is clear here defined by my constituent and her very simple and direct statement please do not increase my medicare premiums so that i have the honor of paying ross perots drug bill make sure the plan focuses first on those seniors and disabled americans who have fallen h4668 cc through the cracks who do not have the prescription coverage who find themselves working a couple of jobs in their senior years to make ends meet who find themselves currently making a difficult choice between food and medicine it is those seniors to whom we should turn first but also in the spirit of competition and choice and option we should allow folks to take a look at their plan to determine which is best for them and find the plan that is right rather than onesizefitssome we should not force seniors into a washington bureaucratrun onesizefitsall prescription drug plan that has too many rules regulations restrictions and allows politicians and washington bureaucrats to make medical decisions indeed this is something that i believe every member of this house ought to be able to agree on as we debate the many facets of health care the many different challenges we face the last thing on earth we should do under the guise of helping the american people is to decide on a course of treatment or action that violates the sanctity of the doctorpatient relationship that prompts bureaucrats whether washington bureaucrats or insurance company bureaucrats to try and make health care decisions the principles we embrace the plan that we will bring to the floor in short order will make sure that there is choice will make sure that the twothirds of seniors with current coverage can continue to enjoy that coverage if that is their want but also provide other plansand other availabilities and that is what we need to do again i would call on my colleagues to make sure that even in this evennumbered year that even with that great exercise unique in our constitutional republic where we as constitutional officers stand at the bar of public opinion the first tuesday following the first monday in november even with the temptation of some to turn this into a bumper sticker issue to come to the floor and impugn the motives of others we understand that oftentimes free discussion in our constitutional republic and in this chamber can bring out both the best and sadly the worst in people so tonight our call is to every member of this institution and to every american to put aside the partisanship to embrace the principles of freedom and choice and to focus on what works making sure that seniors have choice in prescription drug plans that the onethird of seniors currently not covered by a plan have options available to them options that will also exist for those currently covered by insurance but that we do not throw away or get rid of that coverage as a washingtonrun compulsory coercive plan would do so i would challenge my friends on the left to put aside the venom the vitriol and the predictable political speeches in search of a bumper sticker golution and join with us in a plan that is already bipartisan that already has the support of republicans and democrats from across the country folks who have listened to their constituents and heard loud and clear put aside partisanship focus on what works that is our challenge i believe we will meet that i would simply say to my friends in arizona to keep those cards and letters coming we appreciate their insight we understand that they are on the front lines in this battle and their

coming from inside this chamber encouraging america to retreat from its role as the worlds only remaining superpower it is time for us to take a step back and reshape our thinking about how we can apply sanctions that are more in tune with what actually happens in the world wellintentioned sanctions are becoming less and less effective if we do it on an unilateral basis currently it is estimated that half the worlds population is subject to some sort of sanction on the part of the united states yet it is estimated that only onefifth of the programs that we have applied previously in the last 20 years achieved their intended goals the institute for economic analysis estimated that unilateral sanctions have a very real cost for americans and our businesses perhaps as much as 20 billion per year in lost opportunities which translates into a potential job loss of 200 000 american jobs and those that are in the international arena turn out to be amongst the highest paying american jobs we see persuasive evidence that unilateral sanctions simply do not work the threat of sanctions not only failed to deter what happened in india or pakistan regarding nuclear testing but it would have cost people in the region that i represent in the pacific northwest a huge wheat sale if congress had not acted quickly to grant a waiver authority to the president so he would not have to apply the sanction well it rescued a potential loss of business but it made us look foolish having this sanction out here and then not applying it when the chips were down the example of cuba is perhaps one of the most abject failure where we have imposed sanctions basically alone in the world yet castro continues to thrive after 40 years and in fact perhaps has been even more entrenched by our opposition to his regime the simple fact is if we are going to initiate sanctions we need to have better information to make betterinformed decisions we need to look in a comprehensive way about what we are trying to achieve when will we decide whether or not the sanction is effective and how will we determine whether or not we have met that objective i personally am embarrassed in conversations that i have had with people parliamentarians from other more developed countries who have very thoughtful approaches that allow them to determine when they are going to be involved how they are going to be successful and when they conclude that effort i was pleased to join former representative lee hamilton and senator lugair both of indiana last session when they introduced

electronic commerce for our country and our countrys economy but i want to speak more importantly about the impact of this esign bill on consumers i think we all agree that consumers are the backbone

time it continues to provide the protections that consumers have been accustomed to in the world of paper and written checks and contracts and in the analog world itself h r 1714 which i was very pleased to join the gentleman from virginia chairman bliley in sponsoring in its onset recognizes that there are important state and federal laws that protect consumers today such as the requirement that consumers be provided copies of important documents such as warrants notices and disclosures this bill recognizes and retains these important consumer protection laws and develops a system whereby consumers can choose to accept electronic versions of the documents and then receive them electronically understand consumers choose to do so it furthermore provides that consumers must separately and affirmatively opt in and consent to receiving important documents electronically and then must be assured that those documents can be retained for future use that is why this bill has

thank the gentleman for yielding time to me one of the things i think we have an opportunity to recognize is that sanctions may indeed be for worthy goals or we intend them for worthy goals but the impact of sanctions has not been proven to be effective certainly the sanctions on food and drugs not only are ineffective but in terms of the humanitarian point of view it certainly is inappropriate additionally sanctions on food are counterproductive to our commercial interests particularly when we consider in many of these countries we are now giving food where we are not even allowed to sell food so it is not consistent with our understanding that we should be humanitarian and yet at the same time we will not allow our commerce to sell these very basic goods of food and medicine in those areas in my state the products that we produce in abundance indeed are dependent upon trade having these sanctions certainly poses an economic threat and indeed impacts them economically but more importantly sanctions as a whole are ineffective this particular bill does recognize that having sanctions on food products is inappropriate and not in our best interests the sales of sanctioned products to these most egregious countries when we think of them really are not representing a large portion of our sales it is the principle that this particular bill indeed addresses it removes those sanctions for basic food when we begin to understand it agriculture as a whole represents a significant part of our economy so when we have sanctions on food used as a tool we are indeed putting a deterrent on a significant amount of our economy in my particular state we produce far more pork than anyone else over 75 percent of that must be dependent on trade in some form then when countries are no longer able to buy those particular products or any other products that we have to sell in abundance such as turkeys cucumbers chicken any of those that we are very proficient in producing far beyond our domestic needs it has a great impact i support this in principle and i also support it in its specifics of looking at food as an area that should be barred from sanctions the tools of food and medicine are not only inappropriate for us as a country as a moral cquntry but it is inappropriate for us in commercial way and is counterproductive particularly when we are going to give the food away anyway why not have the opportunity to sell these very basic goods again i urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation i want to commend the gentleman from illinois for his leadership
