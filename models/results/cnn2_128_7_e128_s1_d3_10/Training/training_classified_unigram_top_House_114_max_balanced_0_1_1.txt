have the right to exist should not exist and does not follow our democratic process let me explain why we are doing this there is no greater example of the conflict of visions than this obamacare created something called ipab the independent payment advisory board it is a board of 15 people who are not elected or appointed they have the power to cut medicares payments for treatment they have a quota which they have to hit in order to find the same number to actually cut every year a formula kicks in and the 15 unelected bureaucrats find where they are going to cut medicare payments to providers to hit that quota they can do all of this without congress approval the idea of course is that unelected bureaucrats know best unelected bureaucrats know better than patients their doctors or their representatives in congress they will know which treatment works the best because they are detached they are distant they are above the fray they are not involved in the emotions or the personal relationships that such personal decisions like your health care ultimately involve that is the big problem they are totally unaccountable they are divorced from reality health care is not a statistic it is not a formula it is not uniform it is not cookie cutter it is personal it is individual it is distinct every patient is different this is why patients along with their doctors need to be put in charge of their health care what ipab would essentially do is ration health care it would take control away from patients now the other side says hey no not so fast congress can override thembut that is only with a supermajority vote we have seen this movie before it never ends well seniors will suffer the consequences medicare is more than a program medicare is a promise seniors have worked hard they have paid their taxes they have planned on medicare throughout all their working lives and now that they are retired it is something that they deserve a secure retirement it needs to be there just like it has been for our parents think about what a member of congress will do this board of unelected bureaucrats will say we are cutting medicare x y and z ways to these providers for medicare which will deny services to seniors and they will do it according to this formula that is in law if congress doesnt like it then the law says congress has to go cut medicare somewhere else and overturn this ruling with a threefifths supermajority vote in the house and the senateas if that would ever happen all this thing has done it is designed to basically go around congress go around
