to lay off 1 2 million people because we didnt give them enough to prevent that but we did reverse the results of the bush policy of 8 years which was 775 000 jobs a month being lost dont forget in 2000 in the presidential election the great debate was what should we do about the 5 6 trillion surplus over the next 10 years bush got elected they enacted the bush tax cuts which they said would stimulate the economy and pay for themselves what happened we had the slowest economic recovery of any economic recovery after any recession in the history of the united states the only 8year period

for over 10 percent of the more than 5 7 trillion cigarettes sold globally each year here in the united states approximately 4 billion cigarettes sold each year are illicit cigarette smuggling is typically carried out by sophisticated largescale criminal organizations that take advantage of the significant disparity between the taxes levied on cigarettes across the states for example a pack of cigarettes that costs 13 in a hightax state like new york will cost only about 5 in a lowtax state such as virginia these differences create a highly lucrative market for individuals to evade the local sales tax and purchase cigarettes in one locality and transport them to another for resale below the market value criminal organizations are able to make a profit of as much as 1 million on just a single truckload of illicit cigarettes state cigarette taxes in the united states have been on the rise since 1992 and have increased more than 65 percent over this period however the states gross tax revenues have increased by only 35 percent due in significant part to the illicit tobacco trade exploiting the price disparity for a single pack of cigarettes between individual states has proved profitable for criminal networks according to the justice department this illicit activity costs the states and the federal government approximately 5 billion each year this is money that couldand

that the financial crisis was avoidable and was the result of the following factors an explosion in risky subprime lending an unsustainable rise in housing prices widespread reports of egregious and predatory lending practices dramatic increases in household mortgage debt and exponential growth in financial firms trading activities unregulated derivatives and shortterm repo lending markets just among a few of the red flags surely with all those factors chairman bernanke should have been more concerned in fact the title of my speech this morning is even with warning signs bernanke failed to sound the alarm in fact he was warned by members of the federal reserve board often the release of transcripts from the federal open market committee fomc meetings in 2006 shed light on the critical failures of the federal reserve and mr bernanke to act when the warning signs were clear and present the first meeting however was spent praising bernankes predecessor outgoing federal chairman alan greenspan but the fcic later concluded that 30 years of deregulation and reliance on selfregulation by financial institutions that was championed by mr greenspan were the factors in devastating the stability of our nations market stripping away safeguards that simply could have avoided this catastrophe now in a later meeting on may 10 2006 of the fomc then fed governor susan bies was one of the earliest to raise concern over the nations mortgage sector which offered exotic loans that increased household debt over time instead of decreasing it now specifically her concerns stem from the absence of home equity growth and the consumers ability to absorb the uncertainties of the housing market listen to mr bernankes response when she made her declaration so far we are seeing at worst an orderly decline in the housing market but there is still i think a lot to be seen as to whether the housing market will decline slowly or more quickly yet again another colleague then fed vice

of the economy in the last meeting of the fomc fed governor bies again in december 2006 stated once again her concern of the housing market stating that mortgages securitized in the past few years warrants additional risk than the investors have been focusing on despite the concerns that reported increased difficulty getting mortgages in their region as well as a noticeable cool down in housing activity mr bernanke fails to see the warning signs and again predicts a soft landing on december 12 2006 once again this was his second statement of a soft landing in the same year it was the failure of mr bernanke to not pursue possible vulnerabilities and assuring us to the contrary that attributed to the economic crisis that we faced on february 15 2007 he stated overall economic prospects for households remains good the labor market is expected to stay healthy and real incomes should continue to rise the business sector remains in excellent financial condition again on march 28 2007 he stated the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime markets seems likely to be contained even on may 17 2007 despite concerns raised by fed governor bies again he said we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system how wrong he was but all of the dire warning signs were there at

patient protection and affordable care act and he spent the last 35 40 minutes talking about what a great piece of legislation that was and about all of the wonderful things that it has already done well im going to take my leadership time to give the other side of this viewpoint and to suggest that this is not a good bill that this is not helpful certainly my colleagues on the democratic side when they were in the majorityand 2 years ago this coming friday they passed into law the affordable care act obamacarethey felt like this was the best thing since sliced bread like this was the solution to all of our problems yet we spent 2 years cramming that billliterally cramming that piece of legislation all 2 811 pages of it down the throats of the american people when our unemployment rate was 9 5 percent when 15 million americans were out of work and another 15 million were underemployed this was our number one priority national health insurance a complete government takeover of onesixth of our economy this is what the democratic majority in the 109th 110th congresses have forced upon the american people the gentleman from new jersey can talk about all the wonderful things that have occurred since the passage of obamacare but let me just point out some truths that dont need any adjectives to explain the truth is there were never 47 million people in this country who could not afford health insurance there may have been 47 million who didnt have health insurance but how many million people of that 47 million estimate were making more than 50 000 a year how many were making more than 75 000 a year and how many of the 47 million uninsured were in this country illegally how many were eligible for one of our safetynet programs like medicaid or the schip program for their children in their respective states and when you crunch all of those numbers there may have been and may be 15 million people in this country who do not have health insurance because they cant afford it or because they dont want it they would rather pay as they go now im not going to stand here and suggestparticularly as a physician memberthat thats a wise thing to do the expression is to go bare in regard to health insurance coverage i wouldnt recommend that but certainly as an individual in this country the land of the free we have the constitutional right to make that decision for ourselves and our families and what the democratic majority did with obamacare the way they made it work when you cut right to the chase so they could cover people with preexisting conditions whether they were nearly seniors or children to eliminate yearly or lifetime caps to provide preventive health services that didnt previously exist the way they did that colleaguesand you know thisthey cut 550 billion out of the medicare program they virtually gutted medicare advantage twenty percent of seniors select medicare advantage the title speaks for itself its an advantage because that program covers many of these preventive services that the gentleman from new jersey was talking about that are now available under obamacare they were available under medicare advantage but now that program has been gutted its been cut 14 percent per year over a 10year period of time so you rob from peter to pay paul and who is paul paul is this 15 million to 20 million that are left in that group who have no insurance many of whom who dont want it and now we have created a whole new entitlement program that we cannot afford when 15 million people are out of work and the unemployment rate forwhat is it38 straight months now has been above 8 percent that despite the fact that the stimulus bill and its 875 billion on shovelready projects that promisedthat promised when the unemployment rate was 7 6 percent that this would solve the problem and it would not go above 8 percent it hasnt been below 8 percent since weve spent the money so i say to the gentleman from new jersey and my democratic colleagues in this chamber you fiddled for 2 years you fiddled while rome was burning and so yes now you can beat the drum and celebrate the 2year anniversary of obamacare while 60 percent of this country continues to tell you they hate it they hate it and theyre going to tell you that loud and clear as they did 2 years ago theyre going to tell you that loud and clear november 6 2012 i take no pleasure in that i enjoy being in the majority mr speaker enjoys being in the majority but our responsibility is to the american people especially to our seniorsour moms and dadsand those folks who are struggling who are on a fixed income but to suggest that were helping them when we cut their program 550 billion to suggest that closing the doughnut hole is a good thing and lowers the cost of health care and lowers the cost of prescription drugs no it doesnt because what this federal government what uncle is doing is forcing the pharmaceutical industry to pay for that doughnut hole and to pay for it with brand drugs when prior to obamacare we were filling that doughnut hole with generics and so what is going to happen this pharmaceutical industry its whackamole you squeeze that balloon its going to bulge out on another side and its going to bulge out when they raise the premiums for prescription drug coverage for everybody else the gentleman talked about these wonderful exchanges that are going to be set up for the people who dont have health insurance i dont object to the idea of setting up state exchanges thats an idea thats been around for a long time it didnt just originate with obamacare but when you hear my good friend from new jersey the ranking member of the health subcommittee on energy and commerceand he certainly should know of what he saysthat in these exchanges people are going to get a subsidy in other words thats a government handout theyre going to get a check if they make 75 000 to 80 000 a year you heard him say it colleagues you heard him say it now i would like to ask the 700 000 people in the 11th congressional district of georgia what they think of 70 000 75 000 80 000 a year and getting a government handout a subsidy my people the people i represent would feel wealthy if they made 75 000 a year and they would not be expecting a government handout what this administration has done with this piece of legislationmr pallone criticized the republican idea in the republican budget of blockgranting the medicaid program the medicaid program colleagues its been around since 1965 its a good program its shared between the federal government and the states but under obamacare states are told that they cannot be innovative in regard to designing a medicaid program that best fits the needs of the citizens of their state its called maintenance of effort obamacare says to the governors of the respective states you cant do anything you cant make any changes whatsoever in your medicaid program you cant check on eligibility you cant check to make sure that an individual that applies is in this country legally you cant drugtest these individuals you cant do anything to make sure that that program for your state is going to those who need it who are eligible for it and to who deserve it because of this maintenance of effort restriction under obamacare not only do we put handcuffs on the chief executives of our states but we also mandate that they now cover under the medicaid program people up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level prior law the requirement was 100 percent yes some states went above that when times were good when unemployment was 6 percent instead of 9 5 percent as it is in my current great state of georgia but states cant afford to do that but the federal government comes along and says because of obamacare were going to force you to stay where you are you can make no changes you cannot go down to 115 percent or 100 percent oh no you have to stay at 133 percent and we are looking at an additional cost to the states over the next 10 years of 15 billion thats why this is part of the lawsuit that the supreme court will hear next week in the 6 hours of testimonythat and this individual mandate in obamacare that forces individuals to engage in commerce the federal government regulating commerce as provided for in article 1 section 8 clause 3 of our great constitution oh no this says whether you are engaging in commerce or not you have to participate i know my colleagues have heard the expression and the comments from me and others whats next everybody has to eat broccoli its absolutely absurd its patently absurd for the federal government to tell people they have to engage in commerce we understand the constitution and the right constitutionally to regulate existing commerce between states but not to force people so as i have these moments tonight to talk about as a counterpoint to mr pallone in regard to the patient protection and affordable care act it could not be more unaffordable the cbo just came out with a new score originally 2 years ago that score was something like 950 billion and according to smokeandmirror accounting completely paid for now the costthe adjusted costis about twice that its about twice that so its not the affordable care act but the patently unaffordable care act for my colleague to criticize the republican majority for coming forward with a budget that includes a plan to save medicare and medicaid legacy programs programs that our seniors and our poor are so dependent on for us to have a plan to save that and for the gentleman from the other side of the aisle to criticize that i would ask him if he were still in the chamber and i ask all of my colleagues on the democratic side of the aisle what is your plan what is your plan to save the medicaid program what is your plan to save the medicare program how many different studies do we need from how many different commissions over how many years before we accept the plain hard cold truth that the hospital trust fund and medicare program will be insolvent at the very latest by the year 2024 and by the earliest at the year 2016 as estimated by the medicare actuaries nobody denies that but what are my democratic friends doing about it theyre doing two things theyre whistling past the graveyard and theyre enacting ipab the independent payment advisory board colleagues youve heard it all evening as weve discussed the repeal of ipab and h r 5 the health act ipab is 15 unelected bureaucratsunelected but appointed by the president this presidentat a salary of 176 000 a year for a 6year term renewable for another 6 so were stuck with them for 12 years and that fat salary and benefit package so they can say were going to save medicare by cutting reimbursement to health care providers and prescription drug companies we cant change the age of medicare eligibility we cant increase the annual deductible or copay no we cant do anything any of those things we can only cut provider reimbursement oh but theres no rationing it says there in that section regarding ipab that no rationing will occur well give me a break if you cut reimbursement to providers and they stop providing the care then the senior does not get that knee replacement and does not get that stent put in you can spell it any way you want to but thats rationing thats rationing and the american people dont want that our seniors dont want that thats no compassion you can provide all these preventive services you want to that mr pallone was speaking about and thats fine if you can afford to do it but to suggest that that saves money it might save an individual life and thats a wonderful thing but dont stand up here and tell me and tell my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that preventive services save money no economist no health economist would agree with that it doesnt save money it costs money and every time you add another free preventive service to a program its going to increase the health insurance premiums for everybody else these are called mandates the gentleman from new jersey talked about direct access without prior approval whether its to see your obgyn doctor your dermatologist or your general surgeon without having to go through a gatekeeper i understand that i practiced medicine 31 years i think my colleagues know that i understand that but these things definitely cost money they dont save money i think its important for people to understand that he talked about the wonderful things that have already occurred under obamacare allowing adult childreni realize thats a bit of an oxymoron but ive got four of those oxymoronsto allow adult children to stay on their parents health insurance policy until theyre 26 years old without regard to whether or not theyre students now the prior policy of most health insurance companies if you were over 21 years old maybe in the third or fourth year of college then you were no longer eligible to be covered under your parents health insurance policy the expectation of course is that you would have a job well the reason its so important now to have them covered up to age 26 on their parents health insurance policy is because they have no jobs and thats the thing that this administration and thisnow at least in the house of representativesdemocratic minority they just dont seem to understand that what the american people care about first and foremost is a job they want health insurance of course they do if they have to theyll pay for it out of their own pocket but theyve got to have a job first theyve got to put food on the table theyve got to put clothing on the backs of their children they have to have the pride dignity and respect of having a job as we go into these elections this fall and all 435 of us in this body and 100well in fact i guess its onethird of the other body stand for reelection and we elect a 45thand indeed i think we will elect a 45th and not reelect the 44thpresident of the united states its going to be based on jobs and the economy thats the thing that this president since he took office in january of 2009 has just totally missed the point of and really it started in january of 2007 with the democratic majority in this chamber when we spent another 2 years wasting time fiddling while rome was burning trying to force and cram down the throats of the american people this capandtrade regime which would have cost every family 2 500 a year in increased utility costs thank goodness the other body stopped that because the american people didnt want it and they dont want national health care thats why we voted in this body h r 2 to repeal obamacare and that repeal passed in the house of representatives we finally had a vote in the senate we couldnt get them to pass a budget they havent done that in 3 years but after about a year and a half we finally got them to vote on repeal of obamacare the democratic majority rejected that so now were dealing with plan b and plan b is to chip away at the most egregious aspects of obamacare it would be a mistake for us to assume the supreme court will strike down that individual mandate and will strike down that medicaid expansion that unfunded mandate a 12 billion burden placed on the budgets of our respective states i think they will strike it down but im not going to stand here in this chamber holding my breath waiting for that to happen that would be irresponsible that would not be representing the people of the 11th of georgia the way they deserve to be represented so we are going to fight thats what this is all about today and the vote tomorrow in regard to repealing ipab this independent payment advisory board that literally takes legislative responsibility away from the congress talk about unconstitutional clearly that is unconstitutional were going to vote it down tomorrow and were going to send that to the senate and i expect harry reid and the democratic majority to do the responsible thing they dont like it either they dont like it either lets dont make an election issue out of it lets just do the right thing for the american people its been a long day we have had a lot of discussion on the floor of the house of representatives a lot of eloquence on both sides of the aisle i feel very strongly

year 2012 appropriations bill for the department of homeland security this bill before us today perhaps more than any other bill exemplifies the difficult choices that need to be made in order to address our nations fiscal crisis this bill demonstrates how we can fully fund vital security programs while also reducing spending overall furthermore this bill does not represent a false choice between fiscal responsibility and security both are national security priorities and both are vigorously addressed in this bill i am under no illusion that everyone here in this chamber will agree with the spending reductions included in this legislation but now more than ever our government needs fiscal discipline and this bill takes the necessary steps toward that goal the bottom line more money and more government do not equal more security so in this time of skyrocketing debt and persistent threats we must get our homeland security priorities right the bill before us today provides 40 6 billion in discretionary funding or almost 3 billion which is 7 percent below the request and 1 1 billion or almost 3 percent below the fiscal year 2011 level in addition the bill also includes 1 billion in offset emergency supplemental funding for femas disaster relief fund immediately upon enactment there are no earmarks that are set out in this bill or the accompanying report the bill places priority on funding our nations greatest security needsfully funding all frontline personnel such as border patrol cbp officers ice officers coast guard military personnel and secret service agents and fully funding all intelligence watchlisting and threat targeting functions in addition the bill provides funding where the administration and the department of homeland security have failed this bill makes up for the nearly 650 million shortfall handed to us by the department through phony unauthorized fee collections it is irresponsible for the administration to submit a budget based on the illusion that congress is going to raise taxes or fees in this current economy this bill also addresses the wholly inadequate request for disaster relief funding and provides the resources to help our communities recover from natural disasters like the unprecedented flooding across the mississippi river valley the tornadoes that devastated my home state of alabama a few weeks ago and the horrific tornado that destroyed much of joplin missouri just a little over a week ago however programs that have been underperforming and failing to execute their budgets or which have repeatedly ignored congressional directives to measure their results are significantly reduced in short this bill places a priority on the taxpayers limited dollars towards the security programs that will have an immediate impact upon our national security and responsibly reduces spending wherever possible the bill is constructed around three core priorities number one fiscal discipline number two targeted investments in security operations and disaster relief and number three meaningful hardhitting oversight first on fiscal discipline the bill goes further than simply cutting spending this bill insists upon real reformreform in how the department justifies its budget reform on how fema manages its first responder grants and reform on how fema the department and the administration budget for the costs of disaster relief number two on security the bill includes nearly 150 million worth of targeted investments above the budget request for security operationsthe frontline programs that are among the most critical at keeping our nation secure and these activities that directly countered recent terrorist attacks and address known threats on disaster relief i have seen firsthand what natural disasters can do over the past few weeks and i can tell you that my constituents in alabama are expecting fema to get it right so this bill picks up from where we left off in fy 2011 and provides an increase of 850 million above the request and within the budget for femas disaster relief fund to address the known and expected cost of disasters in fy 2012 and as we added unanimously in our full committee markup of the bill last week 1 billion in offset emergency supplemental funding is provided to fema to ensure that disaster relief efforts stay on track this year and well into 2012 and three finally is oversight our subcommittee has a long tradition of insisting upon results for each and every taxpayer dollar that is appropriated this is a testament to the previous leadership on this subcommittee that was exhibited by our founding chairman of this subcommittee chairman rogers and also my predecessor and now the subcommittees ranking member mr price this bill continues the dedication to frontline security programs and robust oversight by including numerous spend plan requirements reporting requirements and operational requirements such as border patrol staffing levels and an increase to ices detention capacity now i know there has been some criticism on the funding level this bill is recommending for femas first responder grants let me emphasize that there is more than 13 billion in the pipeline that has not been spent but fema has yet to establish a credible method for measuring the impact of these grants so this bill takes bold steps to get femas fiscal house in orderrequiring accountability for every dollar spent requiring a plan for drawing down the enormous unexpended balances consolidating duplicative grant programs putting priority on highrisk needs and rewarding programs like the emergency management performance grants that actually spend their funds wisely and are willing to measure their results i know how important first responders are to this nation we see it every day but we simply cannot keep on throwing money into a clogged pipeline when our debt is soaring out of control i believe its our duty to reform these grant programs this bill is about putting a priority on limited dollars and robustly supporting the most essential functions the department of homeland security with all its critical missions is not immune from fiscal discipline that means the department has to find the most costeffective way to meet its mission requirements the american people are demanding no less in closing let me thank ranking member price

appropriations bill the one that weve been talking about that would prevent the department of justice from enforcing regulations regarding access to swimming pools under the ada the americans with disabilities act since passage of the ada in 1990 congress has never acted to weaken the adas promise of increased opportunity and access for our neighbors friends family and colleagues with disabilities today however this house is poised to strip the justice department of its ability to enforce certain accessibility rules we are at this unfortunate and unwarranted juncture because of an aggressive advertising and lobbying campaign that misrepresents what the ada is and what the department of justice rules require congress should not roll back reasonable balanced and negotiated civil rights standards that have long enjoyed bipartisan support based on an alarming misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the ada and department of justice regulations nor should we override a nearly decadelong regulatory process that began under the administration of president george w bush and concluded after extensive public notice and comment by adopting the guidelines that the united states access board developed in 2004 during the george w bush administration certain members of the hotel industry and their lawyers have claimed that department of justice rules require all pool owners to install fixed lifts in every pool that this is costly and burdensome and that owners who cannot afford to install lifts will have to shut down their pools or face civil penalties these claims are simply false as required by congress when it passed the ada in 1990 the justice department has now issued rules to increase access to newly constructed and existing swimming pools rules that have been under development for almost 15 years new pools must be built with either a sloped entry into the pool or a pool lift under these new rules for existing pools owners will have to do what is readily achievable based on the size and resources of the owners business and the prospective cost of the improvement if it is readily achievable which is defined in the ada as easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense a business should take the same steps to improve an existing pool that it would take if it were building a new pool this means that if a fixed lift can be installed easily and inexpensively it should be if installing a fixed lift is too expensive and difficult it is not legally required the law did not impose a onesizefitsall requirement the law is quite flexible fixed lifts are superior to portable lifts because a fixed lift provides a safer and more independent means of getting in and out of a pool for a person with a disability a fixed lift is available whenever a pool is open without the need for staff to locate the lift ensure it is in proper operating condition and provide timely and safe installation while the disabled person waits this allows a person with a disability to swim whenever a pool is open just like everybody else while those pushing this amendment have raised concerns about lift safety the united states access board has found no evidence of increased safety risks from pool lifts the same measures already in place at a hotels pool such as prohibiting unsupervised children from using a pool should prevent misuse of a pool lift as for other pool equipment like diving boards slides deck chairs or tables this unnecessary amendment will harm countless americans and veterans who rely upon the ada and we have heard from a number of organizations and individuals who oppose legislation prohibiting doj from enforcing its regulations i would like to include some of the letters and testimony sent to the house judiciary committees constitution subcommittee where i serve as ranking member in the record opposition to the amendment comes from organizations that work with a broad spectrum of persons with disabilities including the national center for independent living the association of university centers on disabilities the american association of people with disabilities and the national disability rights network to name a few a father and swim coach in georgia wrote that swimming has helped his sona medalist at the athens and beijing paralympicsmake friends earn respect achieve goals and make the best of his disability a dozen veteran organizations wrote similarly of the benefit of rehabilitation and recreational opportunities for wounded and disabled veterans and servicemembers these americans have paid a high price in service to their country they should be able to count on the ada to ensure equality and opportunity here at home before today our commitment to the ada was a shared one it would be unfortunate if that were to change under republican leadership in the house i call upon my colleagues to ensure that this illadvised amendment is not included in any bill sent to the president for his signature these regulations which have not yet been imposed which the justice department has said may be postponed another few months if necessary are in the spirit of the adathey are proper they are well considered and they oughtnt to be set aside by lobbyistdriven amendments with that i yield back the balance of my time dear senator representative we the undersigned veterans organizations are writing in support of the department of justices doj final rule detailing requirements for accessible entry and exit for pools and spas under the americans with disabilities act ada our organizations strongly support the principles of the ada because they ensure independence and reintegration for wounded servicemembers and disabled veterans after a decade of war we must ensure that the ada continues to stand for equal treatment and nondiscrimination in access to rehabilitation employment educational and recreational opportunities specifically congress must not weaken the principles of the ada by delaying or otherwise inhibiting dojs enforcement of the pool and spa accessibility regulatory requirements doj published the final rule on accessibility in september 2010 after engaging in six years of public outreach which included multiple opportunities for all stakeholders to provide comments although the final rule was to go into effect on march 15 2012 doj delayed compliance until may 21 we believe that our nations disabled veterans and wounded warriors have waited long enough for access to pools and spas the january 2012 guidance issued by doj clarifying the intent of the final rule for existing pools and spas did not change the requirements doj published in september 2010 the gold standard for new construction is a fixed pool lift it is logical that fixed pool lifts would be required for existing pools and spas if readily achievable readily achievable means that an existing pool or spa would only need to have a fixed pool lift if it was not costly or burdensome readily achievable is the flexibility that was built into the ada to ensure that a onesizefitsall approach would not be required thus if it is not readily achievable for a small familyowned business to install a fixed lift for a pool or spa then they are not required to under the ada the adas inclusion of the readily achievable standard represents the compromise between the needs of people with disabilities and the costs of accommodations if congress intercedes by delaying implementation or hindering enforcement of dojs final rule we fear that a dangerous precedent will have been set for the future of the ada the final rule was the result of an extensive regulatory process that provided ample opportunity for participation it is now time for congress to step back and

and grandchildren reducing government spending though is never an easy task we face difficult choices but house republicans have lived up to our responsibility to find ways to cut our costs so that we can once again live within our means the house agriculture committee has been asked to do its part by finding 33 billion in savings over 10 years we did that by making credible commonsense reforms to the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap these provisions reduce waste and abuse and close program loopholes snap formerly known as food stamps comprises almost 80 percent of the agriculture committees mandatory spending over the past 10 years the cost of snap has nearly tripled increasing by 270 percent the changes that were proposing today cut only 4 percent over the next 10 years i would like to make it absolutely clear none of these recommendations will prevent families that qualify for assistance under snap from receiving their benefits we are working to better target the program and improve its integrity so that families in need can continue to receive nutritional assistance opponents of this legislation would have you believe that we are decimating the nutritional safety net and that hungry children and seniors will be left to fend for themselves that is a false and misleading scare tactic its important to remember that many of the very people opposing these cuts proposed and voted for similar measures during the last congress when they were in control of this body not once but twice my colleagues on the left voted to cut a temporary increase in snap benefits under the american recovery and reinvestment act one of those cuts was to pay for the bailout of a union and now that house republicans are advocating that same policy those across the aisle are crying foul by ending the artificial increase in snap benefits we can save 5 9 billion over 10 years and we wont be turning that into more government spending it will go towards deficit reduction this legislation also ends bonuses that have been awarded to states on the taxpayer dime states are responsible for administering snap and its their duty to make sure the program is operating in the most efficient and effective fashion we save nearly 500 million by ending bonuses that are given to states for merely doing their job we also find savings by closing loopholes that allow states to game the system when administering snap first well stop states from abusing the low income home energy assistance program liheap to inflate snap benefits states are exploiting the interaction between liheap and snap by sending a token check to households which can trigger hundreds of dollars in increased snap benefits liheap is a valuable program for households in need of assistance with heating and energy costs it shouldnt be abused in this fashion in new york city a 1 liheap check triggers an additional 131 in snap benefits per month for nearly 90 000 households in washington state a 1 liheap check triggers an additional 43 million in snap benefits thats egregious and taxpayers know it these token checks not only undermine the integrity of both snap and liheap but they also cost taxpayers billions of dollars in overpayments closing this loophole saves 14 3 billion over 10 years and ensures that both liheap and snap are targeted to the families who truly need the assistance another loophole weve closed is called categorical eligibility which allows any household that receives a benefit from certain lowincome assistance programs to become automatically eligible for snap some of these benefits can be as simple as providing a household with a pamphlet or access to a 1800 number hotline when states implement categorical eligibility these households do not need to meet snap or gross income tests thats how lottery winners slip through the cracks and continue to receive nutrition assistance when someone is categorically eligible for snap states dont have to verify assets like lottery winnings and it isnt just lottery winners that are unfairly collecting benefits either the cincinnati enquirer reported that one woman collecting 500 per month in

to the organization and asking aarp to meet with the doctors caucuses in the respective bodies in a very bipartisan way to try to save medicare there are things that that organization which i respect indeed ive been a member of that we agree with and there are things that we dont agree on now aarp was opposed to what we had in the republican budget last year the socalled paul ryan budget in regard to how to strengthen protect preserve the medicare program not just for our current seniors and recipients of that program but for our children and grandchildren and greatgrandchildren indeed so we want to ask them to sit down with us and say what they do like we know what they dont like i guess they didnt like the mandate of premium support in our budget last year but chairman ryan this year is working very closely in a bipartisan way with senator wyden the gentleman from oregon in regard to this same idea of premium support but instead of mandating itand of course it was only mandated for those younger than age 55 everyone else was held harmlessnow the idea is to say look lets let everyone choose and decide its their option do they want to stay on medicare as we know it the legacy program or would they prefer to go to the doctor and the hospital of their choice with their own premium support so i just wanted to mention that and im looking forward to having a dialogue with the aarp and the 35 million seniors that they represent back in 2003 my colleagues werent here then but i was and i had an opportunity to vote in favor as a physician member of the medicare part d the prescription drug act and aarp supported that and yet our democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle many of them symbolically came to the well and tore up their membership card of the aarp so were going to work with them i think its very important"], [0.0009579658508300781, 0.5009579658508301, 0, "if i could point out the gentleman from washington is correct on this vote theyre not required to unionize but theyre required to adopt the higher prevailing wage theyre required to adopt all the other higher more expensive standards that a union may require that puts that contractor at an immediate competitive disadvantage with all of the other contractors out there there are no unionizedor very few unionized contractors in houston texasthroughout the whole state and thats the problem while perhaps in new york while perhaps in new jersey while perhaps in washington state plas may actually wind up saving you moneyfor reasons mysterious to me as a free market guy but it may save you money this language does not prohibit the use of a unionized contractor in new york let me repeat in the brief time ive got left none of the funds in this act can be used to discriminate against or give preference to a union shop and the government cannot require a contractor to enter into an agreement so you see the language as written were all on the same page here guys this language does not require unionization it doesnt force a nonunion shop to adopt a prevailing wage for example and it enables everyone to bid without discrimination our concern is with the presidents executive order which says that the president of the united states encourages the local va to hire a contractor that follows union guidelines they dont exist in texas that makes no sense thats why the gentleman from arizona wrote this amendment this way and thats why its important that the house defeat this amendment to save taxpayer dollars and to allow nonunion contractors in righttowork states to compete for these government construction projects i yield back the balance of my time and thank you for the extra time"], [0.0009631514549255371, 0.49903684854507446, 0, "just for the record the
