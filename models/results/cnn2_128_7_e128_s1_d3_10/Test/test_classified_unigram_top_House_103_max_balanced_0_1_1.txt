of these products because the existing co tracting system has failed to accept the technologies and has slowed the developme of a national market for these products in june of this year subsequent to the hee ing referred to in the appropriation comm tees report to h r 2750 the federal highw= administration and the unitedstates environment protection agency issued a joint report congress stating that no evidence exists th crumb rubber modified pavements have han ful emissions and cannot be recycled this r port while indeed recommending addition research shows no scientific reason to sto using

administrative jurisdiction over the ocracoke light station to the secretary of the interior subject to such terms as may be necessary for coast guard purposes the coast guard would retain the right by permit to operate and maintain the lantern but all other property so transferred would be included in and administered as part of the cape hatteras national seashore both the national park service and the unitedstates coast guard have testified in favor of this transfer the committee on natural resources made only one technical change the bill as introduced referred to the cape hatteras national seashore recreational area in three places while an earlier law described the area by that title the correct reference is cape hatteras national seashore and the committee changed the references accordingly i believe the light station is an appropriate site for the national park service to administer the light station is listed on the national register of historic places and the national park service already cooperates in providing interpretation there this is an efficient and appropriate transfer and i urge my colleagues support i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
