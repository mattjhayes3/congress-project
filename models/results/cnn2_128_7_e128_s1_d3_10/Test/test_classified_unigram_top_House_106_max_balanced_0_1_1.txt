is clear that a community that is not livable can also have direct impacts on the physical and psychological health of families as well just this week the south coast air quality management district in southern california released a report documenting the danger to people breathing the toxic air that is concentrated near southern californias congested freeways this danger has increased the risk of cancer people today are increasingly concerned about the soaring rates of asthma among our children which clearly appears related to the toxins we are putting into the air recently there was an article that i found amusing in the washington post about how some people really enjoy the real long commute it helps them center themselves and prepare for a long day i suppose that may be true for some but when the average american spends more than 50 work days a year trapped behind the wheel of a car just getting to and from their occupation and when we have lost 43 more hours in the last 5 years to commuting there are direct implications i would venture that for a much larger number the commute to work is not the highlight of their day the national sleep foundation has reported that the 158 hours added to the yearly work commutes since 1969 have been subtracted from the time many americans sleep carol rodriguez director of the institute of stress medicine in norwalk connecticut observed that people with lengthy commutes often exhibit signs of stress in the workplace marriage and family counselors in the bay area see patients struggling with the increased demands and stress placed upon them from their longer work commutes this struggle is manifesting itself in family problems and even divorce it has been noted that divorce itself is no longer a reliever to the stress of long commutes and separation because often after a family breaks up the difficulties of two households in coordinating the needs of children and employment are usually greater in terms of time and miles driven to hold things together the jobrelated problems where employers increasingly in congested communities never seem to know when their employees are going to show up seems tame by comparison one of the most interesting developments may be found in a report from the center for disease control and prevention on increasing obesity rates in the united states rates have been increasing since 1991 all across america but there was particular concern about an increase of over 101 percent in georgia in 1991 when the study began metropolitan atlanta had one of the lowest obesity rates what is the reason for the increase some blame the traditional southern diet which it is true is often high in fat but the souths diet is not that much different than the rest of the country today in any case it certainly does not explain why georgia has the worst problem than the rest of the south it is interesting that the researcher placed part of the blame on the problems that metropolitan atlanta is facing as the community has become less and less livable the skyrocketing obesity rates coincide exactly with the explosion of unplanned growth around metropolitan atlanta which some claim is the highes growth rate in history dr william deats one of the studys coauthors points out that the time in the car encourages not just more fast food it eats into the time for exercise others have noticed that atlantas unplanned growth has shortchanged the opportunities for outdoor exercise it is not a walkable community sidewalks do not lead anywhere and even if people had the time and a place to exercise the increasingly bad air makes the benefits of exercise problematic it is important for us to reflect on why the political landscape is being influenced by the discussion of livable communities and why it is such a major issue it seems at some level the american public understands that their health both emotional and physical of the family the ability to be fit reduce stress

last year on india and pakistan after the two countries conducted nuclear tests last week in this body legislation was approved that would continue for 1 year the presidents authority to waive the sanctions these are worthy initiatives that i hope we can build on but the senate legislation also includes language that would repeal the pressler amendment prohibition on unitedstates military assistance to pakistan in 1985 congress amended the foreign assistance act to prohibit all unitedstates aid to pakistan if the president failed to certify that pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device known as the pressler amendment after the distinguished former senator who sponsored the provision this law arose from the concern that pakistan was ignoring unitedstates concerns about proliferation despite promises of billions of dollars of unitedstates assistance in 1990 president bush invoked the pressler amendment to block aid to pakistan now the senate has acted to repeal the pressler amendment i believe this is a serious mistake as nothing has changed to justify the repeal of the pressler amendment indeed in recent weeks we have seen strong indications of pakistani support for militants who have infiltrated into indias side of the line of control in kashmir besides the socalled political and moral support for the militants that pakistan acknowledges there is growing evidence that pakistan is providing material and logistic support for the militants and that pakistani army regulars are actually taking part in breaching the internationally recognized line of control in kashmir this is really in a cynical bid to ratchet up the tensions between india and pakistan and at such a time it does not seem prudent in my opinion to renew military transfers to pakistan given the long and welldocumented history of pakistani support for and collaboration with the militants who have been perpetrating a reign of terror in kashmir there is every reason to believe that providing unitedstates arms to pakistan would result in these american weapons being funneled to the militants by arming pakistan we wotild be arming the militants responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians in kashmir and who are now contributing to the escalating tensions with india there was an article in saturdays new york times entitled kashmir militants seek islamic state and it describes how islamic militants from several different nations are working to transform kashmir from a tolerant secular democratic state that people from many faiths call home into an area under strict islamic religious rule i wanted to quote from this article by times reporter steven kinzer he says the campaign is in part a legacy of the proxy war the unitedstates waged against soviet forces in afghanistan during the 1980s the article describes how having succeeded in driving the soviet forces out of afghanistan and establishing a form of religious rule there under the taliban these warriors are now turning their attention to kashmir and quoting again from the times article it says that in srinigar the summer capital of kashmir militants from countries as far apart as indonesia sudan and bahrain have given interviews asserting that they learned the art of war from americans and are now using their skills to fight the indian army many are evidently using not only tactics that americans taught them but also weapons americans gave them in fact the article notes how an indian helicopter was shot down by an islamic guerilla using an american made stinger missile and that about a dozen more stingers each capable of shooting down a plane or a helicopter are unaccounted for in the region the u n envoy in srinigar is quoted as saying that weapons provided for afghanistan with large help from the americans and cia are now in the hands of the militants an indian army colonel states that the militants are using not only small arms that they got from the americans but also stinger missiles and american antitank weapons its not only weapons but also battlehardened troops its a direct result of the american policy in afghanistan mr speaker the soviet defeat in afghanistan was an important tuming point contributing to the collapse of the soviet empire yet one of the unintended consequences has been the creation of a radical movement of armed terrorists mercenaries and militants who have imposed a repressive regime in afghanistan are trying to take over kashmir and who seem to have a great deal of influence within the pakistani government and armed forces i just want to say that during the cold war our fear of soviet expansionism led us to embrace regimes like pakistan that do not share our values of democracy and tolerance but in the postcold war era there is no justification for militarily propping up such a regime maybe we cannot completely st6p the militants who threatened democratic india as well as american and western interests but we can at least make sure we do not give them what they want most and that is american arms sending military assistance to pakistan amounts to a guaranty that these american weapons will

important policy business and competitive issues while some banks are a part of a very large diversified holding company and can take advantage of sophisticated delivery systems others are independent and must fend for themselves regulations are written chiefly to keep the large complex organizations operating within the law but then they are similarly applied to the same small independent bank this situation is made worse for the small community bank when we consider that their primary competitors escape the consequences of heavy regulatory and tax burden this is wrong federal policies should not be implemented to create an unfair competitive advantage that benefits one industry over another where they compete for the same customer base we often overlook the fact that small banks are small businesses themselves they serve as economic engines that drive the local rural economies benefiting millions of consumers small businesses family farms and local merchants having said that however and as a free market proponent i must also add that i am sensitive to the community banks concerns although i am sensitive to those concerns i cannot agree with their position that we should act to isolate them from competition no i say to my colleagues that is not a satisfactory answer to their concerns instead let us work together in passing this rule and h r 10 today and then work to pursue regulatory and tax relief for small community banks it is crucial that we act to preserve the open market competition rather than attempting to burden their potential competitors and rather than attempting to turn back the clock congress should work to help unburden the community banks in this coun try my second point concerns the unitary thrift issue h r 10 is designed to help increase competition and to benefit consumers communities and businesses with those goals in mind how can we justify reining in the unitary thrift holding companies for the record i would like to clarify that the unitary thrift holding company is not a loophole more than 30 years of experience and volumes of legislative history underlay the foundation of its structure congress acted specifically to bring both capital and management expertise into the thrift industry and to promote housing simply put restricting firms from transfering ownership in an attempt to thwart competition disadvantages investors in fact some thrifts were created at the urging of the federal government i am strongly opposed to a legislative taking that might lead to significant costs to the unitedstates treasury i feel strongly that investors should not have value taken from them through some arbitrary action of congress no evidence based on safety and soundness has been presented that would justify prohibiting unitary thrifts from being sold to other companies likewise no evidence suggests that financial companies that buy unitary thrifts should not continue operating their commercial activities today we

municipal water source even though it does not adequately and safely serve the existing and future growth needs of the jicarilla apache tribe in addition the bia has been unable to meet the federal clean water act requirements necessary for discharging wastewater into a public watercourse and has been operating without a federal discharge permit the bureau of indian affairs has seen a growing number of requests to develop operate and maintain water systems on indian reservations throughout the united states unfortunately the bia has chosen other priorities with the result that many tribes needs for safe drinking water have not been addressed in the last several years the jicarilla tribe has spent more than 4 5 million of tribal funds for the repair and replacement of portions of the systems on the reservation the purpose of this legislation is to provide some funding to conduct a feasibility study which will evaluate what steps the bia should take to rehabilitate the system since the bia has failed to fund such an evaluation up to this point the bureau of reclamation through its indian affairs technical assistance office is being asked to conduct this study based on discussions with the various groups involved with the legislation no more than 200 000 would need to be authorized to determine the most feasible method of developing a safe and adequate municipal

myself such time as i may consume i must reluctantly disagree with my good friend from new jersey on her amendment with the gentlewoman from new york tonight this amendment is similar to the lautenberg amendment which was an amendment to a bill in the other body it is vague it is overbroad and it may very well put gun shows out of business if it is passed or adopted the amendment to h r 2122 would amend it to define a gun show as any event at which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited and at which two or more persons exhibiting a firearm are present unlike the underlying bill h r 2122 it does not specify what types of events fall within the definition so a commu nity yard sale where one person is selling his firearm collection which could easily be more than 50 guns and another neighbor who puts one of his firearms on the table to exhibit it without even selling it would consist a gun show under this amendment unlike h r 2122 this amendment only requires that there be two people exhibiting firearms for it to be a gun show thus the amendment turns on a gathering of three friends who bring their collections to show one another where one friend trades one of his firearms with a friend at no cost with no money exchanging hands it turns that into a gun show under the mccarthyroukema amendment before these friends could trade guns with one another they would have to have a licensed dealer runa background check on themselves and transfer them the firearm or firearms for them the mccarthyroukema amendment only allows licensed dealers to conduct background checks at gun shows since gun shows are places where nondealers go to exhibit their collections this requirement will so burden gun shows sales that i doubt that many gun shows would ever be held we are not here today to put gun shows out of business we are here today to stop people who are violent felons criminals from being able to buy guns at gun shows the mccarthy amendment is so overbroad that it would require gun show promoters to keep records on every patron at the gun show who lawfully brings a firearm with them and shows it to some other person even if they are not a vendor with a table or booth at a show why because under this amendment gun show promoters must register anyone who merely exhibits a firearm to another person even if they are not a vendor with a table or a booth at a show or be subject to criminal punishment it is unfair to subject gun show promoters to a risk they simply cannot control the mccarthyroukema amendment is so overbroad that it requires gun show promoters to give notice to each person who attends a gun show of the requirements of her amendment or face criminal punishment the mccarthyroukema will have the effect of ending most gun shows the risk of criminal punishment for failure to comply with all of the new requirements will simply be too great for anybody to take the risk of running a gun show it is wrong to put gun shows in my judgment at an end although the intentions may be perfectly good it is wrong to put them at an end by regulating them to death h r 2122 the underlying bill even as amended strikes in my judgment the right balance between protecting our communities from felons who try to buy firearms at gun shows and protecting the rights of lawabiding citizens to keep and bear arms so i urge all of my colleagues to defeat this amendment i urge them to adopt the bill that we have before us tonight a bill that would close the loophole in gun show sales to felons it is wellwritten wellcrafted there may be a dispute that i had with some of my friends over the length of time to check on the background of somebody who turns up as a hit but it is basically a fundamentally sound way to close this loophole and the mccarthy amendment on the other hand does not just close the loophole it closes the gun show that is not what we are here tonight about we are here to protect kids we are clear to close the

politics i have offered an amendment to the defense bill that is identical to the showsnorwood keep our promise to americas military retirees bill h r 3573 which has 298 cosponsors in this house 298 members of the united states congress have cosponsored this bill because thousands upon thousands of military retirees have mobilized in an effort in saying their healthcare is inadequate saying they served their country faithfully they earned their healthcare that was promised them and saying h r 3573 is the answer now legislative rules and decisions are failing our military retirees it harms our military and continues to break the promise of earned healthcare for those who have committed their lives to the defense of this country it can be called whatever it will bipartisanship nonpartisanship but i call it america doing the right thing our military retirees stood for democracy during world war ii my father was one of them korea vietnam desert storm and bosnia now they suffer under poor healthcare and today they are prisoners of war being held hostage by the political games these men and women deserve not political games but rather nonpartisan courage the large number of cosponsors are a reflection of the tremendous grassroots support for keep our promise act military retirees do not need more test programs or commissions to tell them what they already know the military healthcare system does not work we do not need to establish a road map because military retirees have been down that road for years thousands of military retirees and veterans die every month while congress spins its wheels agonizing over the problem extending test programs and establishing yet another commission for 4 years will not get healthcare to retirees who need it i know many of my colleagues have suffered what we call sticker shock over the projected cost of my bill but we have bent over backwards to make keep our promise act cost effective by adding language that cuts the projected cost by more than half so surely the cost of the bill cannot be the problem some of my colleagues believe we just do not have the funds to pay for the promise bill but just last week our

groups voiced their frustration about the possible closing of the rocky mountain research center for great plains ecosystem research located in rapid city in response to the concerns raised at the land use summit i introduced h r 4226 the funds authorized by this bill would help preserve important research positions and allow the rocky mountain research center to continue studying and addressing a range of wildlife issues on the regions grasslands and woodlands the research station plays an important role in helping manage the black hills national forest and grasslands the station which focuses on managing prairies to sustain livestock and wildlife has been instrumental in decisions affecting wood production and stream flows and in providing forage for livestock and wildlife species additionally and perhaps most importantly in light of the devastating fires that raged in the black hills region this summer the research station provides vital fire ecology research this bill contains two major provisions that address these important forest management and health needs for south dakota first h r 4226 authorizes the secretary of agriculture to sell or exchange certain lands owned by the forest service and to use the funds to acquire land in order to construct two administrative sites for the black hills national forest by allowing the black hills national forest to construct two new administrative facilities the forest service will be able to eliminate two leased offices which have an annual cost of 150 000 thereby consolidating four administrative sites into two additionally by allowing the sale or exchange of these lands the black hills national forest can increase efficiency and communications decrease public confusion over the location of administrative sites and make the black hills more visible and available to the over four million people that visit the area each year furthermore according to the forest service this bill will save the taxpayers an additional 109 000 in annual maintenance costs and 880 000 in deferred maintenance costs h r 4226 also contains a provision to protect private property owners from being forced to sell their land for the project second this bill authorizes 2 1 million to build a new research laboratory for the rocky mountain research center to be colocated with one of the new forest service administrative buildings authorizing the funds to build the new research laboratory is essential because the forest service has indicated it may close the research station if it does not have a new facility currently the stations laboratory needs major repairs is not handicap accessible does not meet osha regulations and is inadequate to support the units mission in fact it is my understanding that the current facility housing the rocky mountain research center in rapid city was among the lowest ranked in a recent review of all usda research facilities by the strategic planning task force
