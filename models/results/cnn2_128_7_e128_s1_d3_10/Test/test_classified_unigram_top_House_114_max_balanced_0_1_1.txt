was 229 years ago that the virginia general assembly ratified the virginia statute for religious freedom this was authored by thomas jefferson the statute serves as the model for the free exercise clause in our first amendment this is what it said no man shall suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief but that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinions in matters of religion religious freedom is a fundamental human right protected by our first amendment it is essential to our free and flourishing society our nation was found in part by individuals seeking refuge from religious persecution from religious discrimination for these pioneers and for all to come after america was meant to be a permanent fortress of liberty and freedom for all who live within its walls at its essence the concept of religious freedom is about much more than religion it is much more than just showing up to worship service 1 day or 1 night a week it is about our fundamental human right to hold our own beliefs and to live out our lives according to these faiths religious freedom quite simply is about freedom itself this is why the very first part of the very first amendment to our constitution is about religious freedom it is our first and most cherished liberty however our ability to be free to live out the convictions of our faith not only in the public square but also in the privacy of our own homes in our churches in our businesses is in jeopardy right here in our nations capital the misleading name rhnda is nothing more than a legalized

requirements under the national flood insurance program for florida homeowners this is a winwin giving them more options for flood insurance coverage and using new competition to drive down prices and expand coverage options for consumers the national flood insurance program is an important tool that empowers and protects homeowners all across america the biggertwaters act of 2012 took an important step in opening up the market and allowing private flood insurance policies to satisfy mandatory coverage requirements under the program however as we have learned sometimes even the best laid plans can have unintended consequences with a lack of clarity as to which private flood insurance policies are allowed in the program the market has not been able to expand and consumers have been left with just one choice to insure their properties from flood risk the national flood insurance program i recently heard from one of my constituents in martin county florida about how the premium for just 1 year of flood insurance coverage through the nfip ended up being five times the price they expected it to be to make matters worse the maximum coverage was only half of what they paid for the home itself yet they were required to purchase the higher priced plan that did not provide the coverage they needed because there were no other options this highlights the urgent need to allow competition in the flood insurance marketplace to meet homeowners needs and drive down costs but to do that we must allow the states to license and regulate flood insurance policies exactly like homeowners insurance car insurance or health insurance yet almost inexplicably floridas private flood insurance market remains restrained because homeowners are not given the choice to look to private market policies for more flood insurance options the bank will not accept other policies because their regulators havent approved them this bill will solve this problem by allowing state insurance commissioners who have long been considered by congress as the most appropriate regulators of insurance to certify private insurance plans to provide equivalent or better protections for flood insurance other than the nfip plan everyone i talk to agrees that floridas insurance commissioner is certainly better equipped to regulate flood insurance in our state than the federal banking

these technologies still represent a small percentage of their respective markets that share is expanding at a rapid pace and influencing other markets today the unitedstates generates 3 times as much wind power and 20 times as much solar power as we did in 2008 this kind of thinking will help states meet the epas requirements laid out in the clean power plan compared with fossil fuel technologies which are typically mechanized and capitalintensive the renewable energy industry is more laborintensive this means that on the average more jobs are created for each unit of electricity generated from renewable sources than from fossil fuels in addition to creating new jobs increasing our use of renewable energy offers more important economic development benefits local governments collect property and income taxes and other payments from renewable energy project owners while owners of the land that wind projects are built on also receive lease payments ranging from 3 000 to 6 000 per

this year as it has been the most important thing this house has done for 54 straight yearssetting the policy for defending the american people the resolution provides for a structured rule and makes in order 61 amendments this is the first of the two rules the house will consider on the ndaa the committee on rules is continuing to work through the over 375 submitted amendments and it will be making more amendments in order at this afternoons meeting as a member of the house committee on armed services which is the jurisdictional committee for this bill i like many others have spent substantial time in working through this years ndaa a lot of work has gone into the bill to get us to this point and i want to recognize the work of chairman mac thornberry of ranking member adam smith and of each of the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members we should also recognize the very capable committee on armed services staff who has devoted so much time to this legislation this process as in years past has been truly bipartisan the bill passed out of the committee by a vote of 602 it is my sincere hope that this bipartisan nature will continue here on the house floor as we consider the most important thing we will do all year providing for the common defense is the most important function of the federal government and it is one we all take very seriously there are many different threats and challenges around the globe and we and the servicemen and women who protect us need to be ready for each of those threats so you will be hearing a lot about readiness over the next couple of days as we consider this bill because just having a soldier or an airman or a sailor is not enoughthey have to be ready to do the job that we assign to them readiness means that they have been trained appropriately that they have the equipment they need and that they have the support they need to carry out their vital role look around the world as we sit here today north korea is threatening us with nuclear weapons they say they have miniaturized the nuclear weapon they have the missile technology not only to shoot it from land but to launch it from submarines china every day is pushing out further and further with these artificial islands in the south china sea claiming virtually the entire south china sea as theirs that they can control and against the claims of other countries in the regiona part of the world where over 5 trillion in trade moves to and fro which is something that has a direct impact on the wellbeing of the american people look at what is happening in europe russia has taken the crimea they are involved in actions in the eastern part of ukraine today they threaten nato alliescountries with which we have an article v obligation to defend if any country attacks themand russia is threatening those countries today then in the middle east as many of us know we have a resurgent iran after the deal that the president struck with iran last year iran now has access to tens of billions of dollars as the major state supporter of terrorism in the world they are using that money to fund terrorist groups like hezbollah and hamas which cause so much havoc and destruction and death we have this terrible situation in syria a continually bad situation in iraq failed states in yemen and libya our militaryour defense forcesare called upon to address all of thoseto protect us to protect the american people that is why getting this bill right is so important that is why taking it seriously is so important whether it is fighting terrorism in iraq or in afghanistan deterring russian aggression in europe or projecting force in the pacific our military has their hands full and this bill is critical to ensuring that they are ready for what is coming to them and to us let us make sure we understand experts far beyond my background have said that the united states has never faced this levelthis complexityof threat to our national security since the end of world war ii this bill is also an important oversight tool for congress as we work to ensure accountability efficiency and effectiveness from our nations military the ndaa authorizes spending at a level of 574 billion for national defense base requirements and an additional 36 billion for overseas contingency operations this matches the total funding level of 610 billion that was requested by president obama these spending levels are needed to make critical investments that will begin to restore our military readiness it seems like every day a new and alarming report comes out about the dire situation our military is in planes cant fly due to deferred repairs troops arent adequately trained there is a lack of naval vessels in critical theaters these stories have begun the sad reality for our military in recent years and we are putting the lives of our servicemembers at risk to be clear none of these are the fault of our servicemembers who continue to rise to the challenge and do more with less but we as a congress have to fix this problem the ndaa will put us back on track by strengthening our commitment to our military men and women it fully funds the 2 1 percent pay raise for our troops and restores funding for training and maintenance programs while also helping rebuild crumbling facilities the bill is also reform oriented you are going to hear a lot about reform over these next 2 days it includes longneeded reforms to the acquisition process and the uniform code of military justice as well as boosting healthcare programs to ensure high quality and access to care all told there are five components of reform in this bill i also want to briefly touch on a few issues up front that i know my colleagues will likely bring up first this rule selfexecutes an amendment by chairman sessions of the rules committee that would strike a provision of the bill relating to women and selective service this is an issue that the armed services committee has not debated no hearings have been held it was added to the ndaa by an amendment in the dead of night this rule removes that provision and allows congress to properly study the issue wherever you stand on the issue of including women in the draft the american people should have the benefit of a full hearing a full consideration of that issue jamming this thing into this bill and considering it without going through that is not right for the american people whichever side they stand on making that the way this bill stands today is the right thing to do before we make a substantial change i also know the president has some concerns about the way this years ndaa funds our military the bill funds the overseas contingency operation until april 2017 when a new president will have time to assess the security situation and then they could submit a supplemental budget request based on their priorities this is common for the first year of a new administration indeed in 2008 thensenator barack obama thensenator john kerry and thensenator joe biden all supported a similar strategy so i find it very odd that they now oppose that same strategy the bottom line is that this bill adequately funds our military while meeting critical needs for military readiness and supporting overseas operations lets not let politics get in the way here there is enough political theater taking place in the presidential election on this issue this critical issue of national security lets come together as democrats and republicans and show the american people that we can work together on behalf of our military and our national defense i urge my colleague to support house resolution 732 and the underlying bill i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.002456486225128174,

direction that this bill takes us at a time when on one hand many of my colleagues have criticized the agencies charged with implementation of important regulatory reforms such as doddfrank charging those agencies with not bringing forth rules in a timely fashion and then at the same time reducing through the budget process the necessary resources to provide those agencies with the tools that they need to move forward on the rulemaking process and now this yet another i think effort to create another cumbersome step in the process of developing rules intended to implement legislation that was passed here by the united states congress law that is on the books the rulemaking process already includes a very logical progression of steps which allows for a comprehensive and allinclusive comment period under the administrative procedure act that allows the kind of substantive input that is specific to the rules being proposed to be provided to be considered to modify proposed rules and then to move forward in an orderly process the other concern that i have is that there is language that is troublesome to me in terms of the way costbenefit analyses would be conducted and considered very oftenand there is no better example than in the financial sectorif we limit ourselves to industryspecific costs and benefits we lose the fact that many of the costs are not borne by

rights act is an important step in enacting protections and ensuring access to justice for many americans who are survivors of sexual assault in may just this last may i found myself meeting with amanda nguyen lara mcleod and marisa ferri and their friends in my office as part of assault awareness month they had asked to meet with me as the senior woman on the judiciary committee and then they told me i was the first actual member of congress whom they had been able to meet with when i did listen to them this is what i heard amanda nguyen told me about her rape that every 6 months she was faced with the choice of reliving her past trauma or having the state of massachusetts destroy essential evidence that would assist in the prosecution of her rapist her medical forensic examination or rape kit when amanda sought information on how to prevent her rape kit from being destroyed police provided conflicting information she was even told at one point that the kit would be stored indefinitely which was not correct she then had to go back and forth between police and state lab techs trying to locate her kit and even when she found it and got the extension on storing it the technicians moved her kit without telling her and she now has to file an extension every 6 months just to preserve the evidence i listened to marisa ferri tell me that she thought her rape would be the most traumatic experience of her life but what she found out was that even more traumatic according to her was the way she was further victimized by the system after being raped when marisa went to the hospital to seek medical treatment and requested a forensic exam she was prevented from doing so until after she spoke with the detective she asked if the interview could wait until the volunteer from the rape crisis center arrived but was told that she had to be interviewed then if she wanted to press charges alone and confused marisa underwent nearly hours of questioning by a detective who tried to discourage her from filing a report and blamed her according to marisa for her own rape marisa is unfortunately not alone in being misinformed about her rights and being interrogated instead of being allowed the opportunity to undergo a rape kit procedure in an expedient manner and to ensure the maximum effectiveness that the evidence has been collected marisa endured 6 weeks of repeated questioning by the detective about her behavior on the night of the rape at times she said she felt like she was the one under investigation initially her case was closed without the rape kit being tested it was only after she filed a formal complaint that the case was reopened more than a year later and the rape kit was tested many survivors would have given up on a system that had failed them as much as the system failed her and would not have pursued reopening their closed case lara mcleod suffered through further victimization after sexual assault she reports that at 19 years of age she was raped by her sisters fiance but she did not want to report the crime instead her family who she told about her sexual assault informed the police and she was told to go to the station for a formal interview after a cursory investigation she reports that the police accused her of lying about the rape and arrested her her sister was charged with obstructing justice for aiding laras alleged deceit the false charge against lara and her sister were eventually expunged but not before damage to reputation and her sisters savings being spent on dismissing the charges and worse yet her sister being denied full custody of her infant son because of the charge against her which ultimately resulted in this son dying while in the custody of laras rapist i mention these terrifying stories because that is what this bill is all about it is also about the power of individuals to change the law after i heard their stories within 2 hours i talked to judiciary committee chairman goodlatte on the house floor and told him about these stories to his credit chairman goodlatte immediately contacted his staff to make sure that we could work together on this bill only 2 short months later the judiciary committee unanimously approved this legislation the house version includes a small improvement on the text passed by the senate and it is my hope that after passage in the house the senate will also approve this version so it can be sent to president obama for his signature i want to thank all the members of the judiciary committee for their action but even more i want to thank the courageous victims of rape who formed the group rise who did rise and who exerted their power to take control of this situation who would not accept being victimized but instead decided to take their trauma and change the law so that other victims will have more power than they had the congratulations go to them i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
