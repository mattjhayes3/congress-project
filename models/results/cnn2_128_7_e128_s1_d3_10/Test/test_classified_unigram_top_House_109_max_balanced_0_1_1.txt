our 30something working group has been an inspiration to congress and invigoration to us all and i join as a mother of 30somethings and in thanking you for what you have done it is appropriate that the 30 omething group is advocating advancing in a new direction because this new direction is absolutely essential for young people in our country our 30somethings are committed to a better future for all americans so is our new direction a newdirection for all americans not just the privileged few we can begin with our six for 06 to make america safer we will begin by passing the 9 11 commission recommendations we have just observed the fifth anniversary of 9 11 here we are 5 years after 9 11 the commission is giving the federal government ds and fs and incompletes for implementation of their recommendations the first day of congress we will pass the 9 11 commission recommendations and make america safer we will make our economy fairer and we will begin by passing the minimum wage we can do it next week the bill is in the hopper to make our economy fair we can pass the minimum wage and certainly not have congress have any increase in its salary until there is an increase and unless there is an increase in the minimum wage we can also remove the incentives for companies to send jobs overseas imagine taxpayers are giving incentives for companies to send job overseas we will end that we will make colleges more affordable it is important to broaden the opportunity for a college education and we will begin by making college tuition tax deductible and cutting in half the interest on student loans we will make health care more affordable and we will begin by allowing the government to negotiate for lower prices for prescription drugs and we will promote stem cell research that is better for a healthy america we will move towards energy independence that our colleagues were talking about here we will begin by repealing the subsidies that have been given to big oil and big energy compa nies and instead use that 18 billion for research in alternative energy resources every day that we are here we will work for a dignified retirement by preserving social security protecting pensions and encouraging savings for americas seniors this we will do within the first 100 hours of a new congress given the opportunity but we could do it now

passed the budget for this fiscal year how could it be a week before the end of the fiscal year and this donothing congress has not even passed the budget in addition we have a crying need in our country for comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform we certainly are not moving in any direction to make that possible the list goes on we havent finished our appropriations bills we shouldnt leave here until we have an increase in the minimum wage but when we return and hopefully with a verdict from the american people we will get about the peoples business the issues that are relevant to the lives of the american people their jobs their health care their economic security the health care for their families the education of their children safe america safe neighborhoods and a secure america with energy independence we will do all of this from the very first day with integrity our first rule that members will vote on will be for integrity to sever the link between special

that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the

affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these people are goingto qualify for assistance i yield

cystic fibrosis foundation those children face a median life expectancy of 36 years an average that fortunately has continued to increase as science and research have developed better treatment and drugs and while a median life expectancy of 36 is unacceptably low that figure is cause for hope for those living with the disease and of course their families they know that in 1955 the year parents of children suffering from this disease formed the cystic fibrosis foundation children born with cf usually did not live to attend preschool as the life expectancy increases those suffering with this disease and their families continue to work for a cure or a lifeextending treatment while a cure for cystic fibrosis remains illusive the symptoms and effects of the disease are fairly simple cf is one of the most common lifethreatening genetic diseases in the united states more than 30 000 people in the united states have cf and over half of them are children in addition over 10 million americans are unknowing symptomfree carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene cystic fibrosis affects the lungs and digestive system e 1500 the defective gene that causes cf triggers the production of abnormally thick mucus in the lungs that leads to restricted breathing recurring lung infections and in many cases digestive problems the infections deteriorate the lungs and their capacity to deliver oxygen to the body a condition that worsens over time and in many cases even leads to death or the need for a lung transplant one of the goals of h con res 357 is to promote the need for early diagnosis and the importance of newborn screening so that treatment of children with cf can begin as soon as possible to improve their health and longevity the five decades that have passed since the founding of the cystic fibrosis foundation have brought not only hope but years to the lives of those suffering from cf the cystic fibrosis foundation continues to be at the forefront of making more with less in the area of drug discovery and development the therapeutics development program tdp created and launched by the cf foundation has pioneered new ways to conduct cuttingedge lifesaving research in a costeffective and efficient manner this program now includes 18 major research institutions across the country in an established clinical trials network the tdp provides innovative companies with funding raised through private donations to the cf foundation to undertake research and development on promising new drug candidates and supports an extensive pipeline of potential new therapies in fact the cf foundation currently has more than 30 drugs and therapies in various stages of clinical trials any one of which could dramatically improve the life of someone suffering from cf i believe that the innovative programs like the therapeutics development program are part of the blueprint for more efficient and costeffective health care and should be supported so as you can see cf foundationsponsored research is adding precious years to the lives of those living with the disease so that they might live long enough to benefit once a cure is found today there is more potential research on new drugs and therapies than funds to finance that lifesaving work this is a problem created by a wealth of scientific riches and one that i hope can be bridged by more publicprivate partnerships which leverage our worldclass biotech and pharmaceutical companies with the capabilities of institutions like the national institutes of health to ensure that the discovery phase of identifying new drugs and compounds to treat cystic fibrosis continues to that end the resolution before us today advocates strong partnerships between government resources like the nih and nonprofits

fact mr hoyer just quoted john f kennedy and i believe that he was right on target in focusing on that brilliant quote of president kennedys where he said that we should not seek the republican answer we should not seek the democratic answer we should seek the right answer i was struck with that and i believe that we should join in strong support of this resolution of support of this title and i am going to urge my colleagues to join in voting in support of this title which uses the rules base of the 109th congress as the basis for which these proposed changes are being offered but i think it is very important for us to note that if we are going to in fact seek the right answer as opposed to the republican answer or the democratic answer we need to do that by vigorously pursuing the deliberative process about which we all speak and i know that during the past several years my very distinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle raised concerns about a lack of deliberation that existed in this house and the fact that more amendments could have been made in order i will acknowledge that we could have made more amendments in order that was clearly an option there but as my friend having served in the majority knows very well there are challenges that need to be addressed when you are in the majority challenges of managing this institution i see him sitting there very comfortably and i am glad that he is comfortable at this point but i know full well that he is going to face many management challenges in the days and weeks and months ahead but during the past couple of years what we have heard is a commitment to minority rights made by those who were formerly in the majority who were in the minority at that time and are now back in the majority and so i would argue that the words of president kennedy can best be implemented if we in fact do increase the level of deliberation and that is why as we look at the proposed changes that we are going to be considering i have to say that when it comes to the actual management i am concerned i am concerned about the prospect of for the first time in the history of this institution taking prospectively five closed rules and placing that in the openingday rules package similarly i am concerned about the prospect of taking this issue of transparency accountability and disclosure about which we on both sides of the aisle regularly talk because we are here to represent all of the american people the notion of now saying again for the first time in the history of this great institution that we are going to create an opportunity whereby we will not have accountability and transparency in our very important deliberations that will take place in the rules committee and so again i would say in response to the brilliant words of president john f kennedy as outlined by our distinguished majority leader mr hoyer that we do seek the right answer and i believethat the best way to seek the right answer is through enhanced deliberation and we have a chance to do that now i will when it comes to this vote urge my colleagues to vote in favor of title i title i as you know simply provides a chance to use the opening rules package of the 109th congress and i think that that is a c6rrect thing for us to do and i hope the democrats and republicans alike and the majority leader has just called for support of title i and i will urge the colleagues on our side of the aisle to join so that again we will be coming together and i think having the right answer on that with that i reserve

remember thatwe are getting indias cooperation on iran we got two iaea votes out of india including a critical vote to get the iran file to new york that is the fact about cooperation we share the gentlemans concern about iran but our point is that india is cooperating on iran and as we continue to engage india and this agreement is about indias growing energy needs as we engage india we move them away from states like iran rejection of the agreement itself frankly could push india theoretically back towards countries like iran also we have mr markeys theme in the bill itself the bill itself says to secure indias full and active participation in united states efforts to dissuade isolate and if necessary sanction and contain iran for its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction including a nuclear weapons capability and the means to deliver weapons of mass destruction if india breaks this agreement then we the united states will break our agreement with india and i think also it is important to remember that india and the administration both say that they are cooperating on iran quietly behind the scenes why because this is the most effective way to do it and we have seen the positive results but diplomacy cannot be certified the purpose of this agreement is to help establish broad cooperation to establish a partnership between india and the united states you do not compel a partner to cooperate so this amendment is both unworkable and contrary to the spirit of the new relationship we are trying to establish with india how important is that relationship well we have had two administrations the clinton administration and the bush administration forge closer ties with india and overcoming what we remember only too well the chilly relations of the cold war and last julys joint statement committed each country to a global partnership which has accelerated our cooperation on many issues including counterterrorism including iran the international relations committee have given this agreement close and extensive review while nuclear energy is controversial in the united states it is not in india like in several other countries nuclear energy is widely viewed as a critical technology for their electricity one central to uplifting hundreds of millions of impoverished indians so india will develop its nuclear energy sector not as easily or as quickly without this deal but it will nonetheless so this deal needs to go forward with its growing economy india is consuming more and more oil it is competing on the world market competing with american consumers for limited hydrocarbon resources this gives americans an interest in helping india expand its nuclear power industry which this legislation does it also encourages india to move away from burning its highly polluting coal which is in our interest by passing this legislation we also take a step toward internationalizing indias nuclear industry which i believe would make it safer the agreement also is likely to increase indias cooperation with us in confronting countries seeking to break their npt commitment by developing nuclear weapons as it already has with iran india must take inore steps including developing a credible plan to separate its civilians and military nuclear facilities under the agreement congress must approve a nuclear cooperation agreement that the administration is negotiating with the indians before the technology is actually transferred and as i said should india break the conditions of the agreement the unitedstates breaks off the agreement itself so either we continue to try to box in india and hope for the best or we make this move we engage india and hope to use our influence to move this increasingly important

brave men and women who are fighting or have fought in iraq and afghanistan we owe you a debt which we can never repay since the united states invaded iraq i have seen this as a highstakes gambit if we were successful in not only defeating the iraqi army but in the more difficult task of establishing a democratic government we would be far down the road to affecting a paradigm shift in the middle east one which would replace potentates dictators and repression with representative governments transparency and opportunities for both men and women if we were to fail the cost would be incalculable it would be a reaffirmation for many in the world that the united states lacked the fortitude to see a mission through toits completion it would embolden terrorists the world over threaten those states in the middle east such as jordan and israel that are friends of the united states 1000 regardless the situation in iraq is what it is there is no question iraq is a petri dish for terrorists now our main nemesis in iraq is called al qaeda in iraq thus our activities in both iraq and afghanistan are now clearly linked to a global war on terror there is no other way to view the situation i am eager to build on the recent successes in iraq i truly hope that we have turned a corner with the death of zarqawi and the forming of the government if voter turnout is any indication theiraqi people are eager for democracy they had a higher voter turnout in iraq than we did in virginia for our gubernatorial race but make no mistake what we are trying to do in iraq has been and will continue to be extraordinarily difficult even with zarqawi gone there are many dangerous people who will stop at nothing to stop us i dont support a public date of certain withdrawal from iraq doing so creates an untenable situation for our forces and our iraqi allies and presents a real gift of predictability to the enemy but there has to be a sense of urgency we are in a war that we have to win but we cannot plod along indefinitely our founding fathers had 13 years between the beginning of the american revolution the ratification of the constitution and the inauguration of george washington we dont have that luxury in iraq our troops are giving their lives in iraq our country is spending hundreds of billions of dollars we cant pull the rug out from the under the iraqis but we cant babysit the situation either we dont have time to waste on activities that are ineffective we dont have money to waste on bad equipment and services some have charged that this congress has been asleep at the wheel and has done no oversight thats not true i have our committee has held four hearings on contracting practices in iraq including a day for whistleblowers at halliburton and i intend to hold more our subcommittees particularly the one chaired by mr shays have held dozens of others what we have found is a lot of mistakes in management and oversight but remember this is the first time we have contracted this extensively in a combat situation everything about doing business everything in a war zone is difficult and costly and it is disingenuous to deny this if we are going to see this mission through successfully th~ere must continue to be vigorous comprehensive constant oversight to ensure we stay on the right path we should do everything we can to hasten the day when

that this legislation was requested by the board of governors of the federal reserve system and it is also strongly supported by the department of state and the department of the treasury as members may be aware the bis is an international organization that functions as a bank for central banks and is owned exclusively by central banks following consultation with the executive branch and congressional leadership the federal reserve formally joined the bis board of directors in 1994 1530 the federal reserve currently holds two seats on the bis board and participates actively in the important work of the bis to promote international financial stability because the bis is indirectly owned by more than one foreign government the immunities granted by the foreign sovereign immunities act are not available to the bis absent legislative action by the congress under the framework provided by the ioia for international organizations i concur with the federal reserve as well as the departments of state and treasury in concluding that providing appropriate immunities to the bis has significant merit at this time the bis plays a critical role in financing large volumes of unitedstates dollar transactions in the united states daily for its central bank customers it has also been integral to international efforts to promote global financial stability in the face of emerging market financial crises such as those that hallmarked much of the last decade without extending immunities to the bis these transactions could be disrupted by mischievous lawsuits this may create disincentives to conduct international transactions in dollars moreover an extension of immunity to the bis in accordance with the provisions of the ioia would provide protection of its assets held in the united states equivalent to the protection currently enjoyed by the european central bank and other international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund and the world bank indeed congress addressed a parallel situation in 2002 when it passed legislation allowing for the president to extend immunities under the ioia to the european central bank as i noted

going to be a real revolution i would expect by 2020 we will see a substantial number of those vehicles on the road it is going to take a lot of hard work but it will be worth it because they will be essentially pollution free and if we produce the hydrogen using nuclear energy or solar energy something other than petroleum we will also be contributing to a cleaner atmosphere and get rid of the
