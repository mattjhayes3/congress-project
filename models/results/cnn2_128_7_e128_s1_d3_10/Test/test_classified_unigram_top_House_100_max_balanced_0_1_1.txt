natural cultural and fish and wildlife resources particularly the flying foxes the park would encompass approximately 8 200 acres including large areas on the islands of tau and tutuila and a small coastal area on ofu when this legislation was introduced in june of this year i was pleased to join as an original cosponsor as i recognized the importance of preserving tropical forests and their unique wildlife i have been fortunate to deal with insular issues affecting samoa since i fiist came to congress my work has taken me to samoa where i have witnessed the beautiful and diverse flora and fauna of the islands and coastal areas i was equally impressed by the tospitable and proud people of the territory of american samoa they have good reason to be proud the tropical islands of samoa are an often overlooked scenic natural resource of the united states american samoa has one of only three tropical rain forests under unitedstates jurisdiction puerto rico has the beautiful el yunque hawaii has the highly vulnerable forest in the hawaii volcanoes national park and american samoa has the third the diminution of tropical forests worldwide is accelerating with numerous adverse impacts on our environment there exists a considerable amount of interest in the congress as well as elsewhere in the government and among private organizations to stem stop or even reverse the decline of world tropical forests it appears to me that we should first do whatever we can to preserve our own tropical forests a very important factor in sustaining the tropical forests of samoa is a small and often misunderstood animal pteropus samoenis or flying fox a symbiotic relationship exists between these little animals and the tropical forests they need each other to survive the flying fox helps to pollinate the trees and the forest provides safe refuge it is anticipated that a national park would help protect the forests and the flying foxes so that both will continue to thrive and contribute to the environment in our exuberance to establish a park and preserve the forest we have been careful to remember first and foremost the people of samoa they know their islands better than anyone the culture of samoa revolves around the land and respect for nature in agreeing to the cession of the samoan islands of tutuila aunuu and the manua group the chiefs requested that the indigenous ownership of lands by samoans be preserved therefore the legislation provides for the secretary of the interior and the governor of american samoa to enter into a 50year lease of the lands and waters in the park with the option to extend the lease on or before its expiration if the lease is not extended the administration of the park would be transferred to the governor the secretary and the governor would negotiate the amount of the lease payments which would be disbursed by the governor to the villages and families located within the park the high court of samoa would determine the amount of the payments to individuals thus the park would be established without federal ownership of the land prior to the establishment of unitedstates jurisdiction in samoa in 1900 the samoan people had inhabited the islands for thousands of years the people had long recognized the vulnerability of animal and sea life and had incorporated strict conservation methods as part of their way of life in addition it was customary for the chiefs to monitor the population sizes of various species of fish once the number of fish neared the threshold of endangering the continuing viability of the species a temporary ban on taking that type of fish would be instituted the ban which is called tapu in samoan would not be lifted until the chiefs determined that an adequate population base existed given the samoans historical concern for the environment it is not surprising that there is widespread support in samoa for a park that would continue to preserve the islands natural resources under h r 4818 the park will also seek to potect the traditions and customs of samoa subsistence farming and subsistence reef fishing as have been traditionally used in the past will be allowed to continue in addition the access to park areas will provide for the traditional subsistence harvesting of breadfruit coconuts yams kava wild fruits and vegetables and plants for medicinal purposes the park will also permit the careful and customarily limited extraction of native trees to be used in traditional samoan houses and ware as land in samoa is such an important issue the legislation provides that the boundaries of the proposed park area will be clearly defined and mutually agreed to by the governor and respective villages before publication of the park maps h r 4818 also requires the secretary of the interior to develop a program to train native american samoans to work in the park and to extend a hiring preference to these individuals to ensure that the park employees are familiar with the samoan islands the people language and traditions i am confident that there are adequate native american samoans as clearly defined in the bill qualified to meet the staffing needs of the park the real employment opportunities that the national park offers however will be generated from business established in samoa to support the increase of visitors the villages families and individuals of american samoa can provide tours food and lodging as well as other services to visitors to the national park of samoa a great deal of time and effort have been invested by many individuals and organizations to help make the dream of a national park of american samoa to become a reality the national park service conducted an excellent study and recently transmitted a superb draft report to congress with recommendations for the park the chairman of the subcommittee mr vento certainly deserves recognition for his hard work on this legislation as well the subcommittee traveled to samoa last year to inspect the areas of the proposed park hold a hearing on the issue and moot with several of the high chiefs and local officials to obtain their views concerning the park i would clearly be remiss if i did not commend dr paul cox and dr merlin tuttle renowned experts on the flying fox and tropical forests dr cox and dr tuttle along with mr verne read have worked extremely hard for several years to achieve their goal of creation of a national park in samoa i am pleased we have boon able to assist them in their dedicated efforts i believe we have a unique opportunity to join with the people of samoa in the proservation of the third major tropical forest of the united states by the establishment of the national park of american samoa the establishment of the park under h r 4818 would assist in the conservation of samoas wildlife such as the flying fox and the variegated marine life of the islands reefs in a manner consistent with the peoples traditions and customs for the

the careful study that went into this refinement of the small business act nine months ago congressman david price and i hosted small business comrnmittee field hearings in north carolina to focus on the problems that small businesses have in obtaining their share of federal contracts these hearings were made possible and successful by the active participation of chairman lapalce and procurement

states in federal procurement dollars returning to our state i found the situation inexplicable and inexcusable since there are 22 federal purchasing offices in north carolina with nine of these

its own sba procurement center representative or pcr to work with contracting officers at these facilities and ensure that small businesses were given a fair shot at contracts i was dismayed to discover that responsibility for procurement throughout the entire state of north carolina was covered by a pcr stationed in charleston sc whose responsibilities inciuded both the carolinas this is

conclusion is that we would be very lucky if anything lived on the earth despite my very grave doubts about sdi being a valuable defense system we cannot fail to have a robust research program why is that because we cannot fail to do that because the soviets undoubtedly have such a program and it would be dangerous for us not to do likewise so we must study the matter and a robust research program is in order expert testimony to the committee on armed services has shown clearly that a robust research program can be carried out for 3 billion or less per year as a matter of fact it is much less than that this is the testimony of dr robert sproull of the sdi science advisory board dr peter zimmerman of the carnegie endowment and dr robert cooper former head of the defense advance research projects agency in the reagan administration in fact many experts such as dr harold brown former secretary of defense consider 3 billion if far too much money and they may be right so our amendment gives sdi even more than the specialists and experts say it needs 3 5 billion splits the difference between what the house voted last year and what the conference gave us as a final figure last year the house funded sdi at 3 1 billion but the conference came out with just under 4 billion this year the other body wants 4 6 billion that is vastly too large our amendment stabilizes the sdi program all witnesses before the committee on armed services argued for a stable figure those that wanted a large figure those that wanted a smaller figure all said it ought to be a stable figure our amendment does just that by voting for our amendment the house would prevent a rusjlto deploy inadequate and destabilizing weapons into space over half of the money we authorize will be used by sdi officials to test prototype weapons for their planned strategic defense system and that is not really an ordinary research program our amendment prevents a crash program and it preserves all of our very much needed research program so i hope everybody will vote for the research not for the deployment not for rushing into the deployment of something that may be injurious to our own country and to mankind as a whole"], [0.0004500150680541992, 0.5004500150680542, 1, "madamspeaker for purposesof debate only i yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from ohio mr eckarti mr eckart asked and was given permission to irevise and extend his remarks"], [0.0005288124084472656, 0.5005288124084473, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i will vote against this bill i do not suppose i have ever been as disappointed with any piece of legislation that has come out of this body as i am with this one i will vote against it and if it should pass i would do all i can to make sure that it does not become law for several reasons the first reason is that the ratepayers of this country are asked to increase their payments for electricity for this particular item by 121 2 times at the present time a utility must pay 5 million per reactor under the present law it will go up to 63 million per reactor under this proposal the utility does not pay that the only place the utility has to get that money is from the ratepayers and of course the rate will be increased for every ratepayer in this country it goes from 5 million to 63 million for every reactor in this country for all 108 or 110 whatever number that is the present limit of liability is 700 million and it goes up to 7 billion around here we throw figures like i do not know what because 7 billion who knows how much that is it is just a figure that is so big that it is almost impossible to comprehend no one seems to care the industry does not seem to care that it went up that much they decided we better take that amount because it could get worse later i could get worse later and one of the times that it might get worse later is that this bill is for a period of 10 years i hate to think what we are going to come up with 10 years from now that is not bad enough but what we are doing we figure maybe the utilities do not have enough money to pay this off maybe they will be too slow in paying it so we say do not worry about it the government has deep pockets so the department of energy will pay we even authorize the department of energy to go out and borrow money we authorize the department of energy to borrow up to 7 billion as the law now stands or as the bill now stands and with every year adjusting it for inflation it would be going up and up but that is all right because the government has deep pockets and after all it is not anybodys money so let the department of energy go ahead and borrow and we will then wait for the utilities to pay it back the nuclear waste fund is another place where the ratepayer gets nicked and that goes up millions and billions of dollars and so we have said well that is ok we will not put any limit on any accidents that result from nuclear waste activities so there is no limit on that even the 7 billionwhich we cannot understandis pretty high but no limit is certainly a lot higher than that we have another provision in here that is not very good the department of energy indemnifies all contractors for any losses that is how it should be our national laboratories are operated by contractors for the benefit of the federal government in my home state for example we have los alamos which is operated by the university of california for the benefit of the government and sandia laboratories which is operated by western electric and my understanding is it is for a fee of 1 however what the bill now says is that for those activities where the federal government indemnifies that the limit will never come down it works like this for all accidents the limit goes up by 63 million for every reactor that comes on line so that when the reactor is deactivated the limit goes down and that makes a lot of sense to me except for the 63 million but it goes up with the number of reactors being added however with the indemnification portion of this where the government is the one that picks up the tab we have found deep pockets again because for those it does not go down once it goes up by the number of reactors and we have 108 or 110 whatever the figure is it will stay at that level so every time we add one reactor it will go up but every time one is deactivated it does not go down on page 13 we have another great little provision in here and i say that facetiously so that when it shows up on the record it does not look like i really called it a great provision it is a lousy provision as a matter of fact this fund must pay for precautionary evacuations what does that mean that means that anybody authorized to evacuate because of a nuclear threat can just go ahead and do so and then we have got to pay for it we all know there is a lot of political bias against nuclear energy and someone can do that just to make nuclear energy look bad for political purposes and then of course we are going to have to pay for it we were not satisfied with the 7 billion there are now three layers under which there can be compensation for accidents there is the first layer where utilities go out and buy insurance from the private insurance companies and that is 160 million and that pays for the first layer of any accident the second layer is where the utilities pay to the federal government and the federal government then distributes that second layer or 63 million per reactor or a total of 7 billion then we are not satisfied with that 7 billion we go on and we say in this bill that there will be a third layer that if that 7 billion is not enough we know a guy that has big deep pockets his name is uncle sam and uncle sam will pick up anything over and above the 7 billion so for these reasons and many many others i would urge my colleagues to vote against this piece of legislation we are a lot better off let me tell my colleagues without this bill being enacted into law and i would urge my colleagues to vote against it and th at if it should happen to pass to do all they can in the senate and in conference to make sure that it does not get through in the final analysis if it should get through both of those bodies and through the conference i ask my colleagues to urge a veto of the legislation because it is just so bad that no amount of amending could possibly make it any better i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0005785226821899414, 0.5005785226821899, 1, "specifically we

important to members of congress and our constituents alike the bill deals with congressional salaries honoraria and tax treatment of members expenses and the retention in service of senior congressional staff i would like to take this opportunity to make a few observations about the bill one of the congressional sages with whom we have the privilege to serve our colleague mo udall has been quoted as saying that the subject of congressional pay has elicited more selfrighteousness and more passionate oratory and more posturing and more nonsense than almost any other subject the action taken earlier this week in which we again voted to exempt ourselves and other top government officials from a costofliving increase is a dismal reminder that this is a problem which we will face again and again until we do something imaginative about it last year during house debate on the presidents proposal to implement at least in part the recommendations of the commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries i rose in strong support of the pay raise at that time i suggested a new system to determine congressional paya system which would be characterized by honesty and forthrightness a number of members were caught off guard by the simplicity of my proposal the press certainly did not know what to make of it some mistook the fire in my eye for a mere twinkle i freely admit that my speech then was driven more by frustration june 16 1 988 114358 with the way we currently set our salaries than by long and careful thought since that time however i have regularly returned to the idea as the current system comes under repeated and continuing criticism upon reflection it strikes me as an idea which responsibly addresses many of the persistent problems which haunt us under the current system the bill i am introducing today gives substance to the idea in statutory language it is my hope that the bill will generate an open and constructive debate on this most difficult issue i urge my colleagues to give the bill their examination and support"], [0.0008726119995117188, 0.5008726119995117, 0, "i thank the gentleman from california for yielding this time to me and i rise in strong support of house concurrent resolution 146 i want to commend the gentleman from utah the gentleman from michigan and the gentleman from california assisted by the gentleman from florida for their efforts in crafting the proposal which we have before us today this measure of course recognizes the contributions of costa rican president arias in presenting his peace plan this initiative has very important democratization demilitarization and nonaggression features during two special orders this member previously has pointed out the details of the arias plan this resolution does applaud and encourage for the central american countries the work that has been done and generally but enthusiastically endorses it it does not mean of course that opportunities do not exist for further change and clarification this member believes for example that implementation questions deadline questions and verification questions ought to be and undoubtedly would be raised in further negotiations and solutions offered to these concerns during the upcoming meeting on the arias proposal but at this point the heads of state of costa rica guatemala el salvador and honduras have already endorsed the preamble to the arias plan and that is a very important step forward this is a peace plan proposed by a central american leader for central america and i think that fact is an extraordinary advantage that it has this gentleman would have preferred frankly to have examined some of the details of the united states policy and approved a sense of the congress resolution on americas foreign policy for central america with respect to nicaragua and central america through a legislative vehicle before the house but this is not the legislation on which to do it i reached that conclusion this morning in the foreign affairs committee when i decided against offering a controversial substitute for the resolutions we are not considering this member sent a dear colleague to members offices on house concurrent resolution 166 which would take up some of those concerns i hope the members will examine and cosponsor it i would say that the first two resolved clauses in that measure are the same as those found in the crockettowens proposal house concurrent resolution 146 before us today i will explain theother two in detail by extensions the following is the wording of the resolved clause of house concurrent resolution 166 resolved by the house of representatives the senate concurring that 1 the congress applauds the recent bold initiative by president oscar arias sanchez of costa rica and congratulates him on the significant contribution he has made by this initiative toward ending armed conflict and reinforcing democracy in central america 2 the congress strongly supports the purpose of this initiative and urges all central america headsofstate to participate actively in a summit meeting to discuss the initiative and to cooperate in this effort to reach a negotiated settlement of the conflict in central america 3 the congress should make such assistance to the nicaraguan resistance forces contingent upon progress within these forces in the development of broadbased civilian leadership committed to democratic norms principles processes and institu tions and to a demonstrated respect for human rights and 4 the congress should not appropriate additional fuids to aid the nicaraguan resistance forces unless a the president finds and reports to the congress and the congress by a majority vote of both houses accepts the presidents findings that i the united states firmly and formally supports the ongoing efforts led by president oscar arias sanchez of costa rica to implement by the nations of central america a plan for peace demilitarization and democratization it the united states has brought the matter of aggression and threatening actions by nicaragua against its central american neighbors including admitted support for the guerrilla forces in el salvador and the excessive nicaraguan buildup of its military forces to the attention of the organization of american states and sought imposition of collective security measures against nicaragua il either 1 the assistance to the nicaraguan resistance forces by the united states government is formally supported by the organization of american states or the nations adjacent to nicaragua or ii even if such support is not expressed the threat posed to the security of the united states by forces in nicaragua is deemed by the united states to be so fundamentally important that the national security interests of the united states require it to act through assistance to the nicaraguan resistance forces as an appropriate means to protect its own national security and iv the continued military assistance from the united states government to the nicaraguan resistance forces will not interfere with but is necessary pressure to cause acceptance by nicaragua of a regional ceasefire and adoption by nicaragua of a peace plan for democratization demilitarization and nonaggression or b the president certifies to the congress that the head of state of the government of nicaragua has not signed a peace plan i which results from and is consistent with the major elements in the initiative of president oscar arias sanchez for a ceasefire demilitarization and democratization plan for the region ii which has been formally accepted and signed by the heads of state of costa rica el salvador guatemala and honduras and iii which is formally and firmly supported by the united states i rise in strong support of house concurrent resolution 146 it should be enacted by an overwhelming vote"]]}
