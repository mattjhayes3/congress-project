over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the

there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across

either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription

senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me

companies that do business in more than one state i believe we will have a legal conversation that goes like this the corporate lawyer is going to tell the company you are subject to 50 different legal theories of liability there are 50 different rules out there and you are going to have to think long and hard if you want to stay in this business to give this back to the state where there is no uniformity is going to drive up cost and it is going to be very complicated to administer what i suggest is let us keep the federal court system as it is but allow full range of lawsuits if they have a bodily injury sue for the complete recovery of their damages but let us make it uniform so people do not lose their health care and have some damage limitations"], [0.004674375057220459,

rely on us to pick up their costs and to defend them our friends in europe can afford the cost of defending themselves and i think it is about time that they did that this amendment also has been criticized that maybe it will restrict our ability to put forces in europe around the world if we need to in a timely fashion this amendment does not remove our ability to respond to a worldwide european crisis under the current doctrine we are able to leave the equipment there as a matter of fact currently we will have with this amendment passing we will have the ability to keep the equipment tanks three brigades worth of equipment in europe which will mean that we will have the equipment there and all we will have to do is send the men or the military in a short period of time this amendment does not touch those reserve stocks we are able to respond in just a matter of hours because the equipment will be there we are only removing the personnel so with that i would ask my colleagues to support this amendment we are having a hard time getting burdensharing passed this is one way for us to do it this is one way for us to make the point that it is time that our european allies and european friends paid their fair share this will force them to do that by paying for their own defense i rise in strong support of this amendment i think we ought to take a hard look at some very serious issues regarding the defense of europe and this amendment squarely focuses us on that along with my friends the gentleman from connecticut mr shays the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank my colleagues from california mr rohrabacher and mr bilbray the gentlelady from michigan ms rivers the gentleman from vermont mr sanders the gentleman from florida mr foley and the gentleman from michigan mr upton i am offering this common sense amendment to gradually reduce our forward military presence in europe our goal is to decrease the number of troops in europe from the current level of 100 000 to 25 000 between now and 2002 its not a secret that the united states has been the primary defender of europe for the better part of this century after world war 2 we adopted the marshall plan to help us defend our allies who were facing incredible economic times following six long years of war in those days the mission was to defend our european allies from an invasion by the soviet union and warsaw pact nations as important as that mission was it doesnt take a rocketscientist to figure out the cold war has been over for a decade yet here we are continuing to subsidize europes defense it just doesnt make sense that we should continue to do this i want to stress this amendment will not reduce overall unitedstates troop levels nor will it preclude the united states from participating in military operations in europe however it finally restores european responsibility for defending its own borders while unitedstates subsidies for western europes defense made sense during the cold war these expenditures are no longer necessary is it any wonder that while great britain saw fit to decrease its governments defense spending from 24 percent to their gnp in 1951 to less than seven percent in 1997 it boosted social spending from 22 percent to 53 percent during the same time period the answer is a resounding no our wealthy european allieswhose gnpgrowth has actually outpaced our own economic growth deliberately underfund their defense spending because they fully expect us to bear the costs of protecting them when they are fully capable of doing so themselves its time to let them do so why is it that we spend 100 billion more than all the other nato nations combined when their gnp and population base is larger than ours it just doesnt pass the common sense test not now not ever i know there are some who may question whether this leaves us in a precarious situation as far as defending europe is concerned i want to be very clear about this this amendment doesnt remove our ability to respond to world wide or european crises such as the current military operations in yugoslavia in fact it enhances our ability by ensuring our forces remain mobile and prepared to respond to emergencies around the globe this amendment doesnt effect our prepositioned war reserve stocks in europe currently we have 3 brigades worth of equipmenttanks and mechanized infantryassigned to europe the methodology of placing 10 battalions worth of equipment and material in strategic locations is sound our amendment doesnt affect these reserves those numbers do not change under this legislation the equipment that is currently readily available to unitedstates forces in the event of war or other emergency will continue to be readily available with this amendment i urge my colleagues to support this amendment"], [0.004707038402557373, 0.5047070384025574, 0, "if the gentleman will continue to yield i have heard some comment by members that some of the emergency supplemental funding will actually be coming out of the social security trust fund in other words if congress had made the pledge that every dollar of the surplus is to go to the social security trust fund are we not really spending that social security dollar on defense we have also recognized that there will be funding in the surplus for payments on the national debt and a tax cut for any dollar that is over and above that allotment towards social security i will concur with the gentlemans comment that one of the first requirements of a government is to protect its people i think what makes me very uncomfortable the gentleman and i and those that serve in this body it is easy to be the critic of the president or those in the pentagon but we have to become very constructive because we are responsible the constitution does it not i would ask the gentleman from california places us with the singular responsibility to build the force and make sure that it has what it needs to meet the legitimate needs of this nation so when the gentleman laid out the scenario of what happened in korea after world war ii the gentleman almost laid out the scenario that history is about to repeat itself that those of us myself and the comrades who served in the gulf war america and the world was impressed with our hightech military force so much so that no one would dare take on the united states military especially in an airland war and that we could move anywhere in the world we want so in the face of such a deterrent we drew down the force so rapidly and so quickly that now in force structure it is there we have people they are not as wellequipped as we would like they are not as welltrained and oh by the way if we have to use them i guess we will try to use what ammo we can and we will never be in a twowar scenario anyway we hear that rhetoric around the town but i would say to the gentleman from california if we do this plusup in this emergency

i have a problem with the child or grandchild of an average working family having to take their credit card from their generation to give bill gates a tax cut as has passed the house this year i think that is unfair going back to the comments of the gentlewoman from florida minute ago it is the payfor philosophy and rules of the congress that have gotten out of this terrible hole where we are mortgaging our childrens futures of the 1980s before we came to the house it is the freelunch bunch mentality of tax cuts do not cost anybody anything and let us not offset tax cuts with spending cuts it is that freelunch bunch mentality that got us is in trouble in the 1980s just as we are climbing out of that horrible hole what a horrible mistake for our children and grandchildren it would be to

r 883 and i thank the chairman and the committee staff for getting this bill done in such good form and to the floor so quickly i am glad that i am speaking right after the gentleman from minnesota because he made the statement that we all know this is about yellowstone national park and i represent wyoming which has the most of yellowstone national park and he said that the u n is doing a good job by these designations that the reason that yellowstone was designated because a mine was going to be developed north of yellowstone that might affect the watershed let me tell my colleagues the rest of the story for 2 years an environmental impact statement had been going on and professional scientists were not able in 2 years time to determine whether or not that developing that mine would put yellowstone national park in jeopardy they were working toward that but they still had more work to do before they professionally could say that was true in 3 days time the united nations came in three days later they determined that this indeed was an area in jeopardy and then it was designated an area in jeopardy so if that is what the gentleman from minnesota thinks is a good job i certainly would have to disagree with him i do agree with him however on the fact that what this argument boils down to are these transboundary issues as far back as 1818 the united states supreme court ruled in the united states v bevins that a states right to control property within its borders was an essential part of its sovereignty and i think that h r 883 is yet another affirmation of that principle what was done when this designation was made around yellowstone was it virtually built a buffer zone around yellowstone it is something the administration had been trying to do for a long time but they could not get it done legislatively even though it is clearly legislative responsibility to designate public land use so they went around the back door and had the u n committee in 3 days make that designation this is a good bill this is something that americans have the right the congress has the right and the responsibility to make these designations and all we are asking is
