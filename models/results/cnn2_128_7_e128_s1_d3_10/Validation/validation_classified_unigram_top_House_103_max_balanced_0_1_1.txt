portion of the budget that budget amendment included the provision now being jointly offered on a bipartisan basis by mr kanjorski and mr shays the purpose of the national endowment for democracy is certainly laudable although ned is often thought of as the main entity working to promote democratic development around the world there are in fact many different unitedstates government programs and funding mechanisms working in this field these range from aid judicial reform programs to unitedstates broadcasting services such as voa and radio free europe virtually all aspects of programs run by the unitedstates information agency in some way address the issue of democratic development as well moreover ned has a long history of poor budgetary and administrative practices in 1986 the gao issued a harshly critical report which ned promised to address then in 1991 the gao issued a followup report which found that ned had taken no real action to improve its budget and program oversight procedures faced with possible defunding 2 years ago ned did adopt a plan to respond to the gaos criticism a year ago the gao reported that if ned this time actually followed through the plan had the potential of improving its financial operations this episode points to an increasing concern i have had with ned over the past few years while i have no objection with the endowments stated purpose i believe that an annual legislative earmark for federal funding of this private institution has actually harmed neds effectiveness frankly i believe that this earmark has not only reduced the incentive for ned to conduct rigorous evaluation of its own programs and their effectiveness it has also led to a low level of agency oversight and direction compared to programs directly administered by the unitedstates government i have also been concerned by the continued rapid growth of federal funding for this private organization from fiscal year 1990 to fiscal year 1993 spending on ned doubled to the current funding level of 30 million this bill proposed to increase neds funding by another 60 percent to 48 million this is the single largest percentage increase contained in the entire bill i think we should be clear on what this amendment does not do it does not terminate the national endowment for democracy despite the word national in its name ned is a private organization while most of neds funding come from the unitedstates taxpayers the endowment and its fourcore grantees do raise private funds for their work certainly they could and should do more also it is still possible under this amendment for ned to receive federal funding all this amendment does is eliminate the 48million earmark for ned contained in this bill the endowment could still compete with other organizations for specific grants through usia or aid removing the earmark removes neds sense of an everexpanding entitlement to unitedstates taxpayer funds having to compete on a level playing field for federal funding will force ned to justify every proposed project this will not only vastly improve oversight over the endowments activities but will help ensure that all such activities are fully compatible with unitedstates foreign policy goals so again i would like to acknowledge this amendments fiscal responsibility with its passage it will further reduce this bills authorization below the fiscal year

would extract a huge amount of money from the pockets of the farmers that all of us represent in this country this btu tax by comparison has a much smaller hit i would also point out that i would say to those who are concerned about the btu tax and would like to escape that 3year 14 or 17 a month that it will cost them in the third year when it is fully effective i would simply say take a look at your kids as they are leaving high school and leaving college and ask yourself what kind of job opportunity you have available for them my youngest son just graduated from the university of wisconsin 2 weeks ago the job market that he is facing today is far tougher than the job market that faced my oldest son 10 years ago and it is much much tougher than the job market that faced the gentleman or

lot better i would also suggest that for those who think that a plan such as the boren plan in the other body which has been offered if they think that that is the answer by eliminating 40 billion in taxes on the very wealthy and by increasing the hit on social security recipients and the poor by 40 billion as that plan does if they think that is the answer they must be talking to different human

typical speech at this time of our session but rather a report to this body from a very important group of constituents in my district the 19th congressional district of ohio and that is the young people students young adults in the 19th congressional district i have never been more proud of my constituents than i have been on the many occasions virtually every week that i have had the chance to visit one school or another in my district and talk to the students of all ages about their views of their community our state our nation and the problems that face us during the presidents day recess i conducted a series of very special seminars with the high school students throughout my district the subject of the seminars was the problem of crime i represent three different counties in the state of ohio ashtabula county lake county and cuyahoga county in each of those communities the superintendents and principals of the high schools were good enough to bring together students from all of the different high schools public and private into a seminar setting where i could meet with them discuss with them the issue of crime and learn from them what they would like congress to do i explained to the students in each of these seminars that their views on issues are as important as the views of their parents they are as important as the views of any of my constituents in the district their ideas are as valid their perceptions about what is happening in our community are real that i feel all too often we in public life neglect to ask the young people in our communities for their opinions i told them that what we are trying to do in these seminars was to reinstitute the process of building a community you know at the beginning of the 19th century alexis de tocqueville wrote admiringly of the process that americans go through in their commu nities where they meet together talk together discuss sometimes we argue and debate but we solve our problems through that process together the students educators law enforcement officials in my district and i participated in this process we educated each other learned from each other in a giveandtake that i hope had an impact on all of us the students in all of our districts participated all three of our districts participated in the debate over such issues as gun control drugs in the schools gangs criminal sentencing prisons community involvement role models and other questions the students understood often better than the adults what commonsense solutions we need to address this most distressing problem in our country the problem of crime i asked the students three questions first what are the problems that you face in your communities and in your schools second what are your ideas about what we ought to be doing to solve the crime problem in your schools and in your communities and third what are your comments or suggestions about the various issues that the congress is proposing to deal with the problem of crime let me go through each of these questions and just highlight a few of the answers that i received from the students in my district on the question of what the problems are that they face in their communities i was quite disturbed to hear some of the answers first they were concerned about the easy accessibility of alcohol of drugs and even of cigarettes to minors to people who should not be able to get any of these substances they said that it is not a problem for them to have alcohol brought for them by adults to have alcohol provided to them at events outside of the schools that it is not a problem for them to get their hands on drugs if they need to and as i said even some students mentioned the fact that if they can walk into stores and be sold cigaretteseven when they are under age that that in itself sends a message about what kind of a community it is that we have provided for them they also mentioned a very troubling thing about the use of drugs and that is that in their opinion the peer pressure that should be working against the use of alcohol and other addictive drugsand of course alcohol is an addictive drug i separate it out only because our lawsprovide a different set of rules with respect to these two different kinds of addictive drugs but they talked about the lack of a peer pressure that is working against the use of these substances a number of them referred to the dare programs in their communities and a number of students commented that they felt that the programs were too little and too late that by the time they actually got to the dare program that their minds had already been formed some said that the dare program after getting off to an initially strong start in our communities seems to have tapered off in its effectiveness others mentioned the fact that the antidrug advertising that had been so prevalent on our televisions and our radios for years past had declined they felt that advertising was effective they wanted to see that advertising back in short they wanted us to help them with the peer pressure to make it easier for them to stay off the drugs to stay off of alcohol and finally they said that even good students even people who you would think are immune from the problem have gotten involved in gangs why they said two reasons first of all that even the good students have time on their hands time that they need to fill and second that many many people are simply afraid and they turn to gangs for safety and the security that they are lacking in the schools and the parks and the environments that we provide well then if those were the problems that the students in my district talked about what were some of the solutions that they had in mind and i have to say that it was interesting to me and enlightening to me that the students went right to the question of prevention of crime they understand the question of punishment and i will come to some of their thoughts on the question of punishment and the question of crime enforcement but the vast bulk of time and the first many comments in each of the three meetings were focused on the question of prevention and what is it that they said more than anything else and if this statement does not wake us up all across america i do not know what will what they said first of all was congressman fingerhut we need role models we need to see adults in our community we need to see our parents we need to see the teachers and the business people and the public figures and yes the entertainers and the people we see on television we need to see these people involved in our lives involved in our daily lives showing us the kinds of role models that we need to stay away from trouble and to be involved in productive and constructive activity every parent every religious leader every educational leader every business leader every community leader should have heard the students talking about the need for role models and then they talked about the need for a safe environment they need a place they want their schools to be safe so they can feel safe in them they want the parks to be safe so they can feel safe when they go off to be by themselves and to play and to socialize they need to feel that the community center are open to them that the activities that are available to them are safe and are free of the outside influences some went even beyond the need for these facilities to be safe and emphasized the need for them to be available to them at all in fact one group of students in ashtabula country oh stood up and said we have no place to go the parks have deteriorated there is no clean safe place for us to go to be together i want to comment that one public official who was there ashtabula city manager joe varquette stood up immediately invited those students to participate with him in a task force to build up the recreational activities in his community i want to applaud him for his responsiveness and i want to applaud the students who have taken him up on the offer and who i hope are working with him on this day to improve the recreational activities in the parks in ashtabula city they talked about sports programs about workstudy programs about youth clubs about counseling for the people the students among them the young people among them who they know need additional help these were the compassionate yet very sensible and reasonable ideas of our young people focused on prevention and i think that as we approach the crime debate in this congress we need to hear their voices and make sure that we are paying attention to the question of prevention of crime among our young people but they did also of course talk about the issue of law enforcement of punishment of deterrence and they were quite straightforward and quite perceptive about the failures of our criminal justice system they agreed with congress proposals to put more police on the streets on foot patrol they want that kind of safety and security visible in their community they are deeply concerned as are many of the adults i talked to that punishments that are on the books are not punishment in reality they are concerned that the court system the judicial system whether through plea bargaining or through ineffective sentencing procedures lets criminals off renders these sentences that are on the books ineffective they were concerned that if we say that we have a death penalty on the books that we ought to enforce it they do believe that if someone is in prison being in prison ought to be doing time and ought to be doing hard tin sheriff billy johnson in ashtabula county talked about our senator john glenn who had been a soldier had served in korea and had lived in quonset huts and he commented if it was good enough for oursoldiers in korea its certainly good enough for our prisoners students understood that being in prison has to be something that is a serious punishment that it is not something that is taken lightly in any way shape or form they felt that if you have money or if you are connected or if you are a celebrity or somehow you have special clout that you can get out of the severity of the sentences that ought to be applied to you and they felt very strongly very strongly that if we are going to have sentences the only way we are going to deter crime is by making them real making them stick and making them tough punishment but they also understood if someone is going to be in prison if they are there as a result of drugs that they need to have the rehabilitation services so that when they come out they are no longer addicted to drugs and they have a chance at rebuilding their life when they get out of jail these are just some of the very thoughtful comments that the students in the 19th congressional district of ohio had i offer them here tonight on this floor because in a few short weeks we will be debating the crime bill here in the house and i know that there will be many debates and many proposals and many disagreements but as i said at the outset of this rdport the opinions of the young people in my district and i am sure they are no different than those in the districts of each and every one of the members of this body are as good they are as intelligent they are as sound as our opinions and as the opinions of their parents and the other adults they understand the government must ensure the security of its citizens but also the government cannot do everything they understand that there is a responsibility that they have and their communities have to help solve this problem of crime they understand that if we work together we can prevent crime in the first place they are compassionate they are caring but they are tough i intend to take their ideas with me as i enter this debate over the crime bill and work to see that the priorities that they have set for me become the priorities of this congress i intend to work together with them to make the streets safe again for our children and for all the citizens of my district and of the country again i thank you for yielding the time and i thank the majority leader for designating this time for me to make this report on behalf of the students of my district"], [0.00043189525604248047, 0.5004318952560425, 0, "this bill is basically an antifederalemployee bill i know there are going to be different people saying different things but let me just tell my colleagues why i believe that it is not a partisan issue because the person who had this job before me former congressman joe fisher was opposed to changing and modifying and repealing the hatch act most federal employees are honest and decent people and this bill will politicize the federal work force i believe h r 20 will scuttle a policy that has been in effect from thomas jeffersons time having been raised in philadelphia in south philadelphia and seeing the political pressure that can be brought on federal employees state employees but particularly city employees this bill is absolutely wrong has anyone focused on the fact that the white house under the leadership of mack mcclarty fired five federal employees career federal employees in the travel office because they did not do what somebody wanted i saw very few members in this body stand up and speak for the travel office employees now let me tell you something about these career federal employees they almost all have legal bills of over 20 000 each when a member of congress gets in trouble what do they do oh they write their financial supporters and they get the money out of their campaign funds and they take care of their legal fees who will take care of the legal fees of these federal employees one of these individuals is my constituent who will take care of their legal fees the answer is no one no one under this bill it is a bad bill have you seen the reinventing of government that al gore wants they are talking about rifing 250 000 employees and the clinton administration wants to be able to pick what employees they buy out and move out well what is permitted will be what is expected and if you do not participate in the political activity what will happen in the old days they come by and say you know we are having a fundraiser for x today we would like you to buy five tickets at 100 apiece what will happen what will happen when they change the performance appraisal for the federal employee and the employee is bumped out what will happen to the man or woman who does not want to participate where is the support for changing the hatch act are federal employees for this bill your offices have not been called by federal employees you have been called by federal unions you have been called by the white house you have been called by special interests but i doubt if you have ever been called by federal employees i saw the last speaker the gentlewoman from virginia who now represents most of the former congressional district that i had did she get any calls from federal employees i represented 65 percent of that district and almost every federal employee said do not repeal the hatch act they said congressman it gives us the protection so we dont have to participate in and make financial contributions to they do not want it so where has the outcry been now if you want to separate out the postal service i think the chairman has a very good idea the postal employees fine but the federal employees are not asking for it in addition you are now accepting the amendment that i tried to offer which i was not given the chance to offer but you know what you have done by accepting that you have actually acknowledged by exempting irs and cia employees you have acknowledged that there is potential corruption by accepting that amendment you have acknowledged that there is a problem so you do not want coercion on the cia but it is ok to coerce the department of labor or osha you do not want to coerce the irs but it is ok to coerce meat inspectors or poultry inspectors the bill is flawed by the very nature of that fact lastly i know the votes are not here to defeat this bill because the wheels are rolling and this administration is going to sign it this bill will probably be repealed again i would hope that when the republicans take control again whenever that time may be that we repeal this because this is a bill that will bring about corruption as the son of a philadelphia policeman in the inner city i saw what can happen back in philadelphia if you even wanted a scholarship for somebody you had to know somebody and i know the next speaker is going to talk about it you had to know somebody in the state legislature or be involved in the political process we do not want that in the federal government we have an honest ethical moral highcaliber federal civil service and federal employees are not crying for this bill and i am not inferring that the gentleman would like to see that but i believe this will happen we should not get the impression that everyone is for this bill common cause is against it the new york times is against it the washington times is against it the wall street journal i heard the gentleman from new york say that is why the wall street journal is against it the wall street journal is opposed to it the washington times is opposed to it the l a times is opposed to it it is a bad bill i respect the gentlemen for their efforts to try to pass it i really think it will be bad for federal employees and be bad for the government and i believe that we will see scandal coming very very soon as a result of it"]]}
