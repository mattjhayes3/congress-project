could have resulted in the assassination of yet another american president i couldnt turn it off conlan said it was terrible horrible i cald to my wife ruth thats a sin to have something like that happen to a man like reagan as television played and replayed the gunmans attack conlans memory fluttered back only three days to when reagan had greeted him warmly at a luncheon in the white house with hello jocko how are you their association goes back to the 1930s when conlan was playing for the white sox and reagan then an aspiring young sportcaster was recreating baseball games of both the chicago white box and cubs with the aid of western unions terse playbyplay reports we didnt know each other then conlan said i first met him at loyal davis home years later the doctor who now lives in

for those attending thirtytwo members of the hall of fame showed up he was so down to earth conlan said of reagan he came right in and i happened to be standing at a table next to him he shook my hand said hello jocko and told me how nice it was of me to attend the luncheon lasted for about two hours reagan was the only speaker except for a few closing comments by baseball commissioner bowie kuhn reagan just went out and told oldtime stories of when he was announcing baseball said conlan he told of his experiencei think it was the 1938 world serieswhen billy jurges of the cubs popped up a foul ball just as the telegraph line went dead reagan improvised having jurges foul off three or four more pitches he made me look good reagan confid ed chuckling when western union service was restored reagan found that jurges eventually did foul out one of the highlights of the luncheon ac cording to conlan occurred when reagan opened up a present from oakland as man ager billy martin it was a new

religious groups denigrating remarks about any group in society concerning characteristics over which they have no control such as race and ethnicity and those which are associated with the very beginning and ending of life such as religion are immoral in themselves but in additionand this is the special concern of congressthey strike at the heart of a healthy and wholesome political system

relations among various ethnic groups from the mutual respect accorded these groups will grow a stronger and more dynamic democracy the motion picture radio and television industries have been deficient in their responsibility to help create a society in which individuals can respect their heritage and its institutions and i call upon the congress to take a stand against such abuse the members of our minority and ethnic groups should not have to witness their portrayal as criminals idiots or other undesirable characters each minority group is justifiably proud of its ancestry its accomplishments and its contributions to american society when this selfpride is threatened we jeopardize the human qualities which have most contributed to americas greatness stereotypes as presented on television can be particularly influential to the young child to a great degree we become what we see whether in life or in the media thus the challenge to the media is very great indeed since modeling implies that children will be influenced not only by being told what they should be like but by observing what people with whom they can identify are actually like or portrayed as being when the media allow and encourage aspersions to be cast upon groups portraying them as superstitious catholics dumb polacks or part of the yellow peril or as welfare blacks or as italian criminals or as the lazy bandito or the racist hardhat or the jewish loan shark then social harmony becomes a political concern the denigrated groups become defensive and hostile to other groups and to institutions which appear to be controlled by others such groups cannot help but question the worth of their allegiance to a political system which seems to affirm attacks upon them the motion picture and broadcast media have become central to the american way of life and have profound influence particularly on children the television set is a perfect instrument for those who would spawn prejudice against and prejudgment of our fellow human beings in such a situation democracy and representative government do not have a chance insulted groups harden hearts and minds to others and freedoni of

than this conference report when the senates package came over to the house and the ways and means committee failed to hold hearings offer amendments or do anything but send the package by motion to conference unchanged i was extremely upset i felt that this procedure plainly violates the constitutions specific provision requiring revenue measures to originate in the house closest to the people and most subject to their control i have three times voted not to allow the measure to proceed in this manner i commend those members who have filed suit to question this procedure in the courts and to seek a decision once and for all that the house cannot in this way abdicate its constitutional responsibility i suspect that earlier had someone asked me to join in the lawsuit i would have done so and opposed the bill solely on this ground it is unfortunate perhaps that a test case occurs on so sensitive and important a piece of legislation affect ing as this one does the presidents momentum in moving the country from economic stagnation to vibrant growth it will always be suspected that those who sue do so simply as another means of stopping legislation they oppose in my judgment the plaintiffs constitutional concern is genuine and fully justified the merits of the policy expressed in the bill however remain to be considered and a decision on them cannot be shirked or avoided i have said repeatedly that the bottom line on this measure is whether this is good economic medicine or bad clearly there are precedents for saying the latter the depression 50 years ago was the last time a general tax increase was considered and passed by the congressall others have resulted from inflationpushed bracket creepand most economists believe that one was the wrong prescription at the wrong time this one however differs substantially we have in place 930 billion of tax cuts coming on over the next 5 years and it is in this context that this 230 billion increaseover 5 yearsmust be considered the net a 700 billion tax reduction that should adequately spur consumer spending to raise us out of the economic mudpro vided one condition has taken place lower interest rates now there are those who argue that deficitslarge ones like we are having now toohave nothing to do with interest ratesthat the supply of lendable money and its consequent price are unaffected by huge government borrowing demands i find this impossible to believe rather it seems to me the prospects of everincreasing federal credit demands competing with consumer and business borrowing forces up interest rates and keeps them high in the absence of some signal to the markets and the people of our country that the pressure will be reduced i see this package as that signalthat congress has the courage to follow its own budget resolution and to take actions that will help reduce the deficit bring down interest rates and put unemployed americans back on the job the president has correctly described the package as mainly tax enforcement and reform of some of the excessesthe ornaments hung on the christmas treeof last years tax reduction legislation but just as correctlylet us not kid ourselvesthere is 98 3 billion of new revenue this bill raises clearly the people are the ones who will pay it but if fairness and equity are a part of our considerationand god help us when they cease to bethen this package commends itself yes it will require some sacrifice especially by higher income taxpayers and corporations but all segments of american society must participateequitably and fairlyif we are to succeed in turning the corner on our economys problems no one expects americans to want or like tax increases the only surprise in todays harris survey is that onethird of the people favored this measure but there are times when courage and commitment are needed in the congress the courage to recognize what must be done and to do it thats what the american people are looking for now the economic crisis is largely one of spirit the signal must be sent last year we began a program to reverse the stagnation to rebuild our economic base and to rekindle the competitive spirit in america we have accomplished much the rate of increase in federal spending has been curbed taxes have been reduced substantially and indexed for the future and excessive federal regulation has been cut back inflations back has largely been broken interest rates have been reduced by onethird and the supply of money and credit have been stabilized but because economic growth rates have not responded quickly to our policiesones which i strongly believe are correctwe face an exhorbitant federal deficit which as i have said holds interest rates captive further control on the rate of increase in future federal spending is also necessary to secure the 284 billion in additional spending cuts specified in the budget resolution the administration needed to promise some readjustmentparticularly of business deductionson the revenue side if we fail now to carry out the revenue portion of the budget resolution what expectation can there be that the spending portion will be carried out without further spending cuts the third year of the kemproth tax reduction program will soon be under siege and the prospect of preserving it in the face of even higher deficits conjectural at best my

afford legal counsel on their own it is an attempt to reaffirm this nations belief that before the law all men stand equal it is a goal that this congress set for the corporation in 1974 in my estimation the corporation has been a remarkable success in past years as appropriations or reauthorization bills for the legal services corporation have been before this congress critics have come forth with what they consider horror stories about the operations of the legal services programs across the country attempts have been made to characterize as typical the highly controversial case or the occasional instance of bad judgment by the corporation or local program i do not pretend to agree with all that each of the over 320 local programs have done but i suggest to my colleagues that the horror stories we have heard during this debate as in previous debates are the rare exception and are in no way the norm last year legal services programs handled over 1 5 million legal matters for incomeeligible clientsclients who for some reason or another came to legal aid for help many of these clients may have even been referred to legal services by our own professional staffs before we decide whether as a congress and as a nation we should abandon a program to insure minimum access to justice for lowincome persons i suggest we look at what legal services really does this past winter on a 30degree day a mother and her 6weekold child had no heat in their apartment the landlord had turned it off a local legal services lawyer invoked the law the apartment had heat once again in ohio an 80yearold woman was abandoned by her family at a migrant rest center because her family could no longer support her she was referred to a local legal services program her attorney learned that the widow had never applied for social security survivors benefits despite her eligibility for them she had never heard of social security benefits she was reunited with her family and is assured of social security benefits for the rest of her life in new york state an elderly couple was referred to legal services after signing a contract to have their home insulated for more than 1 700 independent estimates placed the cost at 400 or less the legal services attorney claimed unconsclonability and truthinlending violations the insulating company canceled the contract and performed the job for 442 including finance charges in missouri a legal services progran recovered damages for a poor illiterate victim of a car dealer the car dealer had sold a 300 truck for 1 700 these are but four examples of the types of matters handled by legal services attorneys as they seek to protect the legal rights of their clients most of these legal services involve matters one might expect to confront lowincome persons roughly 30 percent of the cases involved family law problems 14 percent concurred problems of consumer finance 18 percent dealt with housing problems and 17 percent centered on problems of income maintenance these may appear to be mundane mattersbut to the individual client like the four i just mentioned they are extremely important these few examples real examples of how legal services affect the lives of this nations disadvantaged demonstrate the need for continuation of the legal services program i ask you can we now say to that mother and newborn baby in florida to
