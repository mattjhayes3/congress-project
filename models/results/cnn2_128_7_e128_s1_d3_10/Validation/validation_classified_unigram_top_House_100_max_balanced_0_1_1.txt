maryland did not send a representative the few individuals who attended the annapolis convention agreed that the goverrnent had to be changed the central government was too weak t~o handle the

not talk about it nobody said that that was not said"], [0.0013294219970703125, 0.5013294219970703, 1, "i rise today in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from north carolina to require the state department to submit a report to congress on the human rights situation in tibet and to earmark funds in the migration and refugee assistance program for assistance to tibetan refugees the west is too little aware of the tragedy of tibet long an independent country it was invaded by the peoples republic of china in 1959 and has been occupied ever since during this occupation living standards for the tibetans have dropped dramatically with onesixth of the population having died between 1949 and 1979 for those who have survived the economic deprivation there has been the additional threat and reality of forced labor imprisonment and the loss of human dignity one out of ten tibetans have been imprisoned at some time in their lives and tens of thousands of others held in labor camps the tibetans unique cultural heritage has also been savaged 6 254 monasteries have been destroyed their art and statuary either melted into bullion or sold for foreign exchange at least 60 percent of tibets philosophic historic and biographic literature burned in just 20 short years 2 100 years of civilization was destroyed but there is still a dearth of information on the true situation in tibet today which i hope this amendment will remedy in closing i would like to quote the spiritual and temporal leader of tibet his holiness the dalai lama this passage is from his book my land and my people when the chinese communist armies marched into tibet in 1950 and occupied the eastern part of it i and my people found ourselves in a helplessand almost hopeless situation we appealed to several of the leading nations of the world and to the united nations to intervene on our behalf but our pleas for help were rejected it was many centuries since tibet had been a military power for we believe in the path of peace and have tried to follow it ever since the wisdom of lord buddha was brought to our country from india over a thousand years ago and since our national life was devoted to our religion our material resources were very small so denied the help of other nations we were soon overwhelmed by the armed might of china we sent delegation to peking in the hope of making an honorable treaty but it was coerced by threats into signing away our sovereignty our government never ratified the agreement which was forced on us but it was clear to all of us that if we rejected it more bloodshed and destruction would inevitably follow to save my people from worse disaster i and my government tried to abide by the agreement unjust though it was but the chinese broke every promise they had made in it the grim tragedy which followed in tibet has been told in great detail in the reports of the international commission of jurists in this book i have tried to give a more personal account of our life in tibet and of the sad events which for the present have brought it to an end i have also mentioned some principles of buddhism and the religious course from suffering to the path of happiness for nobody can understand tibet without some understanding of our religion i am a steadfast follower of the doctrine of nonviolence which was first preached by lord buddha whose divine wisdom is absolute and infallible and was practiced in our own time by the indian saint and leader mahatma gandhi so from the very beginning i was strongly opposed to any resort to arms as a means of regaining our freedom all my efforts through these years were spent in a search for a just and peaceful settlement with china and i tried my best to discourage violence even at the risk of displeasing some of my own people for 9 years i managed to persuade those of my people who were still under the authority of the tibet an government not to take arms against the chinese oppression because i believed that course would be immoral and knew it would cause havoc on both sides but in the eastern part of the country which had already been invaded neither i nor my government had any means of communication through which we could use our influence on the people and there they rose in revolt against the chinese finally the oppression by the invaders throughout the country became intolerable and the patience of my people broke this is the story i have done my best to tell in manner which everyone will understand and i am happy to leave my readers to form their own conclusions but i must add that we tibetans still have no feeling of hatred for the great chinese people although their representatives in tibet have treated us so barbarously our only wish is to live our own lives in peace and friendship with all our neighbors including the chinese but for that we appeal to all men and women all over the world who value tolerance and gentleness"]]}
