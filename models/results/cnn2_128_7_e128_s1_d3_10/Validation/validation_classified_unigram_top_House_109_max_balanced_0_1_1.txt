democratic caucus and i want to read some assessments that are almost unbelievable things that we have been saying but finally now the best and the brightest of the national security teams across the countries the spy agencies professionals in the business are saying this they are saying that although the intelligence officials agree that the united states has damaged al qaeda which we have probably through afghanistan more so than iraq the original front that we all agreed on that we disrupted their abilities to plan and direct major operations radical islamic networks have spread and decentralized we poured gasoline on a fire when we went into iraq and we need to make that point many of the new cells the nie conclude have no connection to any central structure and arose independently the members of the cells communicate only among themselves and derive their inspiration ideology and tactics from the more than 5 000 radical islamic web sites they spread the message that the war in iraq is a western attempt to conquer islam by first occupying iraq and establishing a permanent presence in the middle east what we have to realize here and i think what the president needs to realize and the lack of oversight by the republican congress what we need to realize here is that it is not our view that matters it is what do they think how do they see our response if average people in the middle east see us as being detrimental to their interest their ideology spreads so this attempt in iraq has really poured gasoline on the fire i think at the end of the day it has made us less safe and it is not our saying it i think we need to make this point very clearly is saddam hussein being gone a good thing yes but overall take a step back and look at the big picture if you are creating thousands and thousands of more terrorists who are decentralized and spread across the world who are looking to hit the united states and make the bulls eye much bigger i think it

safe not me not kendrick meek not debbie wasserman schultz not bill delahunt not nancy pelosi not harry reid not chuck schumer but independent professionals have made this assessment and said that the war in iraq has made the country less safe and even those people who said maybeiit was a good idea to go in it was the administration and the execution afterwards that has made us less safe because we went in there with no plan we went in there without enough troops we went in there and didnt do the job we went in there without the proper approach to figure this whole thing out and at the end of the day it is not our saying it and i take no pride in saying that we are less safe now because our constitutional obligation when we swear and put our hand up is to make sure that we protect this country i take no pride in this but what we have to do is take this information and fix it and the republican majority has made no attempts to try to fix this everything has been politics mr delahunt everything has been how do we smooth this over how do we make this look good how do we come out and stay the course and put a banner up mission accomplished and when that banner does not work you put

sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this is facts not fiction the unitedstates department of the treasury backs this up 1 01 trillion borrowed in 224 years since 1776 to the year 2000 versus 1 05

consume on tuesday president bush said that he took responsibility for the recent failure of the federal government to fulfill its ultimate duty of saving the lives of its own people within its own borders but what does responsibility mean if it means anything it means the sincere concern for what has happened under his watch it means stopping at nothing to find out why a nation led by officials who claim to care about keeping americans safe presided over a recovery effort which left behind so many innocent men women and children as they were crying out for help it means caring about the truth and it means putting people before politics today this congress has to offer the american people its own definition of responsibility the appalling aftermath of hurricane katrina which swept over citizens from louisiana to alabama to mississippi was the product of a combination of failures failures of planning failures of execution failures of accountability it is the responsibility of this body to examine why our federal government was behind so many of those failures there is only one way to do this and only one path the public will respect only one route to producing real answers to real questions which the american people will trust we need a 9illtype commission for hurricane katrina the 9 11 commission was our governments response to the tragedy of september 11 2001 and after an exhaustive study it produced a report that was trusted by the american people and by the members of our government this trust was earned the 9 11 commission was not beholden to any interests besides those of its own integrity and the good of the country this honorable response to the tragedy of september 11 puts to shame what has been proposed today in the wake of hurricane 1atrina what was perhaps our federal governments greatest failure to date to defend life at home is being met with a failure of leadership and openness and honesty in this chamber today the republican leadership of the house and senate has called for the creation of an overtly partisan congressional committee to investigate the governments pre and postkatrina actions they have speoified thatit would be a committee appointed by republicans with a republican majority they would give republicans control of every aspect of the proceedings and they alone would control who would be subpoenaed they alone would control which documents could be examined and they alone would control the scope of the investigation they would have the power to take the investigation in any direction they chose with no checks no balances and no incentives to get real answers they have nominated the fox to guard the hen house i do not object to such a plan because republicans would be in control as opposed to democrats i object to it because it is the republican party which controls the levers of government and as such manages fema and the department of homeland security and every other federal institution which must be examined the conflicts of interest that are present are so obvious that it is incredible anyone would deny them but the members of the majority do not only do this but they put forth one justification after another for their plan each one less convincing than the one before it they tell us that the structure of the committee is based on precedent and cite the bipartisan commission which investigated the irancontra affair as evidence of this never mind that in that situation a republican president was being investigated by a democratically controlled committee eliminating the political pressure to sweep truths under the rug last night in the committee on rules they told us rather incredibly that nobody is better to evaluate in this body than its own members but the american people do hot believe that after all accountability has not exactly been the hallmark of this republican leadership this majority did not investigate those who concealed the department of health and human services real estimate of how much the 2003 medicare legislation that we passed would cost it did not investigate the role of top bush campaign contributors in writing vice president cheneys energy plan it did not investigate the valerie plame scandal it did not investigate what led to our dehumanizing and shameful treatment of detainees at guantanamo bay in cuba and abu ghraib in iraq why did these investigations not take place the majority has no answer except promising to us that this time things will be different last night the chairman did offer his personal assurances again and again that the commission would allow the democrats to ask questions it probably hever occurred to us that we would not have been able to do that but this is ultimately a promise that he cannot keep only allowing a handpicked group of witnesses to be questioned prejudices the investigation before it has even begun if a true interest in a fair open thorough and independent investigation runs that deep with my republican colleagues why not just create the independent panel that is the central question i have for my colleagues today why will you not support the creation of an independent commission what are you afraid of the american people clearly had faith in the 9 11 commission model why do you not a commission controlled by the politicians of one party charged with investigating itself will face tremendous internal political pressure to eliminate embarrassing truths from the public eye to defer blame and to hide facts that is the fundamental truth because we all know how politics works politics by the way is exactly why those recent scandals i just mentioned were never investigated is the creation of an independent commission an abdication of our responsibility absolutely not in fact exactly the opposite is the case if we intentionally create a partisan political investigation that would be an abdication of our responsibilities the american people need answers they need true accountability and the only way that we can live up to our responsibility and give them answers they can trust is through an independent commission the public already overwhelmingly supports the creation of such an independent commission by 76 percent and over 160 members of this body representing more than 100 million of our nations people have already supported the creation of such a commission through a substitute resolution by the gentleman from florida my colleague its findings would not just help us to prevent another terrible disaster from taking place they would also help our government to regain its credibility in the eyes of the public a newsweek poll from earlier this week found that fully 57 percent of the general population has doubts that government officials will respond well the next time a disaster strikes those doubts would not be reduced until people believe that a real independent investigation of katrina has taken place but the findings of the congressional commission being proposed by the republican leadership will be forever tainted by the pervasive public belief that details were overlooked or truths hidden for political reasons we have plenty of evidence to believe that 2 weeks ago our government missed an opportunity to rise to the occasion when it was sorely needed the consequences were worse than we could have imagined we cannot afford to miss another opportunity here today and we object to the fact that this resolution is titled bipartisan commission because truly there willnot be one i reserve

cap and that there is discretion based upon certain factors so a violation is not automatically going to cost an artist that amount of money furthermore an artist is not likely to be fined for a broadcaster placing their recorded performance on the air unless they had knowledge that it would be played or that they intended for that performance to be played on the public airwaves such an

gentleman from iowa alluded to in fact what we are doing here today if the base bill should become law is we are disrespecting the rule of law we are walking away from our treaty obligation now we have been accused of embracing the concept of unilateralism i cannot imagine i cannot imagine what the rest of the world is contemplating as we are here debating whether we simply will abrogate without a formal process of abrogation renouncing the charter just simply not meeting our charter obligations in many respects this is not just simply about the united nations this is about the rule of law do we pick and select and choose what treaties we have ratified and are signatory to which ones we will abide by i do not have to repeat the arguments the eloquent and i think accurate arguments put forth by the gentleman from iowa but that is what we are doing here if the base bill should pass we will preach and speak about respect for the rule of law which is obviously essential in democracy but by our action we will open ourselves to charges of hypocrisy we do not need that now in this time where our own gao is telling us that there is increasing antiamericanism spreading

this goes to a critical function a function of the department which actually could produce more dollars and make america more secure the department of homeland securitys office of inspector general has done tremendous work they have saved the taxpayers millions of dollars they have uncovered fraud and abuse right from the beginning the 500 000 that was spent on art silk plants and other frou frou things at the new headquarters that was uncovered by the oig the oig was then detailed 75 people out of an already inadequately staffed office to help with katrina oversight they found 10 000 mobile homes at a cost of 301 7 million vacant and sinking into the mud in arkansas 3 million in overcharges for food and lodging provided to disaster responders a million dollars in overbilling by one company for hotel rooms for disaster evacuees as of this date the office of the inspector general has unfortunately had to continue to detail 75 people to the katrina and the disaster recovery oversight that is bringing about approximately a 15 million shortfall yes there is a minimal increase in their budget but it is about 15 million short of what they need they not only find fraud and abuse and overt waste but make america more secure by spending those dollars more wisely i am familiar with their work in the area of aviation security they have been showing us the holes in the aviation security system in baggage screening in passenger screening and other areas absolutely vital function again they have been cut back because of the redeployment and the reassignment of the people to deal with the katrina recovery effort and it is not at all certain that those people will be coming back for years so i think it is essential that we find more funds to have more personnel full time qualified personnel in this office and in the end the taxpayers will come out ahead we will avoid waste and we will more efficiently spend the dollars we have i know the chairman will raise concerns about the secretarys budget i would suggest another place perhaps that could be cut in the overhead budget is the 21 2 million limousine contract now granted that is a 3year contract but that is 7 million a year up from 3 8 million last year there have been some revelations and this certainly isnt for security purposes since as i understand it the owner of the company is a convicted felon so i do not think we are providing security to senior level dhs people by putting them in limousines of a company owned by a felon i would wonder how many people there are that need limousines there at the department of homeland security 7 million a year i mean if there are 100 people that is 700 000 a year i cant even image there are 100 people who need limousine services there are a lot of caps floating around d c loose i would suggest we could dramatically reduce the limousine budget and i am sure there are a few other places we could find in the secretarys overhead aid we could rededicate that money to the office of the inspector general and we could squeeze out the fraud and abuse and better serve our taxpayers and make the country more secure so i am hopeful that the chairman would be willing to look favorably upon this amendment to help the oig deal with their current backlog this is as of march i did not ask for an update they had 4 151 allegations of fraud an d abuse on file and they have been able to investigate 429 of the 4 151 allegations of abuse you cannot tell me that they are overfunded or even near adequately funded when there is nearly 3 800 pending investigations on allegations of abuse this department contracts almost onethird of their total budget is contracted they should have the most robust oig force in the federal government instead they have the smallest oig force of any agency in the federal government despite the fact that a third of all the funds that go are contracted out and that does not even include the emergency katrina issue which i addressed earlier so again i would hope the chairman could look favorably upon increasing the oig budget and accept this amendment"], [0.0006498098373413086, 0.4993501901626587, 0, "while the
