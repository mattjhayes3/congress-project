unfortunately history has willed a different story army specialist garrett fant instead returned to lake tahoe last week as a fallen hero at the age of 21 this young man sacrificed all those years all those memories all those pleasuresand all that lifein the service of his country he loved the army and he had a plan for his lifehed serve his country as a soldier for 20 years and then he would come and serve his community as a high school history teacher from everything ive learned about garrett fant he would have made a great history teacher his mother told a reporter his thought was that high school was the last stop for kids and he wanted to influence people hed have made a great family man his older brother remembers looking up to garrett as if garrett were the older brother knowing full well the dangers that surrounded him in afghanistan his foremost attention went to reassuring his family that he was safe and secure his mother said he always tried to protect me from the dangers of being over there he was just someone that if you were his family or his friendsor his countryhe gave you his all and loved you with everything above all garrett fant wanted to be a soldier his brother tried to get him to enlist with him in the navy but garrett would have none of that he was all army and had known from the time he was a little boy thats what he most wanted to do on facebook he listed his occupation as grunt telling his friends you cant spell infantry without fant he was the top marksman in his class of 1 000 i wish id known him i wish my grandchildren might one day have been his high school history students instead army specialist garrett fant takes his place in history among nine generations of american heroes who sacrificed all those precious years to protect those who couldnt protect themselves to stand up to the bullies of the world to proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof in his farewell address at west point general douglas macarthur turned his attention to fallen heroes like army specialist garrett fant and with searing insight he observed their story is known to all of you it is the story of the american man at arms my estimate of him was formed on the battlefields many many years ago and has never changed i regarded him then as i regard him now as one of the worlds noblest figures not only as one of the finest military characters but also as one of the most stainless his name and fame are the birthright of every american citizen in his youth and strength his love and loyalty he gave all that mortality can give he needs no eulogy from me or any other man and macarthur goes on to say but when i think of his patience under adversity of his courage under fire and his modesty in victory i am filled with an emotion of admiration i cannot put into words he belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism he belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom and so garrett fant became a teacher after all as shakespeare said this story shall the good man teach his son succeeding generations of students at south lake tahoe high school and also at valley oak high school in american canyon which garrett also attended will know his story every memorial day in his hometown his name will be read with a special pride that his friends and neighbors will share strangers will pass by his honored grave adorned with flags and flowers and theyll note the few years he had and the sacrifice he made and be humbled by it and perhaps inspired by it to become better citizens no history teacher can do more than that to his grieving family on behalf of a grateful nation i can only say that you do not

and a program at the kennedy center with such luminaries at that time as harry belafonte and many others it was a memorable occasion sargent shriver of course was a great leader in many different areas i met him in a reception line awhile back he didnt really much like though that id said so great to meet arnold schwarzeneggers fatherinlaw he really didnt want to be known as arnold schwarzeneggers fatherinlaw he wanted to be known and is known as the most dynamic director of the peace corps and for many others of his workswith mrs shriver on the special olympics and for a variety of other good works that he did with his life we all have our peace corps experiences i had the opportunity to serve in the neighboring country to ethiopia which was somaliaa troubled place now it was a great experience though people ask about the peace corps and i always say that one of the things you have to remember about the peace corps is that you get a lot more out of it than you really give youre serving other people but youre learning youre learning about another culture and at the same time youre learning about your own country and your own experiences because of the points of contrast what a wonderful thing it is that america has now tens of thousands of people who have served in the peace corps who have returned and who now are working in every walk of lifeworking in international organizations working in business organizations knowing different cultures knowing different languagesthereby providing a dimension to our own national life that we would otherwise not have if we did not have people who had had the experience of serving in the peace corps there is one other thing i still can remember the quizzical but interested reaction that so many people in somalia or im sure anywhere in the world had who are you why are you doing it explain that to me again the spirit was kind of catching and they would participate in all kinds of little volunteer activities and things that they hadnt necessarily thought of doing themselves of course the peace corps volunteers are not representatives of the american government they are representatives of the american people that was always emphasized very very strongly to all of us as part of our peace corps training the way we were living was among the people not behind these diplomatic bunkers that we sometimes see in the world today youre experiencing life in the country in which youre serving one thing just as an example is that peace corps volunteers of course do their assignments but theyre also people who do volunteer work of one kind or another one of the big hits was when i was in mogadishu in the peace corps i was with two other people who were peace corps lawyers at that time and there were about 50 60 people who were teachers some were community health workers and some were community school construction workers they would come to mogadishu for a couple days off for vacation time when school was down that kind of thing and five or six of them got together and started playing some american young peoples music and the next thing you know they were invited to a restaurant in mogadishu crowds of hundreds of people gathered and it was the sensation of the town for a couple weeks of course they couldnt be paid for doing this sort of thing but they might have gotten a couple of free meals from the restaurant and that kind of thing what a wonderful sort of natural way of building bridges the people in this country had never really seen something like this they werent on a tour for any of these international shows and they just thought it was the most wonderful thing to see live music played by american peace corps volunteers and that was the face of america that they

the government will not raise their taxes impose new unnecessary regulations and pick winners and losers in the marketplace theyll invest more when they invest more the company grows and the opportunity for american jobs grows with it just last week we saw a very clear picture of the different visions for job creation held by folks in washington my friends in the senate voted on but thankfully failed to pass the buffett rule the act would impose a tax hike on one class of americans and would pay for approximately 11 hours of government functioning talk about a cynical ruse serving only to divide our country for political purposes but while my democrat colleagues in the senate are working to raise taxes on americans and americas job creators the house is trying to lower them last week we passed a small business tax cut which will give businesses with fewer than 500 employees a 20 percent tax reduction off their active business income and encourage the creation of more jobs for our citizens data shows that 7 out of every 10 jobs in this country are created by companies with fewer than 500 employees my republican colleagues and i truly believe that small businesses are the backbone of our countrys economy and their success is vital to our economic recovery we continue to act proactively and as reflected in the 27 jobcreating measures passed by the house this congress alone to ensure job providers are able to create innovate and lead we hope our friends in the senate and white house will decide to join us as we say yes to american jobs for

students and his children and grandchildren they would have all told affectionate stories about how mr fant inspired them or helped them and wished him a happy and welldeserved retirement unfortunately history has willed a different story army specialist garrett fant instead returned to lake tahoe last week as a fallen hero at the age of 21 this young man sacrificed all those years all those memories all those pleasuresand all that lifein the service of his country he loved the army and he had a plan for his lifehed serve his country as a soldier for 20 years and then he would come and serve his community as a high school history teacher from everything ive learned about garrett fant he would have made a great history teacher his mother told a reporter his thought was that high school was the last stop for kids and he wanted to influence people hed have made a great family man his older brother remembers looking up to garrett as if garrett were the older brother knowing full well the dangers that surrounded him in afghanistan his foremost attention went to reassuring his family that he was safe and secure his mother said he always tried to protect me from the dangers of being over there he was just someone that if you were his family or his friendsor his countryhe gave you his all and loved you with everything above all garrett fant wanted to be a soldier his brother tried to get him to enlist with him in the navy but garrett would have none of that he was all army and had known from the time he was a little boy thats what he most wanted to do on facebook he listed his occupation as grunt telling his friends you cant spell infantry without fant he was the top marksman in his class of 1 000 i wish id known him i wish my grandchildren might one day have been his high school history students instead army specialist garrett fant takes his place in history among nine generations of american heroes who sacrificed all those precious years to protect those who couldnt protect themselves to stand up to the bullies of the world to proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof in his farewell address at west point general douglas macarthur turned his attention to fallen heroes like army specialist garrett fant and with searing insight he observed their story is known to all of you it is the story of the american man at arms my estimate of him was formed on the battlefields many many years ago and has never changed i regarded him then as i regard him now as one of the worlds noblest figures not only as one of the finest military characters but also as one of the most stainless his name and fame are the birthright of every american citizen in his youth and strength his love and loyalty he gave all that mortality can give he needs no eulogy from me or any other man and macarthur goes on to say but when i think of his patience under adversity of his courage under fire and his modesty in victory i am filled with an emotion of admiration i cannot put into words he belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism he belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom and so garrett fant became a teacher after all as shakespeare said this story shall the good man teach his son succeeding generations of students at south lake tahoe high school and also at valley oak high school in american canyon which garrett also attended will know his story every memorial day in his hometown his name will be read with a special pride that his friends and neighbors will share strangers will pass by his honored grave adorned with flags and flowers and theyll note the few years he had and the sacrifice he made and be humbled by it and perhaps inspired by it to become better citizens no history teacher can do more than that to his grieving family on behalf of a grateful nation i can only say that you do not mourn alone your pride in garrett is shared by your community by your country and by many many history teachers who will tell his story to the latest american generation"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "9 2 percent

obamas excessive spending unprecedented debt and overregulation as well as the threats of jobkilling taxes on small businesses and entrepreneurs are holding back private sector job creation in our economy american job creators fear the regulatory and fiscal environment they will face in the near future until they have some certainty they will not invest or hire we are working hard to bring back that certainty and ensure our progrowth economic environment by doing that we must cut red tape cut spending and keep taxes low but also pass legislation to expand domestic energy production and open new markets for american goods overseas we need president obama and his party to stop trying to raise taxes on job creators and instead embrace our commonsense proposal to put americans back to
