early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers a vast one at that covering threefourths of the world to bill mote that was just as exciting as man landing on the moon discovering and protecting our oceans became his passion it is not surprising to people who knew bill to understand how his passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries ecology and enhancement at florida state university he also encouraged younger people to become interested in marine life schoolchildren were exposed to the smallest creatures as well as the magnificent sharks and dolphins at mote marine laboratories aquarium a new state of the art marine mammal rescue center gives all visitors a firsthand look at the expert veterinary care that motes marine biologists provide bill will always be remembered as a promoter of education as well as an excellent educator himself he was at the helm when the jason project began at mote marine that was developed as an educational venture between dr ballard and mote marine dr ballard is using jason and jason ii remote submersibles credited with the discoveries of the titanic the bismarck and other landmark discoveries beneath the depths of our oceans mr mote was constantly expanding the depths of our understanding even to the bottom of the sea even larger than his love of the oceans was his love for education he gave not only to the studies of marine biology and oceanography but also relentlessly promoted the fields to youth and professionals alike with his own special blend of enthusiasm in 1968 mr mote was awarded the gold medal of the international oceanographic foundation many of us who knew bill mote have our own stories to tell after meeting a person like bill his energetic and passionate love for the ocean was magnetic his relentless drive passion and vigor was rivaled

let us say that a health plan sets up its definition for getting psychiatric care saying that somebody has to try to commit suicide three times before one can qualify that may sound absurd but let us just say that the plan does that a little boy goes out a teenager tries to commit suicide once tries to commit suicide twice and finally on the third time commits suicide now under the boehner bill

hundreds of people from the business community to encourage them to organize and help spread the word about the benefits of increased trade with china that will bring benefits to the garden state and i would like to discuss for a few minutes a few of these items first extending permanent normal trade relations with china is a win for fairness this agreement forces china to adhere to our rulesbased trading system without an agreement there are no rules and we have no say whatsoever in how china conducts its business with the rest of the world secondly it is a win for unitedstates workers and businesses china is an incredibly important emerging market with more than a billion consumers thirdly trade with china is a win for american values inside china through free and fair trade america will not only export many products and services but we will deliver a good oldfashioned dose of our democratic values and free market ideas fourthly international trade whether it be with china or any other nation means jobs for my state of new jersey and that is the bottom line continued prosperity for all of us out of new jerseys 4 1 million member workforce almost 600 000 people statewide from main street to fortune 500 companies are employed because of exports imports and foreign direct investment currently china ranked as new jerseys ninth largest export destination in 1998 an increase

to weigh the risks of new programs and new ideas against the successful models and the record of their 49 counterparts and colleagues throughout the rest of the country and states are in a better position to act more swiftly than the federal government is states are closer to the people the elected officials are much more accountable than the bureaucrats down the street here from where we are here at the unitedstates department of education that is the front line the states are the front lines of education reform and states differ some states have a more decentralized approach where local school districts are able to innovate each further at a more local level some states are a little more centrally controlled at their state capitals but in no case should we ever not be willing to trust the future of our children and their ability to grow intellectually to a small group of folks here in washington d c over at the department of education whose goal today facilitated by this

the house of representatives where we made a very strong commitment to veterans health care the president proposed a budget that basically flatlined it there was no increase in veterans health care and congress recognizing the importance of living up to the commitments that we have made to our veterans increased the funding by about 1 7 billion i have a few letters from folks in montana veterans health care is a pretty interesting issue in montana one of the interesting aspects of the montana experience in world war ii is that there is a larger proportion of montanas population that served in world war ii than any other state in the country that had a lot to do with the census during the 1930s montana lost a lot of population and the allocation of forces and the draft quotas were based upon population numbers that predated 1940 so montanans sent more men and women to fight in world war ii than other states did proportionately so as a consequence of that we have a larger proportion of veterans and of course we have a very large state also to deal with they just recently closed a veterans facility in miles city a veterans hospital in miles city in fact one veteran wrote to me and said im wondering what message you are trying to send to us you expanded the veterans cemetery and you closed the veterans hospital does that tell us that you have something in mind for the world war ii and korean war veterans in any event this congress has approved a budget that will increase spending to provide health care to veterans and it is extremely important that we live up to the commitment that we made to these disabled veterans and other senior citizens who are veterans who need to secure their health care budgets are about more than numbers budgets are about priorities and the budget that we just passed i think is an important one because i think it tells the american people what our priorities are for the future of america and i want to just outline again what those are i talked briefly for a few minutes about increasing spending for veterans health care but also we included in our budget a provision to set aside all of the social security taxes that are collected for social security which is something that is unique congress has not done that over the last 20 years the surpluses coming from social security as i know most of my colleagues know has been spent on other things we established a milestone we say from now forward all of the social security taxes 100 percent will be set aside to save social security we also want to strengthen our national defense i think it is obvious to everyone who is paying attention to the situation in kosovo the war in kosovo it is obvious that our military is strapped to the absolute limit we cannot fly many of our airplanes we are running short of armaments it is clear we have inadequate training or insufficient training in many cases that our men and women are being stretched to the limit and perhaps beyond it we need to put more resources to the national defense also as part of this budget there is a plan to lower taxes on the american people i think it is important for us to have some discussion about why it is important for us to lower taxes for the american people the portion of our national income today that is going to taxes to the burden of taxes of the federal government is the third highest it has ever been in the national history in fact the only time the percentage of our national income was higher going to taxes was in world war ii in 1945 and 1946 so it is a simple matter of fairness that the tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden on american families i think it is really important that we talk about and have a clear debate about where we think we ought to reduce taxes there are two areas i think that are particularly important one is eliminating the marriage penalty i think it is grossly unfair that 70 000 of my constituents in montana pay on average 1 400 more in taxes because they are married than if they were single i also believe that we need to do something about the estate tax there is not a tax that is more unfair than the estate tax the fact that we tax somebody simply because they die seems to me to be extraordinarily unfair while it is often perceived as a tax on the rich the very wealthy do not pay that tax it is working men and women small business owners and people who have saved and have been prudent with their money farmers and ranchers particularly are hard hit by the death tax we just passed on may 8 tax freedom day the american people have been working all year long until may 8 to support government now they get to work for their families one of the ways we can help them live up to the responsibilities of their families be able to provide for their families is by reducing taxes we did that in the last congress we passed the 400 per child tax credit it will go to 500 this year it is surprising how many montanans have written to me thanking me for that 400 per child tax credit saying that that is going to allow them to be able to spend more money on education for their children or perhaps even clothing or food or the necessities of the family or even maybe a family vacation but montanans are grateful for that incidentally that is 50 million more that will be made available to the citizens of montana to spend in montana which will of course strengthen the economy of the state of montana so many montanans write to me and say that both the husband and the wife have to work in order to support their family or a woman might even write and say that her husband has two jobs a fulltime job and a parttime job just to support the family forty percent of that income is going to the government that is too high of a percentage we ought to be 20 or 25 percent total going to government and the best way to do that is a downpayment with the marriage penalty"]], "top_incorrect":

hud and independent agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000 first this member would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the va hud and independent agencies appropriations subcommittee the distinguished ranking minority member and all members of the subcommittee for the important but difficult work they did under the tight budget caps imposed in 1997 once again this subcommittee undoubtedly has struggled to complete the tough task of allocating limited resources among many deserving programs as a member of the house banking committee the committee with jurisdiction over federal housing programs this member is very interested in how funds are appropriated in this area although there are numerous deserving programs included in this funding bill this member would like to emphasize five points first this member in particular would like to comment favorably upon the treatment of some housing programs section 8 section 184 section 202 and section 811 programs probably were funded as adequately as we can under the budgetary restraints in particular this member commends the 6 million appropriation for the section 184 program the american indian housing loan guarantee program which he authored this seems to be a program with excellent potential which this member notes without appropriate modesty in recognizing the support received from many colleagues is for the first time providing private mortgage fund resources for indians on reservations through a federal government guarantee program for those indian families who have in the past been otherwise unable to secure conventional financing due to the trust status of indian reservation land second this member applauds the subcommittee for reducing the duplicative efforts of the federal government in rural housing and economic development after a funding level of 32 million in fiscal year 1999 for rural housing and economic development efforts in hud the subcommittee appropriated no money in fiscal year 2000 for huds rural housing efforts however unfortunately a setaside of 10 million is still allocated from cdbg for rural housing and economic development as a longterm advocate of rural housing during my tenure in the house this member nevertheless believes that we need to be careful of duplication and waste of financial resources in the efforts of the federal governments programs for rural housing and economic development the united states department of agriculture through their rural development offices has housing and development staff located throughout each state we do not need to hire new hud community builders to duplicate their work as suggested by the administration third however this member would like to emphasize his concerns about the community development block grant cdbg provisions in this act the cdbg program is proposed to be cut from a funding level of 4 750 billion in fiscal year 1999 to 4 5 billion for fiscal year 2000 a reduction of 250 million this member would like to certainly support the restoration of funds for cdbg to the fiscal year 1999 level in the conference committee the cdbg program not only is valuable to the larger entitlement cities it gives assistance to those communities under 50 000 through state administering agencies it is a government program with minimal overhead and bureaucracy moreover the cdbg program has provided invaluable dollars to cities and rural communities for such things as affordable housing public infrastructure and economic development specifically in nebraska cdbg dollars have recently been used in rural counties to meet their recent hurryup demand for the development of important comprehensive plans and zoning ordinances as a result of concerns over the placement of megasized hog production factories with regard to cdbg this member is pleased to commend the subcommittee on reducing the overall setasides by 266 5 million as compared to last year this member has testified at the subcommittee level that the expenditure of the maximum amount of cdbg funds should be left to the allocation of the state and eligible entitlement governments as compared to selected setaside programs fourth this member would also express his opposition to the elimination of the funding for the americorps program as contemplated by this appropriations bill the funding for the americorps program should be restored in the conference committee lastly this member is aware of huds concerns with the reduced level of this subcommittees appropriation however it is important to note that overall congress is providing more than 26 billion for housing and community development across the country an increase of 2 billion from the fiscal year 1999 mark moreover 18 new hud program initiatives deserve a thorough review by the authorizing committees before they are launched according to the general accounting office hud has requested more than 700 million for these ambiguously defined and in some casesquestionable new initiatives this member definitely believes we place an emphasis on funding proven current programs instead of understanding a wide variety of new initiatives many of which lend themselves to the use of discretion for political rewards because of the necessity to fund important housing and community development programs and despite the reservations expressed this member would encourage his colleagues to support h r 2684 the va hud and independent agencies appropriations bill"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "this is indeed a defining moment we are

florida in the city of tampa at the turn of the century the world was a far different place for bill mote back in the early part of the last century teddy roosevelt was president there was a world without jet planes without television no man had flown in space it was a world that encouraged a young boy to go fishing in the beautiful waters of the gulf of mexico it was also a time that encouraged entrepreneurs and bill mote took full advantage he could not wait to venture out into the world and start his own business while he never earned a college degree bill mote was a welleducated individual whose charisma and charm paved him a very successful path in the business world mr motes love for the world extended far beyond the realm of his exciting business ventures he loved the adventure of travel and the excitement of the sea he visited many places after he sold his company and concentrated on trips that would enable him to be with marine scientists oceanographers and biologists bill recognized very early on that irresponsible global habits were endangering his beloved sea what a shame it would be that we would be destroying one of our two unexplored frontiers a vast one at that covering threefourths of the world to bill mote that was just as exciting as man landing on the moon discovering and protecting our oceans became his passion it is not surprising to people who knew bill to understand how his passion was superseded only by his generosity in his goal he definitely put his money where his heart was he met eugenie clark some may know her as the famous shark lady on pbs nature shows bill and dr clark started a partnership that would last over 35 years and would be the root of mr motes philanthropic mission to save our oceans always drawn to the water he settled on the west coast of florida in sarasota with the intent to build a marine laboratory he used what he learned from his travels and joined dr clark in establishing one of the finest marine laboratories in the world when mr mote discovered cape haze laboratory in 1965 he immediately set his mind into catapulting the small marine research facility into a worldrenowned program henceforth the mote marine laboratory named after its principal benefactor has been the catalyst for breeding and mammal programs which benefit sea life all over the world the lab first became known internationally for shark research and in 1991 congress designated mote marine laboratory as the national center for shark research bill mote who himself never had the opportunity of higher education initiated a scholar chair in fisheries ecology and enhancement at florida state university he also encouraged younger people to become interested in marine life schoolchildren were exposed to the smallest creatures as well as the magnificent sharks and dolphins at mote marine laboratories aquarium a new state of the art marine mammal rescue center gives all visitors a firsthand look at the expert veterinary care that motes marine biologists provide bill will always be remembered as a promoter of education as well as an excellent educator himself he was at the helm when the jason project began at mote marine that was developed as an educational venture between dr ballard and mote marine dr ballard is using jason and jason ii remote submersibles credited with the discoveries of the titanic the bismarck and other landmark discoveries beneath the depths of our oceans mr mote was constantly expanding the depths of our understanding even to the bottom of the sea even larger than his love of the oceans was his love for education he gave not only to the studies of marine biology and oceanography but also relentlessly promoted the fields to youth and professionals alike with his own special blend of enthusiasm in 1968 mr mote was awarded the gold medal of the international oceanographic foundation many of us who knew bill mote have our own stories to tell after meeting a

tries to commit suicide once tries to commit suicide twice and finally on the third time commits suicide now under the boehner bill that plan followed its own criteria guess what under the boehner

than a billion consumers thirdly trade with china is a win for american values inside china through free and fair trade america will not only export many products and services but we will deliver a

closer to the people the elected officials are much more accountable than the bureaucrats down the street here from where we are here at the unitedstates department of education that is the front line the states are the front lines of education reform and states differ some states have a more decentralized approach where local school districts are able to innovate each further at a more local level some states are a little more centrally controlled at their state capitals but in no case should we ever not be willing to trust the future of our children and their ability to grow intellectually to

have made to our veterans increased the funding by about 1 7 billion i have a few letters from folks in montana veterans health care is a pretty interesting issue in montana one of the interesting aspects of the montana experience in world war ii is that there is a larger proportion of montanas population that served in world war ii than any other state in the country that had a lot to do with the census during the 1930s montana lost a lot of population and the allocation of forces and the draft quotas were based upon population numbers that predated 1940 so montanans sent more men and women to fight in world war ii than other states did proportionately so as a consequence of that we have a larger proportion of veterans and of course we have a very large state also to deal with they just recently closed a veterans facility in miles city a veterans hospital in miles city in fact one veteran wrote to me and said im wondering what message you are trying to send to us you expanded the veterans cemetery and you closed the veterans hospital does that tell us that you have something in mind for the world war ii and korean war veterans in any event this congress has approved a budget that will increase spending to provide health care to veterans and it is extremely important that we live up to the commitment that we made to these disabled veterans and other senior citizens who are veterans who need to secure their health care budgets are about more than numbers budgets are about priorities and the budget that we just passed i think is an important one because i think it tells the american people what our priorities are for the future of america and i want to just outline again what those are i talked briefly for a few minutes about increasing spending for veterans health care but also we included in our budget a provision to set aside all of the social security taxes that are collected for social security which is something that is unique congress has not done that over the last 20 years the surpluses coming from social security as i know most of my colleagues know has been spent on other things we established a milestone we say from now forward all of the social security taxes 100 percent will be set aside to save social security we also want to strengthen our national defense i think it is obvious to everyone who is paying attention to the situation in kosovo the war in kosovo it is obvious that our military is strapped to the absolute limit we cannot fly many of our airplanes we are running short of armaments it is clear we have inadequate training or insufficient training in many cases that our men and women are being stretched to the limit and perhaps beyond it we need to put more resources to the national defense also as part of this budget there is a plan to lower taxes on the american people i think it is important for us to have some discussion about why it is important for us to lower taxes for the american people the portion of our national income today that is going to taxes to the burden of taxes of the federal government is the third highest it has ever been in the national history in fact the only time the percentage of our national income was higher going to taxes was in world war ii in 1945 and 1946 so it is a simple matter of fairness that the tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden on american families i think it is really important that we talk about and have a clear debate about where we think we ought to reduce taxes there are two areas i think that are particularly important one is eliminating the marriage penalty i think it is grossly unfair that 70 000 of my constituents in montana pay on average 1 400 more in taxes because they are married than if they were single i also believe that we need to do something about the estate tax there is not a tax that is more unfair than the estate tax the fact that we tax somebody simply because they die seems to me to be extraordinarily unfair while it is often perceived as a tax on the rich the very wealthy do not pay that tax it is working men and women small business owners and people who have saved and have been prudent with their money farmers and ranchers particularly are hard hit by the death tax we just passed on may 8 tax freedom day the american people have been working all year long until may 8 to support government now they get to work for their families one of the ways we can help them live up to the responsibilities of their families be able to provide for their families is by reducing taxes we did that in the last congress we passed the 400 per child tax credit it will go to 500 this year it is surprising how many montanans have written to me thanking me for that 400 per child tax credit saying that that is going to allow them to be able to spend more money on education for their children or perhaps even clothing or food or the necessities of the family or even maybe a family vacation but montanans are grateful for that incidentally that is 50 million more that will be made available to the citizens of montana to spend in montana which will of course strengthen the economy of the

to government and the best way to do that is a downpayment with the marriage penalty"]]}
