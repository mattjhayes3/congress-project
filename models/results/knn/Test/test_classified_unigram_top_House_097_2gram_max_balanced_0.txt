month ago to the epa budget and environmental protection we must vote today to bring the appropriations for epas research closer to the fiscal year 1982 appropriations level when we debated this issue

deteriorate that point has been underscored by the american chemical society which represents 125 000 chemists and engineers and which has enthusiastically endorsed the amendment to restore

scientific community including many of the best environmental scientists some of whom have become discouraged by their inability to have their work supported by funding through the epa laboratories the proposed additional funds will allow epa to increase its longrange research on emerging environmental problems it would be shortsighted to wait until such problems reach crisis proportions before attempting to develop the information that is needed for appropriate policies and regulations a lack of fundamental information is a major reason the agency has failed to meet some of the regulatory

research an area slated for drastic cuts by administration thereby allowing the agency to draw upon qualified creative experts outside epa who can assist in solving environmental problems the extramural program is critical because it is open to the entire scientific community including many of the best environmental scientists some of whom have become discouraged by their inability to have their work supported by funding through the epa laboratories the proposed additional funds will allow epa to increase its longrange research on emerging environmental problems it would be shortsighted to wait until such problems reach crisis proportions before attempting to develop the information that is needed for appropriate policies and regulations a lack of fundamental information is a major reason the agency has failed to meet some of the regulatory deadlines established by congress in summary the american chemical society believes that the house would be wise to accept the scheuer

ago on this date the us government officially recognized the three baltic republics of estonia lithuania and latvia these baltic states had been independent for approximately 4 years and the united states felt in 1922 that it was time to welcome estonia lithuania and latvia into the international arena from that moment in 1922 these new nations achieved even greater legitimacy and established a firm basis for their right to exist these small countries when grouped together occupy about the same amount of territory as new england yet they have given the world much through their culture and knowledge and will continue to do so in the future when the baltic states first became independent they were constantly under pressure from their two powerful and aggressive neighbors germany and russia estonia lithuania and latvia were the object of many political quarrels between the two huge countries nearby who fought over the natural resources available in the area eventually as everyone here tonight knows the russians entered the baltic states and took control of the governments at that time the many balts who protested were arrested sent out ot the country or killed here in the united states it is difficult to realize how hard the struggle for freedom has been for the baltic people but we cannot forget that not long ago we americans were oppressed by colonial overlords however with some assistance from friendly nations we carried through a revolution and established our freedom as the united states of america thus it is incumbent on us to vocally support those people whose nations have been forcibly invaded and occupied the inhumane actions of the soviet union cannot be legitimized simply by waiting for the nations of the west to forget all about the baltic states for that reason we have introduced a resolution in the house house resolution 526 which reaffirms the unitedstates recognition of the baltic states in 1922 fortyfour members of the house have cosponsored this resolution and i am confident that many more will do so in the near future when this measure is passed by the house of representatives it will send a strong signal to the soviet union that we have not forgotten the plight of the baltic nations i would like to enter the text of the resolution into the record"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "63 years ago today the people of latvia proudly announced to the world their existence as a free and independent nation in doing so they exercised one of the most basic of human rights the right to an identity as a people their freedom however lasted barely over two decades what happened to them is the history of all nonrussian states within the unitedstatess r a history of brutal expansionism and tyranical oppression in 1940 the soviet union forcibly and unlawfully incorporated latvia within its domain and set out systematically to destroy the countrys national cultural linguistic and religious integrity to accomplish this they practiced every tactic of terrorism imprisonment exile torture and murder it is out of outrage for this barbarous injustice that the united states along with other great western powers steadfastly maintains a policy of nonrecognition of the forcible annexation of latvia a national independence day is supposed to be a time of celebration so what do we have to celebrate latvia is still a captive nation the baltic freedom fighters who for years waged guerrilla warfare in the face of impossible odds have finally been crushed all dissident activities have been driven underground and the people of latvia are daily denied the elemental rights of human beings so what do we have to celebrate we have the fact that despite unrelenting oppression the latvians fierce love of liberty and commitment to national identity has not diminished by one jot their experience should remind us how privileged we are to live in the free world and should spur us to help people everywhere who are struggling against persecution i am honored therefore to join with latvians around the world in celebrating their independence day and i join them too in working and praying for the day when latvia will once again be free in fact as
