lite because they are leaner we call the ford bill clinton slovenly fat because it is so much bigger more intrusive and more expensive the problem areas i will focus on tonight are first the ford bill includes remedies which award malpracticelike damages in cases of denials of health benefits which will add immeasurably to the cost of health care second the ford bill mandates that all individuals give up their present health care coverage and be directed to buy only the federal governments onesizefitsall health plan composed of an hmo ppo and ffs plan as to the remedies issue the ford bill amazingly includes provisions which award malpracticelike damages that is compensatory and or punitive damages upon proof that a regional alliance or corporate alliance health plan was guilty of a wrongful denial of health benefits by malpracticelike damages i refer to compensatory damages that is those customarily awarded in negligence cases including mental distress pain and suffering and so forth by punitive damages i mean damages also awarded in negligence cases over and above compensatory damages these types of damages are what makes medical malpractice insurance so expensive to health care providersprimarily doctors compensatory and punitive damages are customarily confined to tort negligencecases such as medical malpracticenegligencecases conversely such damages are usually not awarded in contract cases that is cases construing the provisions of a contract such as for instance a health insurance policy for example no such damages have ever been awarded under employersponsored health plans operating under federallaw nor have such damages ever been a part of remedies available to the 9 million federal employees under the federal employees health benefit act therefore it is surprising to see compensatory and punitive damages included as remedies in any breach of contract case involving the administrations health care package including every alleged wrongful denial of a health plan benefit we all know the results of medical malpractice damage awards against health care providers to now provide another dose of malpracticelike damages whenever there is an allegation that benefits under a regional alliance or corporate alliance health plan were wrongfully denied is no way to control health care costs such provisions will undoubtedly encourage litigation every health claim disagreement would have the potentialof a huge jury award of the type which have plagued medical malpractice and product liability the expense will be passed on up the chain driving up health costs in addition fears of huge damage awards will result in the awarding of benefits not actually coy ered under the health care plan under the ford bill remedies for malpracticelike compensatory damages are allowed in administrative actions and compensatory and or punitive damages are allowed in court cases against both corporate alliances and health plans operating under regional alliances there is one notable exception preferential treatment is afforded to multiemployerunion plans which are exempted from any court imposed malpracticelike compensatory and or punitive damages why the lack of uniformity of remedies i think the answer is because of the strong inference of a bias toward union health plans in the construction trade in committee i offered an amendment to eliminate malpracticelike damages against all health plans so far it has been refused by the majority along party lines i hope that changes we dont need malpractice ii in health care one is enough finally the ford bill mandates that people give up their existing health care insurance coverage in return for a onewayforall federally mandated comprehensive health care plan which includes about everything except chinese acupuncture if however the mandated plan is as good as its sponsors calm then it should be able to compete successfully in the marketplace if it is that good we should not have to mandate that anyone enroll in it if it is that good it need not be a competition killer in the market of health insurance coverage and it is a killer of all existing health care plans with the exception of medicare postal union employee health plans and veterans health care it kills off all employersponsored health care plans in spite of the fact that 50 percent of employers now under the federal law known as erisa voluntarily provide health coverage for 70 percent of all employees and these employer health plans of course compete against each other and

tionthe list goes on and on no matter what big government knows bestthe citizen must accept and pay for the coverage congress deems best this is not to say that health care in america does not need repairthat is targeted reform indeed there is a consensus in congress for one or more of the following targeted reforms towit first funding medicaid up to or beyond the federal poverty level second proscribing insurance companies from refusing health insurance coverage or renewal because of preexisting health conditions third voluntary regional or national health plans protected by federal law

congressman what is the answer i said are you broadcasting from new york this week he said yes i said check it out check it in the homosexual community in new york new york homosexual activists have discovered haiti as a vacation port of call they took aids to haiti and when health people interviewed haitians and i know of what i speak dan because i am a loyal catholic people of french catholic culture when asked if they took money for homosexual services they deny it so every haitian whether he is into voodoo or practicing catholic or some protestant faith will say i have had no homosexual contact so you think it is something genetic i said dan it is new york hoinosexuals taking it to haiti and it spread in that country because they are impoverished and when tourists come down there with a lot of money it breaks down peoples moral ethos h 10000 cc and he said congressman i am going to check it out get into that he never again said haitians as a category nbc and abc were not into that and nobody was heard in this nation about haitians now where did i get all of that brilliant dialog down at the centers for disease control up at the national institutes for health out at my

during the campaign year to actually say what we were going to do after the election and sign a statement to that effect i am relatively new here i have had some surprises but the biggest surprise has been the reaction to the contract of the majority party and some of the members of the press one reaction is we cannot afford it or how are we going to pay for it as an outsider i find those questions incomprehensible how can we not afford to save money i think it is great if we can save money i think it is great if we can reduce the budget here what a strange attitude for the majority to display now i am beginning to understand what is meant by the inside the beltway mentality i come from the state of michigan which cut their budget by 1 8 billion a few yearsago the net result is a budget surplus this year the net result is that for the first time in 20 years the state of michigan has an unemployment level that is lower than the nation as a whole we can afford the contract and we can

have been clear they want more police more prisons community notification when violent sex offenders are releasedand beyond that they want the federal government to get out of the way ten days ago many of us complained that the conference report had cut prison funding below the level of the house bill nothing has changed the house bill had 13 5billion for prisons this one has 9 7 billion we said then that the claim of funding 100 000 police was a sham it is still a sham just 20 000 policenot 100 000are fully funded it is still a hoax tendays ago a bipartisan majority decided that the crime bill had 7 billion for social programs that would not reduce crime twothirds of that money remains ten days ago i rose to complain about bogus language that supposedly allowed local police to

that should have been there in the first placelanguage that had been approved by 407 members of the house and unanimously accepted in the senate no question this is one small victory for the women and

amendment to the constitution it would be a prohibition against congress borrowing money such an amendment he reasoned would defend the american people from the tyranny of government by keeping the federal government within its constitutional bounds if jefferson thought taxation without representation was bad he should see it with representation unfortunately mr jefferson never got his amendment and the government we have now is the culmination of his fears a bloated and ineffective mass that stretches itsconstitutional authority to the limit how bad is it this year with the introduction of his budget bill clinton claimed his administrations policies had solved the budget crisis his director of omb leon panetta stated that republicans would have killed to be able to offer this budget and we have been exposed to democrat after democrat crowing about the strength of the economy and their success at cutting the deficit what were they all cheering about according to clintons budget the deficit will fall to 175 billion next year then it will rise to 182 billion in 1997 256 billion in 2001 and 365 billion in 2004 in washington this is considered success obviously something stronger is needed despite these awesome numbers some groups still oppose the balanced budget amendment first they fear a balanced budget amendment will tie the hands of congress and force it to cut some programs in order to fund others in other words they fear that congress will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second there are those groups who question the effectiveness of a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work or not the answer is the balanced budget amendment will establish the framework under which congress will have to make its spending decisions congress will still have to make the spending decisions but it will be done without the openended funding option now available this is the third time in the last 4 years the house will vote on a balanced budget amendment four years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that congress didnt need the amendment to balance our budget we have the power right now they argued to deal with our deficit without amending the constitution the house defeated the amendment by seven votes since then the federal debt has grown by over 1 trillion two years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment argued that the amendment would demean the constitution tie congress hands and hurt the economy the house defeated the amendment by nine votes since then the federal debt has grown by over 500 billion let us end this deficit madness let us allow future generations of americans to decide for themselves how they want to spend their money the balanced budget amendment is not the final

authorization for the standing committees and will make allowances for the many committees that have a history of lean budgeting and fairly allocating resources the american public has indeed signalled a willingness to sacrifice but i believe their definition of sacrifice is for their elected officials to first cut spending i hope every member will contact the membership of the accounts
