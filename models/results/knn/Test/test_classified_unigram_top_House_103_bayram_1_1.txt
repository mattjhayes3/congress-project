will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and make the budget process less flexible lets pass it quickly unrestricted flexible spending is what created the deficit in the first place second

this would work on average employers nationwide pay 4 500 per year to buy health coverage for an employee family under our legislation employers would be encouraged to take 1 500 of that 4 500 and purchase a major medical insurance policy that would give employers everything they have now except the insurance policy would have a 3 000 deductible in other words the employee would pay the first 3 000 of health care costs the company would cover that possible 3 000 expense to employees by setting up a medical savings account in the employees name and depositing 3 000 in it each year whenever an employee needed medical service he would go get it wherever he chose and then would present a debit card and the bill would be paid from the 3 000 in his medical savings account anything he didnt spend at years end he would get to keep all of a sudden people have an incentive to make a choice between 200 at the emergency room or 50 at the doctors office because they are spending their own medical savings account money if a family had multiple illnesses the 3 000 would be spent from the account and then the major medical policy would kick in the employee is as well off as he is under the high premium low or no deductible plan he has today but if the employee be exercising prudence can save some of the 3 000 year after year that account can grow as a taxfree ira that money could then be used later in life to purchase longterm care or for other medical services the debate on health care reform has just begun whatever reforms we adopt we should make sure that it controls

education and labor committee another 658 pages was added to an already complex bill the house education and labor expansion of the clinton plan takes bad policy and makes it worse needless to say i am opposed to the proposal today i would like to focus on several of the amendments that i offered during the committee debate that were rejected by the majoiity one amendment i offered addressed a serious labor law concern raised by the fordclinton health care proposal that is the relationship of guaranteed comprehensive health care benefits for every worker and the continuing obligation of employers and employees to bargain collectively over such benefits as we know negotiating over health care can be one of the most contentious subjects in the collective bargaining process and it frequently leads to labor and management strife as you know under the national labor relations act issues that may be negotiated by labor and management are generally separated into two classesmandatory subjects of bargaining and permissive subject of bargaining the respective rights and obligations of unions and employers in bargaining with each other often depend on whether an issue is considered to be permissive or mandatory of course some subjects are simply illegal to bargain over such as proposals to implement a policy contrary to existing law mandatory subjects of bargaining include wages benefits working hours or working conditions health care is a mandatory subject of bargaining if management and labor bargain over a mandatory subject like health care benefits either party may insist on its position until an impasse is reached and then labor may strike or management may order a lockout thus failure to reach consensus on a mandatory subject of bargaining can prevent a collective bargaining agreement from being reached in addition during the life of an agreement already in place an employer may not order any changes in mandatory subjects previously agreed to without first bargaining with the union permissive subjects of bargaining include any other item that the union and the employer may bargain over such as internal union affairs in this case either party may try to initiate bargaining and if the other party is willing they may address the subject in the agreement however if the other party does not wish to bargain the issue is taken off the table a strike may not be ordered by a union and a lockout may not be ordered by the company the parties simply go on to other mattrs my amendment if it had been adopted would have virtually eliminated labormanagement tensions over health care issues by taking increases in health care benefit levels off of the collective bargaining table unless both of the parties the employer and the unionwant to negotiate over them my amendment would be limited to situations where labor wanted to press for increases over what is in the law or a collective bargaining agreement if the employer wanted to seek cutbacks below the agreement that would still be a mandatory subject and the union could strike now under the education and labor version of health care reform the federal government is saying to employers and their employees this is your health care benefit package we have already decided what is the best package for you and do not worry because it is a comprehensive package indeed it has even been expanded by requiring every employer to provide a comprehensive package of health care benefits the clintonford bill imposes substantial costs on companies both large and small let us be honest comprehensive health care is expensive under the clintonford plan benefits mandated by the government would include hospital care emergency services preventive care mental health and substance abuse services family planning hospice care home health and extended care services ambulance services outpatient laboratory and diagnostic services prescription drugs vision and hearing care periodic medical checkups and preventive dental services for children the ford plan and the many amendments adopted during the markup in the education and labor committee expand upon the clinton plan adding several billion in new mandated benefits this is a comprehensive package of federally mandated benefits some would even call it a cadillac plan employers will be obligated by law to provide every one of these benefits in addtion employers with union employees must continue to provide any health benefit collectively bargained prior to passage of the health security act it is ridiculous that employers would be obligated by law to negotiate over additional health care benefits or suffer the consequences of strikes we have heard a great deal from organized labor in recent years about tensions generated at the bargaining table about health care issues in fact a representative of the services employees international union testified before the house education and labor committee recently that health care is the no 1 issue at the bargaining table and the no 1 cause of strikes 1 would tend to agree that health care costs generally have been a subject of workplace tensions as employers and their employees have struggled to cope with rising costs if one of the intended effects of this bill is to reduce those tensions by ensuring a package of comprehensive benefits to every worker then my amendment would have helped ensure reduced tensions in the future by resolving that once and for all there will be no more labormanagement battles over health care i believe it is time for organized labor in america to make a choice unions can either try to achieve comprehensive benefits for employees through collective bargaining or they can try to get these benefits from the congress the system and our ability as a nation to compete effectively cannot afford both the ballenger amendment should be included in health care reform legislation to ensure that businesses do not have to risk a strike over having to provide even more i would also like to comment on two other amendments that were offered and were rejected by the full committee on rollcall votes the committee bill includes a provision that requires a health care employer who replaces another health care employer through merger consolidation acquisition or contract to provide employees who would otherwise be displaced a right to continued employment unless their positions no longer existthe provision sunsets after 5 years my amendment would have eliminated this requirement because under current labor law an employer who acquires a business is under no general obligation to retain current employees the provision in the ford bill creates a statutory entitlement to continued employment of no defined duration makes no allowance for displacement of employees for cause and gives all displaced employees preferential rehire rights for 6 months the continued employment provision creates yet another cause of action that may be advanced by employees in federal or state court subjecting employers to liability for backpay double backpay and attorneys fees finally although technically limited to health care employers the reach of the provision in the bill is very broad because the definition includes any employer that provides necessary related services including administrative food service janitorial or maintenance services to an entity that provides health care items or services my amendment to strike this provision should have been adopted because it prevents the creation of yet another employment right to be litigated in court i also offered an amendment to strike a secton of the ford bill that would require a health care employer to recognize the exclusive bargainir g agent and to assume the collective bargaining agreement of the predecessor employer if a majority of its employees were peviously covered by the agreement and if there has been no substantial change in operations this provision would sunset after 5 years of enactment the amendment would have also stricken a provisionagain sunsetting after 5 yearswhich assumes joint employer status whenever employees of a contractor to a health care employer work on the premises and are functionally integrated with the operations of that employer the provision in the ford bill concerning the collective bargaining obligation of health care employers would make significant changes in labor law without hearings or discussion of the magnitude of those changes these provisions signal the kinds of amendments to current law that might be sought by organized labor in a push for comprehensive labor law reform and should be considered at that timenot during a debate on reform of our health care system under current law while a successor employer may be obligated to recognize the exclusive bargaining agent of the previous employer it is not required to assume the previous collective bargaining agreement requiring successor health care employers to be bound by a collective bargaining agreement to which it is not a party creates a disincentive for any restructuring of

budget amendment will tie the hands of congress and force it to cut some programs in order to fund others in other words they fear that congress will have set priorities and stick with them that is not an argument against a balanced budget amendment its an argument for it if special interest groups object to the balanced budget amendment because it would restrict congress ability to spend and

a balanced budget amendment they claim it is just a feelgood measure which will fail to reduce the deficit and will add lots of unnecessary detail to the constitution someone should get the opponents of the amendment together and let them know their arguments contradict each other which is it will the balanced budget amendment will work or not the answer is the balanced budget amendment will

remember the government has never correctly estimated the cost of its programs thats why congress keeps going back to hardworking americans to ask them to pay more in taxes this case is no different

costs lowered fortunately there are other options out there if we want to control costs we should target the key cost drivers we should reform our malpractice system to eliminate the unnecessary procedures that are done simply to protect the provider if theyre dragged into court we should adopt a single insuranceform and electronic billing so that administrative costs are lowered we should tighten our fraud laws to eliminate this cost in our system we should reform our antitrust laws so that communities have the opportunity to coordinate the delivery of health care no longer will each

employers nationwide pay 4 500 per year to buy health coverage for an employee family under our legislation employers would be encouraged to take 1 500 of that 4 500 and purchase a major medical insurance policy that would give employers everything they have now except the insurance policy would have a 3 000 deductible in other words the employee would pay the first 3 000 of health care costs the company would cover that possible 3 000 expense to employees by setting up a medical savings account in the employees name and depositing 3 000 in it each year whenever an employee needed medical service he would go get it wherever he chose and then would present a debit card and the bill would be paid from the 3 000 in his medical savings account anything he didnt spend at years end he would get to keep all of a sudden people have an incentive to make a choice between 200 at the emergency room or 50 at the doctors office because they are spending their own medical savings account money if a family had multiple illnesses the 3 000 would be spent from the account and then the major medical policy would kick in the employee is as well off as he is under the high premium low or no deductible plan he has today but if the employee be exercising prudence can save some of the 3 000 year after year that account can grow as a taxfree ira that money could then be used later in life to purchase longterm care or for other medical services the debate on health care reform has just begun whatever reforms we adopt we should make sure that it controls spiraling costs and makes health insurance affoidable most important we should make sure reform leaves the patient in charge of the health care decisions not the government thats a prescription for real change"]]}
