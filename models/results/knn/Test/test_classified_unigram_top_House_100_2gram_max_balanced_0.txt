which federal grants are provided to the states what is unique about the p r program is that it is financed soley through an excise tax that is placed on the manufacturers and buyers of sporting arms and ammunitibnj archery equipment andi handguns to date june 22 1987 h 5326 pr has generated more than 1 75 billion for wildlife restoration without any cost to the general taxpayer in fiscal year 1986 alone hunters and shooters provided over 109 million toward this effort in addition state wildlife restoration projects have benefited from more than 500 million raised in matching funds through the collection of hunting license fees together these funds have helped numerous wildlife species including antelope wood duck whitetailed deer elk black bear and wild turkey the pr program has also assisted in purchasing more than 6 400 square miles of land for wildlife management purposes the program has provided the finances to support hunter education programs which instruct more than 700 000 people each year on firearms safety and outdoor ethics the pr program continues to provide the revenues to assist wildlife research programs to increase our scientific knowledge for managing wildlife populations finally through the pr program over 10 000 technical articles on wildlife and associated subjects have been published representing a substantial proportion of the worlds total knowledge on

this bill would be a very unwise move particularly at this time and in any event this is not the kind of a bill that should be brought to the house floor with the very limited debate time available under suspension of the rules this bill deserves and merits fullfledged consideration by the house fada was chartered in late 1985 like any new business startup problems were evident salaries were too high and productivity was not as good as expected but let us look at why fada was created it was needed to case the burden on fslic most of the assets that fada has assumed are among the most difficult to sell fadas task was difficult from the start while exorbitant salaries are not justified certainly competitive salaries were needed to attract qualified individuals into this field fada is now under new leadership and its performance has improved dramatically the fact are as follows fada is making a profit now 3 7 million in the first 8 months of 1988 gerald carmen the president of ceo has cut salaries and staff has been reduced from 400 to 356 carmen has consolidated offices which will save over 1 million a year fada provided to the fslic approximately 356 million from property sales loan payoffs asset restructures and settlements in the first none months of 1988 fadas total asset dispositions since receiving its first assets in 1986 now total 935 million and are expected to top 1 billion by tile end of this year with all of this taking place one must wonder what still motivates ihose who want to abolish this agency my position is that we ought to be doing what is best for the fsiic does it really make sense to fold fada within 60 days does it make sense to put 2 500 assets worth 4 billion back into the fslic allowing them to hire only 200 employees to continue fadas job i dont think it is a wise move at this time particularly when this congress is concerned with the progress and pace of shutting down insolvent institutions a constitient of mine don shackleford chairman of ohio state savings bank is now heading a task force to evaluate future options for fada i know don shackleford very wellhe is among the best and the brightest in this industry and runs one of ohios most successful s ls while his task force has not yet reached a conclusion lie believes that at some point fada should be completely privatizedand that at the very least the process will take 1 year to complete that certainly is an option that ought to be explored under this bill however as amended by the committee fada could not be sold to the private sector the bottom line is that the home loan bank board wont even have available what could be the least costly option of dissolving fada there is no need for unwise haste in this decision its implications could cost the fslic hundreds of millions of dollars as the cbo stated in its letter of august 4 to the banking committee and i quote the proposal to abolish the federal asset disposition association is likely to create temporary delays in resolving claims from receiverships thus reducing income to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation by perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in 1989 we would not expect this loss of collections to have a budget impact because the fslic would have spent this income rather the agency would have fewer resources to handle case resolutions until an orderly transition to new asset management is in place again i oppose this bill and i will vote against this bill todayand hope that the congress can consider this issue with a greater concern for the health of the fslic the industry and the taxpayer"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "1 yield myself such time as i may consume mr speaker as the sponsor of h r 278 i rise in support of the legislation and wish to commend the

remarkable he has emerged as one of the most hardworking and responsible members of the house appropriations committee as chairman of the hudindependent agencies subcommittee during the last 17 years eddie has been confronted with the most challenging and difficult questions offered by any chairmanship in the congress he must balance national housing priorities with the growing space program ie must balance this nations sacred commitment to its veterans with our commitment to the environment and he must balance community development goals with hazardous waste management at a time of record

were watching the fruits of eddie bolands labor eddie has guided the space program to new highs and he has also provided guidance during the programs most profound lows and while he plans for our

1939 to protect federal workers from partisan political activities the act was adopted in response to actual coercion of federal employees during the franklin roosevelt administration and abuses of the merit system during the 1930s the purpose of the act was to protect government employees from such coercion and abuse in todays society however the hatch act goes too far and simply serves to restrict federal workers unnecessary in exercising their fundamental rights to participate fully and freely in the political process the hatch act is no longer required as the sole guardian against federal employee abuses due to the strength of government employee unions and the press it is difficult to believe that a supervisor who attempts to use his influence to coerce a subordinate to vote a certain way or contribute money to a particular candidate would survive the wrath of that subordinates union or public exposure from the press and it is likely that the political issue or candidate involved also would suffer as a result of the union or press exposure the risk of exposure for the supervisor would be too great and would serve as a strong deterrent to employee coercion or abuse additionally h r 3400 does not strip federal workers of a federal law remedy against coercion and patronage the measure would tighten hatch act prohibitions against such coercion and patronage by simplifying current hatch act language and rulings hatch act restrictions currently are very unclear and complicated federal workers often distance themselves from even permitted political activities out of fear of violating the act rather than serve as a benefit to federal employees the hatch act as presently drafted serves to silence these workers and keep them out of the political process altogether h r 3400 would rectify this situation simply by prohibiting all onthejob political activity while permitting participation in any otherwise legal political activity during the federal employees own time the need for the hatch acts cumbersome and numerous rulings would be eliminated under h r 3400 it is time for congress to recognize the right of the federal work force to fully participate in the political process just as other citizens do and to further recognize that federal workers just as workers in the private sector can deal with partisan pressures without jeopardizing the integrity of their work product i do caution however that the provisions of h r 3400 that would permit a federal worker to take a leave of absence from his job to run for public office go a step beyond granting federal workers the same rights of political freedom as private sector employees place at risk the publics continued confidence in the federal government and must be strenuously monitored as an example consider the federal worker john doe who under the provisions of h r 3400 takes a leave of absence from his job and runs for a local public office assume that mr doe is defeated and as permitted under the bill returns to his federal job further assume that mr doe learns that of the six subordinates who work under him and live in his district only one worked on his campaign if mr doe has the opportunity to promote this subordinate over the others and does based upon the subordinates campaign effort then the federal government would have taken a giant step backward now assume that mr doe has no knowledge of his subordinates campaign contribution but that the public is aware of the subordinates campaign participation and finally that the subordinate is promoted the appearance of bias alone would most likely undermine the publics confidence in that particular government office this perception of wrongdoing must be guarded against with scrupulous rigor my decision on this legislation has been a very difficult one to make i simply am not certain that the majority of active federal workers favors hatch act reform relatively few of my constituents have contacted me to give me their views on h r 3400 although i know of several polls that have been taken on this issue including an informal poll of my own they show neither conclusive support for nor conclusive opposition to reform furthermore i am sensitive to the abuses of federal employees that can follow relaxation of hatch act restrictions and i am particularly sensitive to the fact that coercion can be and most often is subtle a boss need not threaten his subordinate with dismissal or denial of an earned promotion to coerce the subordinate to engage in political activities that further the interests of his superior instead the boss may rely upon unspoken assumptions and innuendo that conformity with the politics of the office is the way to advancement and job security within the organization resulting in subtle pressure on workers to conform to the political philosophy of the office which leads to greater job security i am hopeful that the enforcement provisions of h r 3400 are strong enough and that the merit systems protection board will be diligent enough in carrying out its enforcement duties under the measure to effectively eliminate even subtle pressures to conform to office politics the enforcement mechanisms under h r 3400 must be closely monitored to ensure that coercion and patronage are truly guarded against much of the opposition to h r 3400 stems from the belief that it would repeal the prohibitions against partisan political activity now contained in the hatch act this argument however is simply incorrect and ignores the fact that this legislation would clear up the existing ambiguities in the existing act by eliminating and prohibiting all onthejob political activities instead of continuing the current patch work of regulations which are confusing and often contradictory the bill contains harsher penalties and stronger prohibitions which would act as deterrents against violation of the measure and should encourage and ensure nonpartisan administration of the government which is clearly the desired goal for these reasons i will albeit with some trepidation vote for h r 3400"], [1.0, 1.0, 0,

through the collection of hunting license fees together these funds have helped numerous wildlife species including antelope wood duck whitetailed deer elk black bear and wild turkey the pr program has also assisted in purchasing more than 6 400 square miles of land for wildlife management purposes the program has provided the finances to support hunter education programs which instruct more than 700 000 people each year on firearms safety and outdoor ethics the pr program continues to provide the revenues to assist wildlife research programs to increase our scientific knowledge for

this bill passage of this bill would be a very unwise move particularly at this time and in any event this is not the kind of a bill that should be brought to the house floor with the very limited debate time available under suspension of the rules this bill deserves and merits fullfledged consideration by the house fada was chartered in late 1985 like any new business startup problems were evident salaries were too high and productivity was not as good as expected but let us look at why fada was created it was needed to case the burden on fslic most of the assets that fada has assumed are among the most difficult to sell fadas task was difficult from the start while exorbitant salaries are not justified certainly competitive salaries were needed to attract qualified individuals into this field fada is now under new leadership and its performance has improved dramatically the fact are as follows fada is making a profit now 3 7 million in the first 8 months of 1988 gerald carmen the president of ceo has cut salaries and staff has been reduced from 400 to 356 carmen has consolidated offices which will save over 1 million a year fada provided to the fslic approximately 356 million from property sales loan payoffs asset restructures and settlements in the first none months of 1988 fadas total asset dispositions since receiving its first assets in 1986 now total 935 million and are expected to top 1 billion by tile end of this year with all of this taking place one must wonder what still motivates ihose who want to abolish this agency my position is that we ought to be doing what is best for the fsiic does it really make sense to fold fada within 60 days does it make sense to put 2 500 assets worth 4 billion back into the fslic allowing them to hire only 200 employees to continue fadas job i dont think it is a wise move at this time particularly when this congress is concerned with the progress and pace of shutting down insolvent institutions a constitient of mine don shackleford chairman of ohio state savings bank is now heading a task force to evaluate future options for fada i know don shackleford very wellhe is among the best and the brightest in this industry and runs one of ohios most successful s ls while his task force has not yet reached a conclusion lie believes that at some point fada should be completely privatizedand that at the very least the process will take 1 year to complete that certainly is an option that ought to be explored under this bill however as amended by the committee fada could not be sold to the private sector the bottom line is that the home loan bank board wont even have available what could be the least costly option of dissolving fada there is no need for unwise haste in this decision its implications could cost the fslic hundreds of millions of dollars as the cbo stated in its letter of august 4 to the banking committee and i quote the proposal to abolish the federal asset disposition association is likely to create temporary delays in resolving claims from receiverships thus reducing income to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation by perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in 1989 we would not expect this loss of collections to have a budget impact because the fslic would have spent this income rather the agency would have fewer resources to handle case resolutions until an orderly transition to new asset management is in place again i oppose this bill and i will vote against this bill todayand hope that the congress can consider this issue with a

trustworthy and reasonable man than eddie he has anchored this institution to the fundamental virtues of good government and i am proud to have served with him in the house i am even more proud to have counted him as a good good friend eddies life story is a very familiar one in massachusetts politics hes a first generation americanborn to irish immigrants he w s raised in hungry hill a working class neighborhood in springfield he graduated from boston college he served in the state house and hes a good catholic but eddie didnt fit the mold he helped cast the mold eddies accomplishments here in the congress are remarkable he has emerged as one of the most hardworking and responsible members of the house appropriations committee as chairman of the hudindependent agencies subcommittee during the last 17 years eddie has been confronted with the most challenging and difficult questions offered by any chairmanship in the congress he must balance national housing priorities with the growing space program ie must balance this nations sacred commitment to its veterans with our commitment to the environment and he must balance community development goals with hazardous waste management at a time of record budget deficits eddie has been put in an unenviable position yet his accomplishments are many when millions of americans watched the space shuttle discovery go up last week and land this morning they were watching the fruits of eddie bolands labor eddie has guided the space program to new highs and he has also provided guidance during the programs most profound lows

think of no better honor for eddie a man who prefers that this triumphs appear on the front pages while his name does not eddie has been selfless in his work in the congress last summers irancontra
