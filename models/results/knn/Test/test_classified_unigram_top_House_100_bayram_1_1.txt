negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is that really the deal that the democrats would have us sign on to i

above fiscal year 1987 levels and more than 1 2 billion above the administration request my colleagues will ask why a 300 million cut is the right amount to cut from the interior appropriations bill the response is that a 300 million reduction would reduce by one half the level of increase in appropriations from last year to this year except for the increase in the fillrate of the strategic petroleum reserve last year the congress approved 8 3 billion for the department of interior and related agencies appropriations bill as part of the omnibus continuing resolution this year the committee is recommending a 9 45 billion bill an increase of almost 1 2 billion if one sets aside the decision to provide 600 million in strategic reserve funds this leaves an increase in discretionary spending of approximately 600 million the amendment i am offering would cut this increase in half i believe my amendment is necessary to compensate for the blatantly artificial and unrealistic assumptions made by the budget conference agreement this budget agreement assumes 7 2 billion in revenues from early payment of rea loans my colleagues know that this is not going to happen in todays interest rate market is the rea going to go out and borrow private money to repay subsidized public funds of course not this 7 2 billion savings is no savings at all another

it would take to raise 16 billion in taxes this year i dont think its going to happen finally the conference agreement reconciles only 4 billion of the 30 billion savings requiired for fiscal year

without waiting to see what that agency does assigns the money appropriates the money and spends the money this amendment puts the horse back in front where it belongs and really implements the will

year this years bickering for 3 months after the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require each full year appropriations bill to be passed by congress individually and sent to the president in that form in lieu of separate movement of appropriations bills i have also cosponsored congressman mickey edwards bill h r 3199 that would require separation of any cr into the 13 individual appropriations bills upon presention to the president for signature i would hope that in view of the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many

airborne pollutants upon our environment has become strikingly clear particularly in the northeast the decline of highelevation forests in vermont is well documented as is the acidification of

vermont sportsmen maple producers and outdoorsmen would agree and scientific experts dont either their message is the science does support the bill last august the epa released the preliminary results of its eastern lakes survey which showed startling new signs of damage in the east over 1 000 lakes are dead and over 4 000 lakes have virtually no buffering capacity left to neutralize acid rain the presitigious national academy of sciences has found a direct link between sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain damage in a march 1986 report the nas concluded that a casual relationship exists between so2 emissions and acidification of lakes in the admirondacks research conducted by the unitedstates forest service made public at a senate envionment and public works committee hearing last december turned up alarming declines in growth through the southeastern united states in yellow pines an important commercial species the regional survey of southern pine stands found growth reductions of 40 to 50 percent over the last 20 years this study is significant for two critically important reasons first it illustrates that acid rain is not exclusively a northeastern problem florida lakes and southern appalachian forest are dying while fragile alpine environments in the west are also threatened second this study is especially significant because it illustrates the economic costs of not acting to reduce acid rain opponents of the bill complain loudly about the cost of reducing emissions but they ignore the costs of inaction forest decline could have a devastating economic impact on the forest products industry in the east in addition a draft study prepared by epa brookhaven national laboratory and the army corps of engineers estimated that materials damage to statues monuments and historical buildings may be as high as 6 billion per year if congress weighs the costs of action against the costs of inaction i am confident that congress will move expeditiously and favorably on this legislation after 4 years and a number of approaches we have finally developed an acid rain bill which can pass the house of representatives h r 4567 as approved by the health and environment subcommittee will mandate the emissions reductions necessary to curb acid rain and it will give the states maximum flexibility in achieving these emissions reductions this bill has several advantages the first is flexibility the bill mandates tough new statewide average emissions standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the governor of each state will have the flexibility to choose from a wide array of options to meet this statewide emissions standard the bill does not mandate scrubbers in many states switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur coal will be sufficient to meet the emissions standard by providing this flexibility h r 4567 will promote leastcost methods of meeting emissions standards and saving ratepayers millions of dollars the flexibility of h r 4567 also allows governors concerned about the loss of highsulfur coal jobs to preserve these jobs the second criterion is ratepayer protection the bill would create a pollution control trust fund with a small fee on fossil fuel power produced in or imported into the untied states this trust fund would be used to cap residential rate increases attributable to the bill to no more than 10 percent this fee would increase the average residential customers monthly rate by an average of only 25 to 50 cents per month the inclusion of this provision in the bill illustrates the willingness of the sponsors to reduce to the extent possible the regional inequity in rate impacts the third and most important criterion large and meaningful reductions recent scientific evidence suggests that reductions of sulfur dioxide alone is not enough to ensure the future protection of our forests lakes and streams in addition to a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide our bill requires a 4millionton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions nitrogen oxide is a precursor of ozone which has been linked to forest decline and crop damage in numerous studies nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by tightening emissions standards on cars and trucks the tough emissions reductions contained in h r 4567 will insure that our forests lakes and streams do not meet a fate similar to those in europe this is the year for acid rain legislation this approach has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the new england governors conference it has also been strongly endorsed

his way through the maze that so often attends legislative research and produced a full response that was precisely what the client ordered bernie also had an uncanny way of sensing what clients

house to the president of the united states urging him to begin negotiations with the soviet union relative to its presence in nicaragua it is a most fascinating letter signed on to by a large portion of the democratic leadership including the people who brought the bill to the floor the othl day that had provisions in it whiei would have committed our military to central america and to the nicaraguan problem for the first time but in this letter to the president they say some very fascinating things that i think the american people should reflect upon for example in this letter they are saying quite clearly that the nicaraguan communist government represents a real threat to unitedstates security they say at present the greatest danger of such a threatmeaning to central america in this case and they above say that the united states has valid security concerns in central america and then they say at present the greatest danger of such a threat is in nicaragua under the government of the sandinista junta then they go on to say some very interesting things for instance they make the point about the massive amount of soviet aid that is there including as they put it mi24 hind attack helicopters and then they make this statement there are also rumors of the construction of submarine bases and airfields capable of landing the largest bombers we know that that is more than rumor unless of course pictures of those bases are simply rumor because on this floor during the debate my colleague the gentleman from california actually showed this house pictures of the airfields pictures of the submarine bases it is more than rumor it is fact that is the problem that we are faced with anyhow they go on and they suggest to the president that what he ought to do is to negotiate the soviet presence out of nicaragua the problem with this letter is that it does not seem to recognize that those negotiations have already been under way and that the soviet union is not responding in a manner which helps our security interests i have here another letter this one from colin powell the national security adviser to the president who has pointqd out to us he wrote it to one of our colleagues the chairman of the subcommittee on europe and the middle east and he says in the letter president reagan raised the issue of nicaragua with the general secretary pointing out that continuing massive soviet supply of military equipment to the sandinista regime aggravates the situation in central america and constitutes another instance in which soviet actions in regional conflicts made unitedstates soviet relations more difficult secretary schultz pursued the same topic with the soviets in postsummit consultations in other words what this letter says is that there is an ongoing process of discussions taking place on the very topic that the democrats are saying open negotiations about i am surprised that they do not know what is really going on but let us go on in the letter because this is the problem mr powell goes on and points out the soviet position on the question is clear they propose to limit military assistance to the sandinistas to only small armswhich the general secretary characterized as police arms in exchange for unitedstates stopping its military assistance programs to the other nations of central america and to the nicaraguan democratic resistance this proposal needless to say is not congruent with our commitments to the central american democracies nor with our national interest its acceptance would leave the present dangerous sandinista military preponderance over its neighbors entirely intact moreover it would have us legitimize a dangerous extension of soviet power onto the mainland of the western hemisphere now the only thing that i can conclude is either the people who signed on to this letter are totally ignorant of the negotiations that are ongoing or they intend for us to accept the soviet proposal because i can come to no other interpretation of what they are saying to the president if in fact what they are saying is mr president accept what the soviets offer let us understand what that means it means the soviets would continue to send the small arms in ak47s for instance automatic rifles while we would send no aid whatsoever to the central american democracies what that would mean is that the guerrilla forces that have been funded and have been supported out of nicaragua would be able to get those ak47s to use against el salvador to use against guatemala to use against honduras to use against costa rica and those countries would not have any help to respond the soviets are saying let us send small arms we wont send tanks but we are going to send small arms but you send nothing is

said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit

defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase

to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong

it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many

black from bluefield who supported the sandinista government the communist sandinista government when they took power he worked with them because he thought they were going to bring about democracy in that country well after he found out what they were really all about he started opposing some of their policies they put him in a gulagstyle jail a very small one they pulled his fingernails out one by one he showed me what they had done to him i took him to meet jesse jackson i said i want you to talk to this guy because you think daniel ortega is the george washington of this country in fact i heard him say that i heard him make a statement to that effect at least i recall he made a statement to that effect i think it was published in time or newsweek and he looked at this man and talked to this man the man showed him his fingers talked about the atrocities burning people alive to death he talked about these little villages down there the repression of the miskito indians and so forth and jesse jackson looked at him and said well those kinds of atrocities unfortunately take place in any way that is the price of war but fortunately when this thing is all over they will head toward democracy in nicaragua i believe and hope and pray that jesses jackson reverend jackson has been duped by daniel ortega fidel castro and others but the fact of the matter is he at least has been gullible enough to believe those people i think we ought to think long and hard about that as we debate the issues in this presidential campaign because he is becoming more and more of a strong political figure people ought to know his foreign policy views clearly"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "and others for a strong acid rain title in the 1980 omnibus energy act in the past decade the impact of these airborne pollutants upon our environment has become strikingly clear particularly in the northeast the decline of highelevation forests in vermont is well documented as is the acidification of hundreds of lakes throughout the northeast most recently sugar maple trees in vermont have been dying at an alarming rate acid rain is threatening to turn vermontthe green mountain state and the home of maple syrupinto the brown mountain state with sour syrup dead lakes and stunted trees despite the abundance of evidence vermonters are repeatedly told that more study is necessary but i dont think vermont sportsmen maple producers and outdoorsmen would agree and scientific experts dont either their message is the science does support the bill last august the epa released the preliminary results of its eastern lakes survey which showed startling new signs of damage in the east over 1 000 lakes are dead and over 4 000 lakes have virtually no buffering capacity left to neutralize acid rain the presitigious national academy of sciences has found a direct link between sulfur dioxide emissions and acid rain damage in a march 1986 report the nas concluded that a casual relationship exists between so2 emissions and acidification of lakes in the admirondacks research conducted by the unitedstates forest service made public at a senate envionment and public works committee hearing last december turned up alarming declines in growth through the southeastern united states in yellow pines an important commercial species the regional survey of southern pine stands found growth reductions of 40 to 50 percent over the last 20 years this study is significant for two critically important reasons first it illustrates that acid rain is not exclusively a northeastern problem florida lakes and southern appalachian forest are dying while fragile alpine environments in the west are also threatened second this study is especially significant because it illustrates the economic costs of not acting to reduce acid rain opponents of the bill complain loudly about the cost of reducing emissions but they ignore the costs of inaction forest decline could have a devastating economic impact on the forest products industry in the east in addition a draft study prepared by epa brookhaven national laboratory and the army corps of engineers estimated that materials damage to statues monuments and historical buildings may be as high as 6 billion per year if congress weighs the costs of action against the costs of inaction i am confident that congress will move expeditiously and favorably on this legislation after 4 years and a number of approaches we have finally developed an acid rain bill which can pass the house of representatives h r 4567 as approved by the health and environment subcommittee will mandate the emissions reductions necessary to curb acid rain and it will give the states maximum flexibility in achieving these emissions reductions this bill has several advantages the first is flexibility the bill mandates tough new statewide average emissions standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the governor of each state will have the flexibility to choose from a wide array of options to meet this statewide emissions standard the bill does not mandate scrubbers in many states switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur coal will be sufficient to meet the emissions standard by providing this flexibility h r 4567 will promote leastcost methods of meeting emissions standards and saving ratepayers millions of dollars the flexibility of h r 4567 also allows governors concerned about the loss of highsulfur coal jobs to preserve these jobs the second criterion is ratepayer protection the bill would create a pollution control trust fund with a small fee on fossil fuel power produced in or imported into the untied states this trust fund would be used to cap residential rate increases attributable to the bill to no more than 10 percent this fee would increase the average residential customers monthly rate by an average of only 25 to 50 cents per month the inclusion of this provision in the bill illustrates the willingness of the sponsors to reduce to the extent possible the regional inequity in rate impacts the third and most important criterion large and meaningful reductions recent scientific evidence suggests that reductions of sulfur dioxide alone is not enough to ensure the future protection of our forests lakes and streams in addition to a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide our bill requires a 4millionton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions nitrogen oxide is a precursor of ozone which has been linked to forest decline and crop damage in numerous studies nitrogen oxide emissions will be reduced by tightening emissions standards on cars and trucks the tough emissions reductions contained in h r 4567 will insure that our forests lakes and streams do not meet a fate similar to those in europe this is the year for acid rain legislation this approach has been endorsed by a wide range of groups including the new england governors conference it has also been strongly endorsed by the league of women voters the league of conservation voters the sierra club the national audubon society the national clean air coalition and numerous other groups i urge all members to join this bipartisan effort by supporting my amendment"]]}
