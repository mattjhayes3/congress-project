nearly a 100vote margin to increase the funding for the environmental protection agencys research program to last years appropriations level at that time it was made clear that such an increase was

month ago to the epa budget and environmental protection we must vote today to bring the appropriations for epas research closer to the fiscal year 1982 appropriations level when we debated this issue previously i think we made obvious a contradiction in epa research policy on the one hand the agency is committed to improving the quality of scientific research that it uses to support our environmental standards that is a goal that all of us can enthusiastically endorse at the same time however the agency is cutting exactly those longterm research projects that keep the epa in the forefront of environmental science the point is obvious if the agency is going to focus its entire environmental program on shortterm regulatory needs the quality of its science will inevitably deteriorate that point has been underscored by the american chemical society which represents 125 000 chemists and engineers and which has enthusiastically endorsed the amendment to restore appropriations for epa research let me quote directly from the societys letter the scheuer amendment would increase funding for extramural research an area slated for drastic cuts by administration thereby allowing the agency to draw upon qualified creative experts outside epa who can assist in solving environmental problems the extramural program is critical because it is open to the entire scientific community including many of the best environmental scientists some of whom have become discouraged by their inability to have their work supported by funding through the epa laboratories the proposed additional funds will allow epa to increase its longrange research on emerging environmental problems it would be shortsighted to wait until such problems reach crisis proportions before

ago i had the privilege of being admitted to the bar of the state of north carolina it was a particular privilege for me because my own father swore me in and that day when he permitted me to come within the bar of that curt he granted me a great privilege but concomitant with that privilege he also granted me a lot or responsibility the issue today is not whether poor people are entitled to legal services the issue today is whose responsibility is it to provide them for 15 years the congress of the united states has been trying to give people rights and take away their responsibilities the issue today is whether or not the legal business is a profession or a trade whether or not members of the bar have an obligation to do pro bono work one of the greatest deans of aiy law school ever in this country was dean carroll weathers and he spent many months in our senior year at wake forest law school instilling in us the history of the legal profession since the days of the greek citystates how advocacy was originally not something one pursued for gain or profit because ark advocate was not paid he was granted an honorarium but our legal profession wants to get rid of its responsibilities to the poor and have the american taxpayer assume those responsibilities because it is beneath the dignity or not in the economic interests of the wealthy wall street lawyers to take their time pursuing the interests of the poor and the indigent well actually we are doing the organized bar a great disservice by taking this responsibility away from them because once we do it then they become merely purveyors of their minds and their souls at the highest hourly rate because they have no responsibility that enures to their professlon somehow or another i do not think we will have done them a favor in the long run by taking away this responsibility we wm have denied them something special something that comes with being a professional i do not think any doctor in this country would deny a person needing an operation this operation because he could not pay for it if so they do not warrant the recognition that the hippocratic oath grants them but one thing is for sure if the legal profession does not pick up and assume the responsibilities to the poor the indigent it should not be the burden of the taxpayers of the united states to take up their responsibilities if we take it over they will never regain it and what was once a great and noble profession will degenerate into a mere craft"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "60 years ago on this date the us government officially recognized the three baltic republics of estonia lithuania and latvia these baltic states had been independent for approximately 4 years and the united states felt in 1922 that it was time to welcome estonia lithuania and latvia into the international arena from that moment in 1922 these new nations achieved even greater legitimacy and established a firm basis for their right to exist these small countries when grouped together occupy about the same amount of territory as new england yet they have given the world much through their culture and knowledge and will continue to do so in the future when the baltic states first became independent they were constantly under pressure from their two powerful and aggressive neighbors germany and russia estonia lithuania and latvia were the object of many political quarrels between the two huge countries nearby who fought over the natural resources available in the area eventually as everyone here tonight knows the russians entered the baltic states and took control of the governments at that time the many balts who protested were arrested sent out ot the country or killed here in the united states it is difficult to realize how hard the struggle for freedom has been for the baltic people but we cannot forget that not long ago we americans were oppressed by colonial overlords however with some assistance from friendly nations we carried through a revolution and established our freedom as the united states of america thus it is incumbent on us to vocally support those people whose nations have been forcibly invaded and occupied the inhumane actions of the soviet union cannot be legitimized simply by waiting for the nations of the west to forget all about the baltic states for that reason we have introduced a resolution in the house house resolution 526 which reaffirms the unitedstates recognition of the baltic states in 1922 fortyfour members of the house have cosponsored this resolution and i am confident that many more will do so in the near future when this measure is passed by the house of representatives it will send a strong signal to the soviet union that we have not forgotten the plight of the baltic nations i would like to enter the text of the resolution into the record"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "63 years ago today the people of latvia proudly announced to the world their existence as a free and independent nation in doing so they exercised one of the most basic of human rights the right to an identity as a people their freedom however lasted barely over two decades what happened to them is the history of all nonrussian states within the unitedstatess r a history of brutal expansionism and tyranical oppression in 1940 the soviet union forcibly and unlawfully incorporated latvia within its domain and set out systematically to destroy the countrys national cultural linguistic and religious integrity to accomplish this they practiced every tactic of terrorism imprisonment exile torture and murder it is out of outrage for this barbarous injustice that the united states along with other great western powers steadfastly maintains a policy of nonrecognition of the forcible annexation of latvia a national independence day is supposed to be a time of celebration so what do we have to celebrate latvia is still a captive nation the baltic freedom fighters who for years waged guerrilla warfare in the face of impossible odds have finally been crushed all dissident activities have been driven underground and the people of latvia are daily denied the elemental rights of human beings so what do we have to celebrate we have the fact that despite unrelenting oppression the latvians fierce love of liberty and commitment to national identity has not diminished by one jot their experience should remind us how privileged we are to live in the free world and should spur us to help people everywhere who are struggling against persecution i am honored therefore to join with latvians around the world in celebrating their independence day and i join them too in working and praying for the day when latvia will once again be free in fact as

into the desert any time one nation sets out to destroy another nation or people a great crime against humanity is committed if we do not express our outrage against this crime it will be committed
