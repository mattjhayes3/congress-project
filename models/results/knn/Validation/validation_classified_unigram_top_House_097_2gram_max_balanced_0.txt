{"top_correct": [[0.0, 0.0, 0, "1 would like to change the focus of debate on this budget resolution thus far from one of emphasis on the cut in spending to one of emphasis on cutting taxes i really believe that the votes we are going to cast next tuesday and wednesday on the various substitutes to the budget resolution may well be the most important votes we will cast in this congress i would like to explain why this first budget resolution sets these aggregate target levels for spending and for revenues although technically they my well not be binding lthe point ils the committee on ways and means on which i serve is not going to cut taxes any less than or any more than is allowed by this budget resolution and most certainly not any more than this level therefore if we adopt a budget resolution that does not allow any cut in taxes there will not be any or if we adopt a budget resolution like the budget committee has put forward that allows less of a tax cut then we are seeking in the orammlatta substitute then we are going to be bound by those terms as well so as a practical matter the committee on ways and means is not going to send a tax cut bill to the floor that cuts taxes any more than this first budget resolution will allow as a theoretical matter tha~t is really the way it ought to be i agree with the chairman of the budget committee in this regard if the budget process means anything this first budget resolution ought to mean something in the past in the four terms i have been in thishouse i have seen time and time again passage of budget resolutions without their meaning anything nobody paid any attention whatsoever to those figures we really ought to if the budget process is going to mean anything as a practical matter we will as far as the committee on ways and means is concenied therefore this is why i say these votes on substitutes and the resolution next tuesday and wednesday are really going to be the most important votes we cast in this congress the most important issue facing this congress is that of the economy the most important votes we are going to have occur on whether or not we are going to implemhent a program the president of the united states has presented to the congress for economic recovery therefore if we wing or injure or handicap or cripple what we are going to be able to subsequently do in the area of tax cuts in part~icular by this budget resolution then we are in effecting winging or handicapping this economic program one of the four parts of the economic recovery program of the president is a sound tax cut program l this tax cut programs life depends upon this budget resolution we are going to adopt basically if we look at what we are hearing in the committee on ways and means i agree wholeheartily with the president of thie united states that we must have a responsible and substantive tax cut program to help solve our economic problems one of the real problems we are having today is that of productivity last year the productivity of the united states was almost dead last when compared to other major industrial nations and for the first time in recent history productivity in this country did not go up it actually declined in 1980 when you have declining productivity your efficiency is going down the ability to produce goods and services is going down in terms of competition with foreign count~ries and in terms of any kind of real growth in this country which means inflation as it costs more to produce something that is inflation as you produce less of something in comparison to foreign competition that is inflation an ople work less hard because there is no incentive because you are not taking home any more money because of high tax rates that is inflation so basically what we believe land strongly believe is that the only real way we can address this problem of productivity is to cut taxes in a meaningful way to cut taxes to make it possible to improve productivity now we do that in this fashion the reason we have to cut these taxes is to mak~e capital available i think everybody understands that the way you retool or modernize a factory the way you have a plant expand and the way to create jobs and the way you are able to keep up with japanese competition in steel and automobiles is to spend money or capital on these factories and these plants where does this capital come from you cannot expect businesses and individuals today to borrow money not at 15 percent and the prime rate continuing to climb as a matter of fact the amount of money american business is borrowing is unhealthy they ought to be generating that capital in aftertax income we oughtto be encouraging individuals to invest money and this is not true under the current tax situation we have in this country so basically if we cut tax rates we generate capital rm aing with the individual who can tnivest money received in a tax cut and put it back i the depository institutions in this country where we need it to lower interest rates we let business have additional profits after their taxes as they will be able to plow capital back into their businesses to retool and modernize there is a new wrinkle we ought to think about too as we reduce the individual tax burden we are letting the taxpayer see he has more after tax income than before and just maybe he will work a little bit harder how many people do we know now who take off a full days work because they are paying too much in taxes in my part of the country a lot of folks will take off for deer hunting season and not work for a month or two because it costs too much to werk they can make almost as much on food stamps and unemployment compensation as they can working and paying taxes as long as we h ave that kind of situation existing in this country we are going to have iflation and low productivity we have to make it possible for people to make more money and keep more of what they earn the same thing is true of the business community to be able to invest that capital to be able to retool modernize our industrial base to keep up with the japanese and germans and to also be able to have people see it pays more to work than it does to play so we have to have capital to solve our problems of productivity and productivity is one of the biggest solutions to our problem of inflation in the year 1980 according to an artide i read the other day in my home town newspaper taxes on a family making about 30 000 a year a family of four went up 25 percent by virtue of their federal tax burdensin 1 year 25 percent in 1965 only 7 percent of all of our taxpayers paid the marginal tax rate of more than 25 percent by 1977 that figure had grown from 7 percent to 30 percent of the american people who were paying more than this because of bracket creep and because of tax increase~s these dual perils are continuing to push more and miore of our taxpayers into higher tax brackets with no more real income to spend by virtue of inflation and these tax increases individuals need a tax break in this country they need it to be able to work harder they need it to be able to make ends meet and they need it out of a spirit of fairness but what i am contending goes beyond that we must have these tax cuts to actually make it possible for our economy to grow and to expand and to hire more people and take care of the people in this country who are less fortunate and have no opportuni ties as the gentleman spoke so eloquently about a mioment ago now if we look at what we have to vote on next tuesday and wednesd~ay in light of the need for tax cuts this might color our final decision first of all we have the substitute by the gentleman from the district of columbia"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "15 months ago we inaugurated a new presidenta new president who brought a vigorous new approach to the solutions of the problems confronting this nation and the world by their votes the people of this nation indicated they wanted a change in direction and this president offered a change he promised to try and reduce federal spending he promised to try to cut the destructive high inflation rate he promised to reduce the unwarranted and unnecessary federal interference in our daily lives with the help in some cases reluctant help of the 535 members of congress this president has made a new beginning he was not able to reduce federal spending but he did cut my more than half the request for increased federal spending he was not able to eliminate all the unnecessary redtape but he was able to reduce the number of pages of regulations printed in the federal register from 73 000 to 51 000 he was not able to end inflation but he did cut the rate which had been in double digit figures for most of the previous administration down to an annualized rate in the month of march of less than 4 percent for the past 5 or 6 months we have been provided with a consistent diet of bad news the morning newspaper headlines and the evening television news emphasize what they perceive to be wrong with the presidents program and ignore what many common folk perceive to be right with the presidents program nowhere has this consistent criticism of the reagan administration been more pernicious than it has been in the reports of central and latin america and particularly the reports from el salvador now i call your attention to some good news and to underscore the importance of this good news permit me to review in some detail what has been going on in el salvador mr speaker in land area this nation is about the size of your own state of massachusetts it is bordered by guatemala on the north honduras on the east and nicaragua on the southeast with about 135 miles of frontage on the pacific ocean about 5 million people live in el salvador el salvador became independent of spain in 1821 and of the central american federation in 1841 about 10 percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and different attitude toward the role of the federal government in our everyday lives is a remarkable change we spent billions to create the great society and are we better off for all that public money spent the crime rate in evcry category is up we spent billions of public money in the

august 23 1939 offered to nazi germany a welcome pretense for starting world war ii and allowed parts of eastern europe including the three baltic nationsestonia latvia and lithuaniato become part of soviet russias socalled sphere of influence consequently stalin received a free hand to forcibly annex these three independent baltic countries which remain illegally occupied by the unitedstatess r

soviet union during the period of 20 years which the estonian people enjoyed their independence they demonstrated what a small nation is able to achieve in all fields while enjoying a democratic way of life they achieved an exceptionally high educational level the history of estonian literature was documented by the publication of the first book in the estonian language in 1935 the estonian people may also be particularly proud of their agricultural accomplishments and impressive industrial achievements during this time their folklore continues to win recognition for its originality colorful variety and great artistic value as a result of the soviet invasion in 1940 this prosperous life came to an abrupt end by the brutal acts of their large totalitarian neighbor since then the estonian people have suffered extremely heavy human and material losses this situation still persists estonia is economically exploited by the moscow legime those who dare make any requests for

same perspective prevailed also in 1956 when the cardinals guidance in a large way prevented a russian invasion which afflicted hungary that same year central to his philosophy were powerful and i think correct views of mans relationship to god and state he felt strongly that man ought to be in the service of god but not a slave of the state the right of people to selfdetermine their own destiny was perhaps his most closely held political conviction his revulsion at the soviet imposition of a communist government on the people of poland was only equaled by his revulsion at the possibility of yet another soviet violation of polands national integrity the cardinal was regarded as a living reminder of his homelands ageold quest for freedom and independence his death impedes this quest but the memory of him insures its ultimate success e"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "with a repertoire that ranges from i love you california to strauss compositions the 75 member baptist voice childrens

bill would mean to afice 250 million in budget authority our ability to protect our national security interests in the middle east persian gulf region the willingness of other nations in the region to support camfp david will be greatly influenced by perceptions of americas commitment to assist our friends in the region in the aftermath of sadats assassination the government of egypt is and will continue to be under increasing pressure to pull away from the camp david process our continued support of mubarak is essential to countering such pressures under the level of funding that would be provided under a continuing resolution it would be impossibld to meet our security assistance obligations to israel and egypt and still provide essential assistance to other key states in the region and elsewhere throughout the world the threat posed by libya alone adds additional burdens to our security assistance efforts in the region and further endangers camp david the rise of libyan military power has been stunning libya is moscows biggest third world client in arms traffic qadhafi is reported to have bought 12 billion worth of soviet arms in the last few years more than could conceivably be used by the libyans alone at present 10 000 of libyas 45 000 soviettrained troops are deployed along chads eastern border with the sudan there have been repeated coup attempts against sudanese president jaafar nimeri which sudan has attributed to libyan instigation khartoum reported having uncovered a libyan organized secret undergound army the details of which emerged just one week before sadat was assassinated under the level of funding available in the continuing resolution we would be unable to provide the concessional fms credits that are required in the sudan or to meet the economic support moneys promised nimeri to help him combat economic instability that qadhaf i seeks to exploit the prospects for peace embodied in camp david cannot flourish in an area when its friends such as nimeri are left vulnerable to aggression and subversion moreover our failure to meet security assistance targets in this critical region would seriously impair the ability of our fledgling rapid deployment force to be able to accomplish its mission secure military access requires immediate access to ports airfields and other reception facilities and sustained access to logistical support bases neither is currently available to the rdf in the gulf some military facilities are needed to support routine operations in peacetime mombasa kenya is the only indian ocean port where unitedstates combat ships can have minor repairs performed and where crews can be given liberty the airfield at masirali island adcembera1 1981 decemnber 10 1981 oman is the base for routine patrol flights over the indian ocean forces flying from the united states 0o the unitedstates facilities in the gulf region need fuel en route laejes airfield in the azores is the only such refueling facility available the egyptian base at r ~ banas is designed to serve as a rear area base and is also a potential base for heavy bombers oman is in a position to provide a facility on masirah island to serve as a combat air base at the mouth of the persian gulf other important omani facilities include the airfield at seeb and a small naval base near the strait of hormuz finally the port and airfield at berbera somalia and the bases at kenya are essential to ocean patrol each of these countrieskenya oman portugal egypt somaliais a planned recipient of substantial security assistance moneys from this country if it becomes necessary to divert funds from some of these countries or other strategically located countries such as djibouti or north yemen in order to meet first priority commitments then we may find their governments less than enthusiastic in granting the united states continued access to bases and facilities vital to our ability to pirotect our interests in the middle east or persian gulf areas finally no discussion of our security interests in this region would be complete witlaout addressing the pressing security needs of our nato ally turkey as the chairman of the jcs recently testified the russian forces in the transcaucasus are being upgraded and right now are more combatready than they were just before the russian invasion of afghanistan moreover the russian divisionsnumbering 26are capable of marching from the transcaucasus and afghanistan in a major move which would be aimed to take over the persian gulf region turkey alone has the forces and the proximity ready to meet this threat in addition to turkeys longstanding role as the western bulwark in defense of natos southern flank the size of turkeys armed forces is second only to the united states in the alliance yet its military equipment is obsolete as a result of the american arms embargo from 197478 and the lower priority accorded to the southern flank relative to central europe at the same time the turkish economy is seriously weak that is why turkey is scheduled to receive 425 million in esf and fms assistance it is clear thatthis level of funding could not be maintained under the continuing resolution without adversely impacting upon important security assistance efforts in other countries in short if we end up under a cra in fiscal year 1982 our security assistance requirements in southwest asis simply could not be met the prospects of continuing suqcess under camp david would grow dim indeed 1overall the vms credits available for the countries other than egypt and israel would be reduced from the original request of 1 754 4 million to 746 2 milliona reduction of almost 43 percent in europe this could mean that we have as little as 300 million to cover country programs which in fiscal year 1981 received 600 million it would effectively destroy any chance of moving forward witfi our caribbean basin initiative in east asia we could have as little as 150 million for the entire region 50 million of which would be required to meet our commitment to the philippines this would leave only 100 million to cover programs for korea thailand indonesia and malaysia which received 250 million in fiscal year 1981 and finally if we are able to meet just the barest of our commitments by which i mean honoring earmarkings in current law and honoring specif ic international commitnients under the cr we would be short 50 million in esf funds and we would be short nearly 400 million in fms credits and in the process we would be forced to abandon many many countries that look to the united states for invaluable security and economic support funds such as liberia zambia thailand lebanon and jamaica and far too many others each of which is important to the united states and~ our ability to protect our interests in many parts of the world in 1947 harry truman launched the beginning of the unitedstates security assistance efforts the truman doctrine pledged that the united states would support free people who are resisting attempted subjugations by armed minorities or by outside pressure 11 specifically addressed then to soviet pressure on greece and turkey this pledge has come to underlie much of our security and economic assistance programs today w but as americans we midght remember back to an earlier time when our country was struggling to be free the first instructions given to our representative to paris one benjamin franklin read l i you will solicit the court of france for an immediate supply of twenty or thirty thousand muskets and bayonets and a large supply of ammunition and brass field pieces fortunately mr franklins ministry was successful the french agreed to help today we need the help and cooperation of other countries to make our defense posture workable to carry out our foreign policy goals and to preserve both peace and a world environment in which nations canfreely choose to live by the principles and values which mean so much to us in looking at a map of the globe i wonder which countries scheduled to receive unitedstates security assistance can we afford to leave vulnerable to forces promoting instability and disrujption for that is that choice that would have to be made if this bill is not passed and in the long run it would be the security of this nation and our ability to protect our vital interests that would be impaired just as our foreign policy must provide for assisting our allies in defend ing themselves from military aggression it must be designed to assist them in building and maintaining strong economies in announcing the truman doctrine president harry truman said the sceds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want they spread and grow in the evil and soil of poverty and strife they reach their full growth whbn thehope of a people for a better life has died we must keep hope ailve i think that all americans share this great presidents view that democracy depends on maintaining the hope of people that the human condition will improve only when hope is dead are people willing to surrender control of their lives to totalitarian forces but while we recognize this to be the case we have been negligent in promoting our ownsystern of democratic freeentetprise as the model for eco nomic progress we have failed to tell those who look to us for leadership that it is the energy and initiative of their own people which are their greatest assets and the keys to economic progress to a large degree our hesitancy has evolved from our own failedexperiment with demand management economics and the inentive destroying policies which are only this year being reversed ronald c nairn cites this as a major factor in the decline of western leadership he wrote in his wealth of nations in crisis we must abandon the despair of the past two decades axid the seeming acceptance of a fixed future either immutable or where material wherewithal declines we must accept the future as an open and malleable by the mind and hand of man accepting the role of economic leader in the west we must first get our own house in order nairn quotes the buddhas question how can one man stuck in the mud pull out another man stuck in the mud this is the dilemma in which we have found ourselves in his recent talks with the heads of developing nations president reagan has made clear to them the single most important action which the unite d states cani take to assist with the economic problems of the less developed nations is to restore economic growth and prosperity to our domestic economy in the absence of this rbsto ration the massive trade on which the economies of the ldcs depend cannot be increased morteover once we have again proved the success of the american path of development we can export the ameican idea of demoii 9292 cratic free enterprise abroad it is velopment this assistance whether right and it works

that stage of the iye to growth and prosperity at the debate i want to lay before my colsame time the president has aired leagues my ideas on the proper role of concerns over the operation of these

economic policy of that nation there of the united states to provide this as is no capital shortage in a nation sistance hich encourages enterprise and the thirdlarea of foreign economic allows labor and capital to retain the assistance is funding for economic de fruits of work and entrepreneurship the tremendous success of the small individual plots of land cultivated in the soviet union and china are the supreme statement of the abilities of people to accumulate capital and produce for the marketplace however adverse the conditions may be the great shame which we as americans must face in tlls regard is that we have been the most successful pro ponents of restricting economic liberty we have spent 30 years advising other nations to tax and spend to control and direct investment run deficits devalue currencies limit imports and push exports our ideas have been followed confiscatory tax policies state control of productive resources and initiative destroying economic planning are fixtures of economic policy the result is shattered economies throughout the developing world once these destructive domestic economic policies are in place a capital shortage inevitably follows advocates of massive capital transfers invoke a variety of jutifications for the shortfall and for the proposed cure the first argument is that the domestic economy is incapable due to the level of income of generating a level of savings which can support the required per capita capital base the key issue here is that there is no standard of required capital viewed from the industrialized nations it is easy to determine that general motors cannot be recreated in an ldc unfortunately it has not been easy to determine that every ldc does not require steel mills heavy manufacturing and massive transportation infrastructure the assumption is madi by advocates of capital transfer that wealth and income will be increased by transferring capital from an area where it is relatively plentiful to one in which it is relatively scarce ignored are the reasons for the original distribution opportunity and reward transferring capital to economies which the market has determined are less efficient users of capital results in a reduction of incomes and wealth worldwide when the various development assistance agencies evaluate projects they use the concept of economic rate of return this differs from a financial rate of return by including subjective measures of social progress and a politically determined discount rate for determining the preference for current and future consumption in this way projects which have a financial rate of return of 3 percent are provided with capital from western economies which would have earned a 20 percent financial return the investments are regarded as equivalent by ida what is lost in this transfer of wealth over 20 years the income flowing from the investment in the ldc is 23 times smaller than the investment in the west what this means is that by giving the money to the ldc to invest in the west the incomes of those in direct poverty could be increased greatly a second justification for major capital transfers and one which is increasingly being made is that ldos have developed tremendous difficulties with their balance of payments transfer proponents argue that it is necessary for future development for the west to provide interim funding to cover these deficits the facts suggest a different course most balance of payments difficul ties arise because of inability to repay prior loan commitments ldca currently hold 400 billion in loans from the developed nations during 1980 approximately 91 billion in repayments were due on loans from private and official sources the much publicized difficulties in brazil and the recent loan of 5 8 billion to india by the imp are indicative of the level of financial stress in which many ldcs find themselves why this tremendous debt with no ability to repay the concessional loans made to ldcs with their high economic rather than financial rates of return quite simply do not generate sufficient returns to pay interest much less to repay capital moreover there is increasing evidence particularly from poland that western banks have been profligate in loans to foreign governments failing to apply the strict financial criteria whichthey use for western borrowers thus the projects funded from both private afid official sources are yielding returns which are inadequate for repayment ilot to be left out of a discussion of balance of payments problems is oil it is asserted that the west must assist ldcs in paying their energy bills this is a most curious argument put simzoly it goes like this opec a collection of ldcs raises oil prices to its fellow ides the energy bill is paid by private dnd official capital transfers from the west in that savings are depleted in the ldcs balance of payments difficulties result from repayment of these loans which again are to be redressed by additional transfers the cycle of payments may be endless the effcts or orrc~ capta txs there are four basic effects of capital transfers made through official channels whether goverrnent tgovernment or through the multiltral institutions first the individual ide meaned relative to the state as cotroller of capital the state becoes the primary economic agent nobel laureate theodore w schultz put th problem succinctly in writing of th plight of ldc farmers mufam people in lowincome countries have virtually no direct contact with lthe interna tional donor

resources has as its most damaging byproduct the destructiton of economic moreover as political considerations skills and initiative in an economy replace economic discipline distorwhere distribution of resources is tions appear in the marketplace the made on political rationale it is the politically more active urban areas political mind that is developed rather press for price controls on agricultural than the economic basic instinctsfor production which rapidly lead to reachievement of economic wellbeing duced food supplies 4nd calls for food are disregarded as individuals vie for assistance political decisions also tend political favor while our own econo to favor domestic investors and firms my is not innocent in this regardwit at the expense of potential foreign inness the chrysler loan guarantee and vestors trade and investment barriers the exportimport bankthe damage are raised to protect the politically has reached crippling levels in the powerful which further restrict output ldcs and income a second major effect of official cap the economic loss from these disital transfers is that the levels and tortions affects all economies total nature of the projects undertaken are wealth and income are reduced by in devised administered and evaluated efficient project choice gains to trade by bureaucracies far removed both are substantially eliminated human from the economic conditions of the capital development is retarded robrecipient nations and from the disci bing individuals of thle most cherished pline of those whose capital is being form of wealth these distortions in transferred the economic inefficiency more and less developed nations alike and social upheaval which can result are the major reasons for the current from such outside control is inmmense worldwide economic convulsions a corallary of this effect is that the the final major effect of capital receiving agency in the recipient coun transfers is one more endemic to the try will

the process of massive capital transfers should beabancloned a major emphasis of all programs should be the development of the individual and the family as the primary agents of economic acti vity the development of a nations people is its most important objective where it is determined that official capital transfers are absolutely required to achieve the objects of economic reform they should be made at market rates of interest and on terms similar to those prevailing in the private market along with promotion of freeenterprise and reduction of capital transfers we shoul d insist that centralized economic planning be pared to the minimum level which assures political stability the return to the market place cannot be made by planners both through example and through active negotiations we must encourage adoption of tax rate reduction a sound monetary standard free trade and free flow of resources our example will be crucial in this continue the process of returning our

we adopt a budget resolution that does not allow any cut in taxes there will not be any or if we adopt a budget resolution like the budget committee has put forward that allows less of a tax cut then we are seeking in the orammlatta substitute then we are going to be bound by those terms as well so as a practical matter the committee on ways and means is not going to send a tax cut bill to the

program the president of the united states has presented to the congress for economic recovery therefore if we wing or injure or handicap or cripple what we are going to be able to subsequently do in the area of tax cuts in part~icular by this budget resolution then we are in effecting winging or handicapping this economic program one of the four parts of the economic recovery program of the president is a sound tax cut program l this tax cut programs life depends upon this budget resolution we are going to adopt basically if we look at what we are hearing in the committee on ways and means i agree wholeheartily with the president of thie united states that we must have a responsible and substantive tax cut program to help solve our economic problems one of the real problems we are having today is that of productivity last year the productivity of the united states was almost dead last when compared to other major industrial nations and for the first time in recent history productivity in this country did not go up it actually declined in 1980 when you have declining productivity your efficiency is going down the ability to produce goods and services is going down in terms of competition with foreign count~ries and in terms of any kind of real growth in this country which means inflation as it costs more to produce something that is inflation as you produce less of something in comparison to foreign competition that is inflation an ople work less hard because there is no incentive because you are not taking home any more money because of high tax rates that is inflation so basically what we believe land strongly believe is that the only real way we can address this problem of productivity is to cut taxes in a meaningful way to cut taxes to make it possible to improve productivity now we do that in this fashion the reason we have to cut these taxes is to mak~e capital available i think everybody understands that the way you retool or modernize a factory the way you have a plant expand and the way to create jobs and the way you are able to keep up with japanese competition in steel and automobiles is to spend money or capital on these factories and these plants where does this capital come from you cannot expect businesses and individuals today to borrow money not at 15 percent and the prime rate continuing to climb as a matter of fact the amount of money american business is borrowing is unhealthy they ought to be generating that capital in aftertax income we oughtto be encouraging individuals to invest money and this is not true under the current tax situation we have in this country so basically if we cut tax rates we generate capital rm aing with the individual who can tnivest money received in a tax cut and put it back i the depository institutions in this country where we need it to lower interest rates we let business have additional profits after their taxes as they will be able to plow capital back into their businesses to retool and modernize there is a new wrinkle we ought to think about too as we reduce the individual tax burden we are letting the taxpayer see he has more after tax income than before and just maybe he will work a little bit harder how many people do we know now who take off a full days work because they are paying too much in taxes in my part of the country a lot of folks will take off for deer hunting season and not work for a month or two because it costs too much to werk they can make almost as much on food stamps and unemployment compensation as they can working and paying taxes as long as we h ave that kind of situation existing in this country we are going to have iflation and low productivity we have to make it possible for people to make more money and keep more of what they earn the same thing is true of the business community to be able to invest that capital to be able to retool modernize our industrial base to keep up with the japanese and germans and to also be able to have people see it pays more to work than it does to play so we have to have capital to solve our problems of productivity and productivity is one of the biggest solutions to our problem of inflation in the year 1980 according to an artide i read the other day in my home town newspaper taxes on a family making about 30 000 a year a family of four went up 25 percent by virtue of their federal tax burdensin 1 year 25 percent in 1965 only 7 percent of all of our taxpayers paid the marginal tax rate of more than 25 percent by 1977 that figure had grown from 7 percent to 30 percent of the american people who were paying more than this because of bracket creep and because of tax increase~s these dual perils are continuing to push more and miore of our taxpayers into higher tax brackets with no more real income to spend by virtue of inflation and these tax increases individuals need a tax break in this country they need it to be able to work harder they need it to be able to make ends meet and they need it out of a spirit of fairness but what i am contending goes beyond that we must have these tax cuts to actually make it possible for our economy to grow and to expand and to hire more people and take care of the people in this country who are less fortunate and have no opportuni ties as the gentleman spoke so eloquently about a mioment ago now if we look at what we have to vote on next tuesday and wednesd~ay in light of the need for tax cuts this might color our final decision first of all we have the substitute by the gentleman from the district of columbia"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "15 months ago we inaugurated a new presidenta new president who brought a vigorous new approach to the solutions of the problems confronting this nation and the world by their votes the people of this nation indicated they wanted a change in direction and this president offered a change he promised to try and reduce federal spending he promised to try to cut the destructive high inflation rate he promised to reduce the unwarranted and unnecessary federal interference in our daily lives with the help in some cases reluctant help of the 535 members of congress this president has made a new beginning he was not able to reduce federal spending but he did cut my more than half the request for increased federal spending he was not able to eliminate all the unnecessary redtape but he was able to reduce the number of pages of regulations printed in the federal register from 73 000 to 51 000 he was not able to end inflation but he did cut the rate which had been in double digit figures for most of the previous administration down to an annualized rate in the month of march of less than 4 percent for the past 5 or 6 months we have been provided with a consistent diet of bad news the morning newspaper headlines and the evening television news emphasize what they perceive to be wrong with the presidents program and ignore what many common folk perceive to be right with the presidents program nowhere has this consistent criticism of the reagan administration been more pernicious than it has been in the reports of central and latin america and particularly the reports from el salvador now i call your attention to some good news and to underscore the importance of this good news permit me to review in some detail what has been going on in el salvador mr speaker in land area this nation is about the size of your own state of massachusetts it is bordered by guatemala on the north honduras on the east and nicaragua on the southeast with about 135 miles of frontage on the pacific ocean about 5 million people live in el salvador el salvador became independent of spain in 1821 and of the central american federation in 1841 about 10 percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and different attitude toward the role of the federal government in our everyday lives is a remarkable change we spent billions to create the great society and are we better off for all that public money spent the crime rate in evcry category is up we spent billions of public money in the war on poverty there is still great misery and poverty in this country the reagan administration understands that you cannot give somebody something without ultimately destroying the recipient of your gift the reagan administration is determined to get the government out of the way and to encourage the individuals to be responsible for their own destiny with an assist for all those who are genuinely incapable of caring for themselves as i go about the 4th district in arizona i find the people expressing new confidence and new hope sure things are difficult right now they say but it is going to be better when i visit the young people i find them sober and serious and determined to make progress on their own just this spring an amazing thing has occurred organized labor has voluntarily accepted a reduction in wages and fringe benefits in order to keep their industries in a better competitive position the presidents proposal to improve our defense capability is under

august 23 1939 offered to nazi germany a welcome pretense for starting world war ii and allowed parts of eastern europe including the three baltic nationsestonia latvia and lithuaniato become part of soviet russias socalled sphere of influence consequently stalin received a free hand to forcibly annex these three independent baltic countries which remain illegally occupied by the unitedstatess r to this day soon after the conclusion of this pact estonia signed on september 28 1930 under military threat and without the possibility of any help from aboard a pact of mutual assistance with the soviet union during the period of 20 years which the estonian people enjoyed their independence they demonstrated what a small nation is able to achieve in all fields while enjoying a democratic way of life they achieved an exceptionally high educational level the history of estonian literature was documented by the publication of the first book in the estonian language in 1935 the estonian people may also be particularly proud of their agricultural accomplishments and impressive industrial achievements during this time their folklore continues to win recognition for its originality colorful variety and great artistic value as a result of the soviet invasion in 1940 this prosperous life came to an abrupt end by the brutal acts of their large totalitarian neighbor since then the estonian people have suffered extremely heavy human and material losses this situation still persists estonia is economically exploited by the moscow legime those who dare make any requests for freedom and justice relying on the stipulations of the helsinki final act are either confined to mental hospitals or sentenced to prison terms one case in particular that of mart niklus an estonian scientist is typical of those whose only crime is a desire to join their relatives outside the unitedstatess r mart niklus has been harassed by soviet authorities for 22 years and arrested numerous

commitments with respect to the protection of human rights nevertheless many estonians have managed to flee from the communist terror in their homeland and are now living in various parts of the free
