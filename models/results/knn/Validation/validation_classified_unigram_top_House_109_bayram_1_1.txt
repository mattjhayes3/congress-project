providing a coordinated aviation response during national emergencies is only a part of the underlying mission for most nonprofit volunteer organizations their most common mission is to provide

of the volunteer protection act in its current form this legislation addressds this mission by amending the volunteer protection act to include organizations such as angel flight so they may continue

that this legislation does not shield pilots from liability in instances of criminal misconduct or gross negligence instead this legislation provides nonprofit volunteer pilot organizations the

sergeant weirs mother and father 2 days ago lynn and jackie weir and it is just extraordinary to me that there are families in this country that love freedom so much love our country so much that even in the most grief and sadness they could ever imagine or experience a hundred percent believe in the mission the service the sacrifice of their own son to defend liberty for our nation lynn weir told me that if he would have tried and he didnt to keep his son from going he could not have kept his son from going he said david weir from the time he was a little boy wanted to serve his country in uniform he was a member of the 101st airborne this was his career this was his way of life he leaves a wife behind alison a little 18monthold son gavin who does not understand what has happened but everyone else knows very clearly what has happened a great american patriot died doing what he wanted to do which was to stand in harms way on behalf of our civilian population as the greatest generation did as other generations have been called to at a time when there is a very real and imminent threat to our way of life called the islamic jihadists and sergeant weir goes to heaven leaves

to alison and to gavin your father your husband chris his brother your son gave his life for everyone in our country we will never forget him we will always remember him we hail his life a sacrificial

continue to attempt to disrupt a young emerging democracy the insurgents are capitalizing on the inexperience of this government and directly causing the sectarian violence and socalled fueling the fire they get more and more strength and resolve when they hear the discourse in our country they know it is only a matter of time before we give up because we perceive the war in iraq is too difficult we all know anything worthwhile is not easy freedom is not free the iraqis are trying to make itwork if we retreat the terrorists win they win now and they win in the future when they have a safe haven to plan train and operate and attack us again it is our choice we are either going to support our efforts to win the global war on terror or we are going to support those that want to retreat inside our borders and wait for the next attack we found out on 9 11 if we retreat they attack finally why did we go to iraq ask yourself why did we fight germany in world war 11 japan attacked us not germany the same principle applies we couldnt take the chance then and we cant now those that say otherwise are sympathizing with the enemy that is from lieutenant colonel brett hale to me on the ground in iraq what a patriot as he says the word is not getting out in this country in a fair way of the progress that we are mak ing as general casey said if we leave they will follow us home these threats are real i have been down here 4 weeks in a row as i have been in washington to try to go through the severity of these real threats around the world and the fact that the jihadists are spreading like wildfire through europe read the book while europe slept read the book londonstan you will know that through the mosques there is a radicalization under way even the pope cant speak of it because it is not politically correct to say that fanaticism in religion is not good for the world it ought to be obvious regardless of what the religion is or how many there are or what is politically correct fanaticism does lead to holy wars and the crusades and we dont want that we want the mullahs and the ayatollahs to condemn suicide bombings we want peace and security for the world we want our allies to have a backbone and stand up and acknowledge the threat we want our president to go to the united nations and say we cant appease other countries we have to stand behind security for all and freedom for people and liberty everywhere we are all amazed in this country that from our own hemisphere to the south the president of venezuela comes to our country and says this hugo chavez is his name in this country we call each other out of respect even the people who just spoke whom i couldnt disagree with more the people who just spoke are all talking politics they are all interested in the next election not frankly the future of our country and preserving liberty and standing up and meeting the challenge of this generation it is all for them about 47 days from now in an election instead of i believe in my gut standing up and protecting our country but despite that because we are decent reasonable we call them honorable we call each other honorable

nation it dishonors everyone south of here in our hemisphere because what it does is it causes people in this country not to trust or even like people who come into this country and say what president hugo chavez said yesterday he said this the devil was here yesterday it still smells of sulfur around here he added he said the president of the united states the gentleman to whom i refer as the devil came here talking as if he owned the world truly as the owner of the world i think we could call a psychiatrist to analyze yesterdays statement made by the president of the united states as the spokesman of imperialism he came to share his nostrums to try to preserve the current pattern of domination exploitation and pillage of the peoples of the world he said the president of the united states came to talk to the peoplesto the peoples of world what would those peoples of the world tell him if they were given the floor i think i have some inkling of what the peoples of the south the oppressed peoples think they would say yankee imperialist go home i have the feeling dear world dictator that you are going to live the rest of your days as a nightmare because the rest of us are

they voted for him or not i just want to make it abundantly clear to hugo chavez or any other president do not come to the united states and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that americans do not feel offended when you offend our commander in chief thank you charlie rangel for being an honorable democrat who stands united at this time of war hugo chavez is a troublemaker in a big way he wants to work with iranian president ahmadinejad i watched his interview last night on anderson cooper and he calmly looked anderson cooper in the eyes and he gave a very warped view of history not even willing to acknowledge that the holocaust took place completely in denial you would have to wonder where in the world he gets his facts or his view of the world this is a troubling time in american history i say to young people everywhere i go the days ahead will be very very difficult we need to be honest with them about this but the character of this great nation was born out of the sacrifices the courage and the willingness to face these challenges of our grandparents and our greatgrand7 parents the greatest generation they are the standard for stepping up to meeting global challenges and they gave us our character we didnt get our character by the big buildings or wall street or wealth or even military power we got it by sacrifice and dedication and commitment and family and they are the standard they didnt cower or retreat from these challenges they stood up they faced them head on they showed us what it took to preserve freedom and extend it from one generation to the next and we must do the same thing we must come together as a nation i hate it that we are in the middle of this political campaign while we are at war because it is not good for us to say the things we say even on the floor of this house it is not good for lieutenant colonel hale and others to look back here and see the potshots being fired i hate it that over half of the democrats in the senate voted to remove saddam hussein by force and almost half of the democrats voted and now they all say it was a mistake let me tell you there has never been a pretty war never there has never been one perfectly executed and you do not remove a genocidal mass murderer with a picnic it is ugly and a brand new democracy takes a while to

stephen flynn of the council on foreign relations testified before congress we need to khow whats in the box more than we need to know who is moving them around a container yard so if our concern truly is port security why are we not focusing on supporting that overall effort the fact is that dubai ports world is of course involved with the jebel ali port one of the largest and among the most advanced ports in the world according to the new york times it is the worlds 11th largest port and annually handles more than 7 5 million containers many of them going directly to and from the united states on a number of issues they have cooperated with the unitedstates government to allow for our inspections robert c bonner formerly with customs was quoted in the new york times dubai has acknowledged the absolute importance of securing cargo against terrorists on cargo security we ought to be concerfied about whats being onloaded in foreign ports just as much as we are concerned about whats being offloaded on our shores once a dangerous ship arrives its far too late for concern so if we trust dubai ports world on the first crucial half of a cargo transactionthe loadingwhy would we not trust the company to be involved in unitedstates cargo operations in a strictly management capacity nonetheless the company has moved forward to sell the operations to a unitedstates buyer dpw

kokomo indiana and when i spoke with her and said maam is there anything that i can do for you or the family she said you cant believe what this has been like and i said well i have two children you are right i cant believe that she said no no you dont understand and then began to convey to me that when i had heard that ricky had died i began receiving family and friends to the home they would

get done i think that what we are running the risk of and you mentioned collateral damage what we run the risk of is losing the ear of the american public not only are they not bringing their children to the television to listen to what we are talking about they are turning us off because they cannot find the truth in what we are saying because we overexaggerate or we try to disparage peoples character or lose respect in our arguments i think if we lose the attention of the american public we run the risk of an apathetic country that no longer cares or has faith in their leadership to be able to cut through and cut to the chase and lead so i think we are not alone in the congress there is a center aisle caucus that was put together with republicans and democrats together to try to

was brought up the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha is one of the finest members of this body and has given his heart to our nation and his wisdom to this congress but underlying concems about the process tonight is the critically important issue regarding the future of unitedstates involvement in iraq the united states commitment to a sta ble and democratic iraq is essential for the future of the region for the larger war on terrorism and for the iraqi people in my ten trips to iraq four times outside the umbrella of the military ive had the opportunity to speak with hundreds of iraqis and can tell you with some certainty about their greatest fear it is not the suicide bombs and other terrorist attacks brought against their countrymen it is the concern that the united states which has helped give them a taste of freedom and democracy will leave them before they are ready to fend for themselves tonight we have the opportunity to proclaim we will not leave you when i hear the critics on this floor or in the news media say our policy is a disaster that we are in a mess in iraq i think of the transfer of power in june 2004 the election in january 2005 the referendum this past october and what i believe will be a huge success in december with the election of a permanent iraqi government i am in awe of what the iraqis have accomplished in such a short period of time regretfully the administration has done a very poor job explaining to the american people why we are there and when and how we intend to leave but this does not mean we dont have an exit strategy we have a strategy but regretfully it has had to be amendedmore than once the united states strategy is to assist the iraqis in creating a secure environment so they can develop their new democratic gov

of people to prison for felony crimes i have heard and seen all kinds of stories but the one that played out last week makes me both heartsick and very angry a valiant vietnam veteran a man of courage and daring a navy pilot a defender of this country an ace a true military leader by example pled guilty basically to accepting bribes to push defense contracts to contractors who may not have been entitled to them for those of us who have served in the military we know what it is to requisition supplies equipment or services and get quality in response on the other hand we also know what it is to receive supplies equipment or services and wonder who in the world got their bank account padded or their back scratched to allow such substandard material to be sent now to hear that our fellow congressman randy duke cunningham was such a member of congress on the take makes me both very sad and very angry mr cunningham has made true acts and comments of contrition and humility but my goodness how much damage has been done not only will he be sentenced to satisfy the requirements of justice retribution and deterrence his family and friends will suffer that is what happens when crimes are committed let us also not lose sight of the fact that the contractors who paid bribes should be barred from ever contracting with the government again i do not know who it is and it does not matter to me who they are or with whom they are friends they should be barred but one other thing that has caused me great bewilderment in the last month to 6 weeks or so is the rhetoric against our efforts in iraq and how it has reached a crescendo and fanatical pitch in what may well have been the cradle of mankind the people of iraq are on the threshold of democratically electing their first permanent leaders under their new constitution as a democratic selfgoverning people we should as a nation be uniting in support and encouraging the people of iraq in their own efforts at selfgovernment some like our colleague and war hero mr murtha have been expressing concerns of this type about the war for over 2 years others have now jumped on the bandwagon and still others have raised their pitch dramatically this historic election is 9 days off it is true that if the election goes well it not only is a great victory for freedom democracy and against terrorism but it will probably help president bush it is also clear and many realize if the election goes badly it will probably exacerbate and lower president bushs popularity still further but could members not wait 9 days wait until after december 15 to make your points about withdrawal or how we are losing and we cannot win obviously if the people of iraq think we are about to withdraw before that permanent ink wears off their finger when they vote they may hesitate to vote or not vote heightened rhetoric against our historic assistance in iraq serves to undermine the election and may assist in its failure i implore members regarding iraq please let us put partisan politics aside for the next 9 days until after the election sure it would make you happy to see president bushs numbers fall lower but at the cost of democracy and stability in the middle east and of our own safety the price is too high you can go back to your bush bashing in 9 days but how about being statesmen and stateswomen until after the iraqi election show that there is one noble thing you can put above partisan politics for the next 9 days we are doing a great good over there i have seen senator lieberman has seen it mr shays

so much that even in the most grief and sadness they could ever imagine or experience a hundred percent believe in the mission the service the sacrifice of their own son to defend liberty for our nation lynn weir told me that if he would have tried and he didnt to keep his son from going he could not have kept his son from going he said david weir from the time he was a little boy wanted to

they continue to attempt to disrupt a young emerging democracy the insurgents are capitalizing on the inexperience of this government and directly causing the sectarian violence and socalled fueling the fire they get more and more strength and resolve when they hear the discourse in our country they know it is only a matter of time before we give up because we perceive the war in iraq is too difficult we all know anything worthwhile is not easy freedom is not free the iraqis are trying to make itwork if we retreat the terrorists win they win now and they win in the future when they have a safe haven to plan train and operate and attack us again it is our choice we are either going to support our efforts to win the global war on terror or we are going to support those that want to retreat inside our borders and wait for the next attack we found out on 9 11 if we retreat they attack finally why did we go to iraq ask yourself why did we fight germany in world war 11 japan attacked us not germany the same principle applies we couldnt take the chance then and we cant now those that say otherwise are sympathizing with the enemy that is from lieutenant colonel brett hale

us home these threats are real i have been down here 4 weeks in a row as i have been in washington to try to go through the severity of these real threats around the world and the fact that the

cant speak of it because it is not politically correct to say that fanaticism in religion is not good for the world it ought to be obvious regardless of what the religion is or how many there are or

says this hugo chavez is his name in this country we call each other out of respect even the people who just spoke whom i couldnt disagree with more the people who just spoke are all talking politics they are all interested in the next election not frankly the future of our country and preserving liberty and standing up and meeting the challenge of this generation it is all for them about 47 days from now in an election instead of i believe in my gut standing up and protecting our country but despite that because we are decent reasonable we call them honorable we call each other honorable

nation it dishonors everyone south of here in our hemisphere because what it does is it causes people in this country not to trust or even like people who come into this country and say what president hugo chavez said yesterday he said this the devil was here yesterday it still smells of sulfur around here he added he said the president of the united states the gentleman to whom i refer as the devil came here talking as if he owned the world truly as the owner of the world i think we could call a psychiatrist to analyze yesterdays statement made by the president of the united states as the spokesman of imperialism he came to share his nostrums to try to preserve the current pattern of domination exploitation and pillage of the peoples of the world he said the president of the united states came to talk to the peoplesto the peoples of world what would those peoples of the world tell him if they were given the floor i think i have some inkling of what the peoples of the south the oppressed peoples think they would say yankee imperialist go home i have the feeling dear world dictator that you are going to live the rest of your days as a nightmare because the rest of us are

this and let us praise a democrat in this house named charlie rangel whom i seldom agree with but boy do i appreciate his patriotism in defense of our country and its traditions when he said this today he said you do not come into my country my congressional district and you do not condemn my president if there is any criticism of president bush it should be restricted to americans whether they voted for him or not i just want to make it abundantly clear to hugo chavez or any other president do not come to the united states and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that americans do not feel offended when you offend our commander in chief thank you charlie rangel for being an honorable democrat who stands united at this time of war hugo chavez is a troublemaker in a big way he wants to work with iranian president ahmadinejad i watched his interview last night on anderson cooper and he calmly looked anderson cooper in the eyes and he gave a very warped view of history not even willing to acknowledge that the holocaust took place completely in denial you would have to wonder where in the world he gets his facts or his view of the world this is a troubling time in american history i say to young people everywhere i go the days ahead will be very very difficult we need to be honest with them about this but the character of this great nation was born out of the sacrifices the courage and the willingness to face these challenges of our grandparents and our greatgrand7 parents the greatest generation they are the standard for stepping up to meeting global challenges and they gave us our character we didnt get our character by the big buildings or wall street or wealth or even military power we got it by sacrifice and dedication and commitment and family and they are the standard they didnt cower or retreat from these challenges they stood up they faced them head on they showed us what it took to preserve freedom and extend it from one generation to the next and we must do the same thing we must come together as a nation i hate it that we are in the middle of this political campaign while we are at war because it is not good for us to say the things we say even on the floor of this house it is not good for lieutenant colonel hale and others to look back here and see the potshots being fired i hate it that over half of the democrats in the senate voted to remove saddam hussein by force and almost half of the democrats voted and now they all say it was a mistake let me tell you there has never been a pretty war never there has never been one perfectly executed and you do not remove a genocidal mass murderer with a picnic it is ugly and a brand new democracy takes a while to develop and it is tough tough but thank goodness that men and women in uniform will volunteer to go serve and carry out this tough mission and extend liberty from one generation to the next these are

on this most important issue of global security"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "as stewards of hardworking americans tax dollars we cannot ask our constituents to fund the killing of human embryos like the rest of my colleagues joining me today i am strongly in support of scientific research to save and improve human life but to fund federal research on stem cells derived from killing human embryos is unethical and irresponsible while stem cell research has never been prohibited in the private sector president bush permitted the usage of embryonic stem cell lines sufficient for extensive governmentfunded research nearly 4 years ago in these 4 years government and private research on those stem cells have produced nothing cured no one and there is no indication that that will change in the meantime ethical research not derived from embryos in the public and private sectors has helped cure almost 60 diseases the private sector has proven the superiority and promise of cord blood in adult stem cell research by choosing to fund those areas let us learn from their example and not squander taxpayer dollars on unethical research we do have the power of the purse and we cannot misuse it by funding the slaughter of human life"]]}
