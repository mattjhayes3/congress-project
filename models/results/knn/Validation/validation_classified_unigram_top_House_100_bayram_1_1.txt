with top yugoslav defense officials unprecedented military cooperation including the construction of components of united states military hardware in yugoslavia and united states supply of sophisticated military material to enable yugoslavia to modernize its defense forces yugoslav sources explained that they could produce spare parts more cheaply than could united states plants unitedstates assistance to a communist dictatorship would seem selfdefeating but since the allied betrayal of general mihailovich and the forces struggling against the nazi and communist tyrannies in world war ii the united state department has perpetuated the notion that yugoslavia represents communism with a difference in this regard our state department treatment of yugoslav communism is similar to our state department treatment of romania the fiction is preserved that romania too is communism with a difference and despite its horrifying human rights record mostfavorednation treatment is allegedly a way of wooing ceaucescu from the soviet orbit our former ambassador to romania david funderburk in his book pinstripes and reds explodes this myth but not the momentum in the bowels of state that continues to push for such policies the yugoslavs can indeed produce united states military equipment more cheaply than can unitedstates plants workers on the production line at the yugo plant make as little as 25 cents an hour certainly this is a factor behind the anticipated mass strikes in yugoslavia this fall as it should be any american concerned about fair labor standards and unfair trade practices should keep this in mind before considering purchase of a yugo car given this grass exploitation moreover the communist dictators of yugoslavia share another common feature with ceaucescuthey are hopelessly corrupt while ceaucescu sells human beings who want to emigrate the communist officials in yugoslavia who are running state enterprises have fraudulently issued promissory notes to the tune of at least 2 billion for theirown personal h 8288 co gain at the same time what hadbeen the most prosperous and productive country in the balkan region prior to world war i has been transformed by the communists since wwii into a terminal economic patient kept alive through such unitedstates life support systems as commercial and multinational lending institutions and preferential access to unitedstates markets yugoslavias outstanding world debt is pushing 19 billion their inflation rate is well over 100 percent and their unemployment stands at almost 17 percent

abbas was rescued and provided sanctuary in yugoslavia by that governments secret police this is the same government that sold minisubs to colonel qadhafi to be used against unitedstates ships in the mediterranean and cbs released on unconfirmed report that yugoslavia has sold sophisticated sea mines to the ayatollah khomeini to be used against american vessels in the persian gulf this is totally consistent behavior by an arms supplier to vietnam north korea angola nicaragua and the communist terrorists in el salvador there is also a confirmed report that the yugoslav government is producing sophisticated minirockets designed exclusively for the use of terrorists and it is as naive to believe that any yugoslav access to new technology is not immediately transferred to the soviet union as it is to believe that ceaucescu does not serve as an immediate conduit for the soviets if all of this were not enough the peoples militia in yugoslavia has responded to protests by everyone from students and intellectuals to workers and minorities with brutal repression in the kosovo region the governments actions amount to genocide and thoughout all of this our state department pursues a

another has not done enough or states have not done enough but we arp not really going to get to the crux of the problem until we have a comprehensive approach which involves for the very first time a recognition of the fact that until you change the attitude toward drug users in this country you are not going to change the equation that presently exists i ask simply what is the impact on the young people of today when they see professional football players slapped on the wrist for 30 days and supposedly beginning their drug rehabilitation by playing golf what do they think when they hear on the floor of the house that we should excuse drug traffickers because they happen to be veterans i heard someone ask how can we take a particular benefit away from somebody when their service in vietnam drove them to trafficking in drugs is that the message you want to send forward do you want to send a message forward that in a courtroom in america that if someone is a drug trafficker they can say they got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore they are excused i am concerned about veterans of america and concerned about the vietnam veterans but more concerned about the young people of america today in this respect what i heard on the floor is that if a trafficker sells drugs to my son or your son or grandson that person ought to receive special treatment because that person happened to be a veteran we made an exemption because we understood the problem of drug usage among some that returned from vietnam you do not suffer the same disability under the mccollum amendment if you are merely using drugs and convicted of use if you happen to be a veteran they are therefore given a special exemption but when their action rises to the question of drug trafficking we say that at that we draw the line we dont take away your health benefit we dont take away your retirement benefit we protect those but other types of benefits we are going to subject to penalty why do we do that because we have tried the purely criminal sanction route and we have recognized that is not sufficient we have to send a message that is more than that we have to change the culture of america with respect to usage of drugs that is why the amendment is crucial it goes to the question of true user accountability unfortunately the rangel substitute guts the effectiveness of this crucial amendment this amendment may be more important than any other single amendment we have here because it reflects a change in attitude of our approach on the drug problem we can talk big we can have mandatory penalties but if we excuse the users as we have done time and time again if we now excuse the trafficker because the trafficker happens to be a veteran we are going to send the wrong message

policy although i have always been a strong proponent of sanctions legislation and fully understand that south africa has made no visible progress in ending apartheid despite passage of previous sanctions legislation i have some serious reservations about this bill h r as the ranking republican on the banking committee let me address one problem in this bill with reepect to bank loans under this bill banks will not be able to reschedule existing loans with south africa because of the debt moratorium that south africa imposed after the first sanctions bill no payments are being made under original loan terms thus united states banks will have no other alternative then to sell the loans because they will become uncollectible under original terms the bottom line impact is that united states banks stand to lose over a billion dollars and our banks loss will become the south african governments gain it is inconceivable to me that the authors of this legislation would want to confer such a windfall on the south african government i should make the point that no new lending has occured since the last sanctions bill the only new money flowing into south africa has been shortterm trade financing which will be prevented under this bill additionally no new investment has been allowed either the first sanctions bill was a positive step forward which banned new banks loans but to allow the south africans to excuse their debt now is in my opinion not a sanction other provisions of the bill are also troublesome for instance unitedstates investors big and small may lose over a billion dollars because of the mandated disinvestment also the breaking of all intelligence ties between our two nations is mandated by this bill despite the strategic location of south africa t

broomfield alternative suggests moreover thl burton substitute would specifically attempt to improve black economic power in south africa while maintaining the existing sanctions both of these objectives are laudableand notably lacking in h r 1580 h r 1580 in its present form is a solo effort because we do not have indications that other nations plan to follow our lead in the sanctions effort will blacks have more economic power if we pass this bill most likely notand therefore their leverage for change will diminish in the final analysis what we are doing here is simply sending a signal that we will have nothing to do with south africa it is a symbolic move and i can understand that approach but with respect to real economic harm to the south african government and economy i really dont believe that there will be any significant impact from the sanctions contained in h r 1580 as i mentioned i have supported sanctions in the past on every occasion i favor more punitive action against south africa but i believe that this legislation needs to be improved as it stands unitedstates banks and investors will be injured with no corresponding benefit or gain to the black

care by identifying exemplary centerbased child development centers these models will recruit train support and monitor family care pro viders that now often operate unregulated and are difficult for potential consumers to locate it enables child care providers to inform parents of their services while encouraging family care providers to associate with high quality child development models children also benefit from enhanced care while the emotional security of a sustained relationship with their provider is encouraged through continuity these model centers also include a child care information center and community outreach program to encourage potential child care providers i am pleased to promote a program that provides our parents the freedom to choose quality child care options that suit their individual needs i invite my colleagues to join me in support of this program"]], "top_unsure": [[0.5, 0.0, 0, "a bartmletr chairman of the board the f a bartlett tree expert

liberties union that is his right members of congress may belong individual citizens may belong and thus they have the right to set their own agendas the question is whether the american people want the aclu agenda to be their agenda when they are dealing with law enforcement issues that is a very important question because we have been forced to deal over the last number of years to only during election periods with tough law enforcement questions it is only at such times when we are allowed to have an opportunity to vote on the floor that we find that the american people as represented by their representatives here in the house vote for the death penalty vote for an exclusionary rule exception vote for denial of bail to those who have proven to dangerous to themselves and others yet all of those positions are rejected by the aclu the question is if we had a president of the united states dedicated to the aclu position on all of those issues would we ever have legislation of that

military cooperation by andrew borowiec it indicated that a united states congressional delegation discussed with top yugoslav defense officials unprecedented military cooperation including the construction of components of united states military hardware in yugoslavia and united states supply of sophisticated military material to enable yugoslavia to modernize its defense forces yugoslav sources explained that they could produce spare parts more cheaply than could united states plants unitedstates assistance to a communist dictatorship would seem selfdefeating but since the allied betrayal of general mihailovich and the forces struggling against the nazi and communist tyrannies in world war ii the united state department has perpetuated the notion that yugoslavia represents communism with a difference in this regard our state department treatment of yugoslav communism is similar to our state department treatment of romania the fiction is preserved that romania too is communism with a difference and despite its horrifying human rights record mostfavorednation treatment is allegedly a way of wooing ceaucescu from the soviet orbit our former ambassador to romania david funderburk in his book pinstripes and reds explodes this myth but not the momentum in the bowels of state that continues to push for such policies the yugoslavs can indeed produce united states military equipment more cheaply than can unitedstates plants workers on the production line at the yugo plant make as little as 25 cents an hour certainly this is a factor behind the anticipated mass strikes in yugoslavia this fall as it should be any american concerned about fair labor standards and unfair trade practices should keep this in mind before considering purchase of a yugo car given this grass exploitation moreover the communist dictators of yugoslavia share another common feature with ceaucescuthey are hopelessly corrupt while ceaucescu sells human beings who want to emigrate the communist officials in yugoslavia who are running state enterprises have fraudulently issued promissory notes to the tune of at least 2 billion for theirown personal h 8288 co gain at the same time what hadbeen the most prosperous and productive country in the balkan region prior to world war i has been transformed by the communists since wwii into a terminal economic patient kept alive through such unitedstates life support systems as commercial and multinational lending institutions and preferential access to unitedstates markets yugoslavias outstanding world debt is pushing 19 billion their inflation rate is well over 100 percent and their unemployment stands at almost 17 percent small wonder then that yugoslav officials would salivate over the prospect of increased business with the united statesat the expense of united state jobs and security one must keep security in mind when dealing with any communist regime yugoslavia for example has maintained training camps for world terrorists have americans forgotten too that the architect of the achille lauro hijacking abu abbas was rescued and provided sanctuary in yugoslavia by that governments secret police this is the same government that sold minisubs to colonel qadhafi to be used against unitedstates ships in the mediterranean and cbs released on unconfirmed report that yugoslavia has sold sophisticated sea mines to the ayatollah khomeini to be used against american vessels in the persian gulf this is totally consistent behavior by an arms supplier to vietnam north korea angola nicaragua and the communist terrorists in el salvador there is also a confirmed report that the yugoslav government is producing sophisticated minirockets designed exclusively for the use of terrorists and it is as naive to believe that any yugoslav access to new technology is not immediately transferred to the soviet union as it is to believe that ceaucescu does not serve as an immediate conduit for the soviets if all of this were not enough the peoples militia in yugoslavia has responded to protests by everyone from students and intellectuals to workers and minorities with brutal repression in the kosovo region the governments actions amount to genocide and thoughout all of this our state department pursues a policy of silence and promotion of the fiction that this is

to win the war on drugs until we change the culture of america with respect to the use and toleration of drug use we can point all the fingers we want to mexico to other south and central american countries to the golden triangle and other parts of the world we can say all we want to about how one administration or another has not done enough or states have not done enough but we arp not really going to get to the crux of the problem until we have a comprehensive approach which involves for the very first time a recognition of the fact that until you change the attitude toward drug users in this country you are not going to change the equation that presently exists i ask simply what is the impact on the young people of today when they see professional football players slapped on the wrist for 30 days and supposedly beginning their drug rehabilitation by playing golf what do they think when they hear on the floor of the house that we should excuse drug traffickers because they happen to be veterans i heard someone ask how can we take a particular benefit away from somebody when their service in vietnam drove them to trafficking in drugs is that the message you want to send forward do you want to send a message forward that in a courtroom in america that if someone is a drug trafficker they can say they got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore they are excused i am concerned about veterans of america and concerned about the vietnam veterans but more concerned about the young people of america today in this respect what i heard on the floor is that if a trafficker sells drugs to my son or your son or grandson that person ought to receive special treatment because that person happened to be a veteran we made an exemption because we understood the problem of drug usage among some that returned from vietnam you do not suffer the same disability under the mccollum amendment if you are merely using drugs and convicted of use if you happen to be a veteran they are therefore given a special exemption but when their action rises to the question of drug trafficking we say that at that we draw the line we dont take away your health benefit we dont take away your retirement benefit we protect those but other types of benefits we are going to subject to penalty why do we do that because we have tried the purely criminal sanction route and we have recognized that is not sufficient we have to send a message that is more than that we have to change the culture of america with respect to usage of drugs that is why the amendment is crucial it goes to the question of true user accountability unfortunately the rangel substitute guts the effectiveness of this crucial amendment this amendment may be more important than any other single amendment we have here because it reflects a change in attitude of our approach on the drug problem we can talk big we can have mandatory penalties but if we excuse the users as we have done time and time again if we now excuse the trafficker because the trafficker happens to be a veteran we are going to send the wrong message to america if we want to save this generation of young people if we want to save the next generation we have to do more than we have done before we have to establish user accountability and that means changing the rules of the game that we have had thus far is this something new

discrimination apartheid is abhorrent and i agree that the united states should not stand by and ignore the continuation of this policy although i have always been a strong proponent of sanctions legislation and fully understand that south africa has made no visible progress in ending apartheid despite passage of previous sanctions legislation i have some serious reservations about this bill h r as the ranking republican on the banking committee let me address one problem in this bill with reepect to bank loans under this bill banks will not be able to reschedule existing loans with south africa because of the debt moratorium that south africa imposed after the first sanctions bill no payments are being made under original loan terms thus united states banks will have no other alternative then to sell the loans because they will become uncollectible under original terms the bottom line impact is that united states banks stand to lose over a billion dollars and our banks loss will become the south african governments gain it is inconceivable to me that the authors of this legislation would want to confer such a windfall on the south african government i should make the point that no new lending has occured since the last sanctions bill the only new money flowing into south africa has been shortterm trade financing which will be prevented under this bill additionally no new investment has been allowed either the first sanctions bill was a positive step forward which banned new banks loans but to allow the south africans to excuse their debt now is in my opinion not a sanction other provisions of the bill are also troublesome for instance unitedstates investors big and small may lose over a billion dollars because of the mandated disinvestment also the breaking of all intelligence ties between our two nations is mandated by this bill despite the strategic location of south africa t enetrage my colleagues to support tht 1roomfield alternative as a more sensiole in their approach to this problem we should seek allied strength if these sanctions are to be effective as the broomfield alternative suggests moreover thl burton substitute would specifically attempt to improve black economic power in south africa while maintaining the existing sanctions both of these objectives are laudableand notably lacking in h r 1580 h r 1580 in its present form is a solo effort because we do not have indications that other nations plan to follow our lead in the sanctions effort will blacks have more economic power if we pass this bill most likely notand therefore their leverage for change will diminish in the final analysis what we are doing here is simply sending a signal that we will have nothing to do with south africa it is a symbolic move and i can understand that approach but with respect to real economic harm to the south african government and economy i really dont believe that there will be any significant impact from the sanctions contained in h r 1580 as i mentioned i have supported sanctions in the past on every occasion i favor more punitive action against south africa but i believe that this legislation needs to be improved as it stands unitedstates banks and investors will be injured with no corresponding benefit or gain to the black majority in south africa moreover this legislation will provide a significant financial windfall for the south african government and i fall to understand how that is a sanction i am hopeful that the authors of this bill will set politics aside and support an
