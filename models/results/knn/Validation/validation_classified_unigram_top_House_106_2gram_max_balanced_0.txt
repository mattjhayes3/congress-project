agreement providing for the withdrawal of yugoslavian troops from kosovo and the deployment of international peacekeeping forces it is vital that we not forget the american troops who continue to languish in kosovo or those in bosnia and other fellow citizens scattered throughout the world on various deployments we should also consider the cost of these deployments both in dollars and in reduction of our military capability president clintons decision to attack yugoslavia and to maintain peacekeeping forces in kosovo were based upon the mistaken notion that military forces can turn ethnic and religious hatred into peaceful coexistence as a participant in the kosovo peacekeeping operation known as kfor the united states has 5 000 troops in kosovo 450 in macedonia and 10 in greece while working to achieve this harmony unitedstates troops have been fired upon and assaulted in many instances census figures collected by the u n high commission for refugees andthe yugoslavian government indicate that 93 percent of the population of kosovo is ethnic albanians now and 5 percent serbs in essence american troons rre in kosovo to protect the serbs from an angry majority this makes the presidents plan to build a peaceful multiethnic state all the more daunting this situation begs the question when will our troops leave kosovo if the clinton administration has its way the answer is no time soon all we need to do is to look at bosnia to explain this conclusion remember bosnia in 1996 the united states sent 16 500 troops to bosnia and some 6 000 support troops to neighboring nations the president stated that the deployment would last about 1 year the troops are still there and the administration has requested 1 4 billion for the next fiscal year to continue this 1year mission to bosnia it seems that much the same is expected for kosovo two american camps in that region are being expanded to house and support american soldiers for at least 3 to 5 more years more troubling is the assessment of the top unitedstates commander in kosovo according to the boston globe that commander brigadier general sanchez stated that the mission will require nato peacekeepers to remain there for at least a generation can we expect some of these nato troops to be american we should also consider the cost of these deployments up to last year 9 08 billion has been appropriated for bosnia operations with the expenditure for this fiscal year and the next the bosnian mission will accumulate costs exceeding 12 billion according to the department of defense the kosovo operation costs 3 billion last year and the estimate for fy 2000 is about 2 billion our peacekeeping operation in the balkans is approaching 20 billion in total expenses in reading a heritage foundation report on this issue i discovered that the pentagon believes that it missed its procurement targets for the past 5 years because of unexpected costs associated with the military operations in kosovo and bosnia this means that we have not met our goals for modernizing our weaponry because of our peacekeeping operations in the balkans by making bosnia and kosovo safer for their citizens we have made america less safe for our citizens is that really the policy results this administration is seeking congress must take steps to ensure that americas national security interests are

fiscal discipline which has produced our budget surplus but only if it is done on a bipartisan basis i urge my democratic colleagues to join us in the pursuit of this goal"]]}
