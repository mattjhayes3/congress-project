corvette came in and were ready to pay cash or a cashiers check to pay for the corvette the dealership did a credit check on this individual and found out that it did not check out they called the fbi they found out that this group had bought a lincoln navigator a cadillac escalade and they were looking at buying a corvette they also bought a home 135 000 so somebody was checking this to see where did this money come from somebody had gone into the computer systems at the department of ed and this is one of their other problems they do not have computer security and had changed the routing so instead of sending this money to an account into the school districts in south dakota the money went into these individuals accounts in washington to the tune of 1 9 million"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "a couple of days ago i was moved by an article that i read about an individual by the name of leonard peltier mr peltier is currently in the penitentiary federal penitentiary for the assassination of two fbi agents he has been in prison for 25 years i need to be fair to all of my colleagues here and give you some disclosures first of all i used to be a police officer as a result of being a police officer over the years and especially during the time of my tenure as a police officer i developed a very close relationship with agents of the federal bu reau of investigation over the years i have also developed a great deal of respect for the federal bureau of investigation but i must also tell my colleagues that over these years i have also had an opportunity to carefully scrutinize the federal bureau of investigation because you see i think it is a very important agency for our country but i think the integrity of the agency is also very very important in the past i have been very critical of the federal bureau of investigation when they messed up i can give you an excellent example ruby ridge the agents involved at ruby ridge in my opinion should have been immediately terminated what happened at ruby ridge i will not repeat this evening but i will tell you that the command officer from the federal bureau of investigation was not terminated in fact the command officer was put on a paid leave of absence for 1 or 2 years and retired and received in my opinion no punishment at all i am also looking with a very careful eye at the federal bureau of investigations role at the waco texas goofup that too is a very tragic situation in the history of our country and i think unfortunately there will be revealed within the report about the incident at waco texas that the federal bureau of investigation misstated their role understated their contribution so to speak or their involveient in the situation at waco texas so i am not necessarily in lockstep with the federal bureau of investigation but i can tell you when i look at all of the law enforcement agencies i have seen over the years and as a former law enforcement officer i have had the opportunity to be involved with many of them at the very highest when you look at the picture as an average the federal bureau of investigation comes out at the very top and i think it isi incumbent colleagues of every one of us when we see an attack launched against the federal bureau of investigation that is launched without justification or when we see an action being taken against the federal bureau of investigation without justification we have a commitment to step forward and say something about it as i mentioned at the beginning of my comments i saw an article the other day about this individual this gentlemans name is leonard peltier i saw today in fact an article in the usa today the article is indians fbi face off in washington first of all i am not sure why the author of the usa today article uses the word indians in a broad or general descriptive form in imy particular district which is the third congressional district of the state of colorado we have the indian tribal lands and i have yet to hear from any of the leaders of those indian tribes of which i work with very closely on projects such as the animus laplata the kind of appeal that may be suggested by all indians as a result of this particular article it is my opinion that the native american involvement in this case is limited and it is also my opinionthat if you sit down with the average native american in this country and you look at the facts of this case that there will be very few native americans who would step forward and say that this particular convict is a political prisoner i think this is a stage being set by the defense attorneys for this convict actually using the word convict is somewhat gentle he is not a convict he is a murderer and he is a coldblooded murderer he killed two fbi agents in cold blood now 25 years ago as one defense attorney would suggest is something that enough time has passed by that perhaps he has served his time for this violent and horrible crime i will quote exactly from the usa today peltier that is the convict the murderer that i am talking about has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in attorney carl nadler says can you believe this let me repeat what this defense attorney says peltier has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in prison what he is suggesting is that 25 years is enough time for somebody to serve that goes out and in cold blood assassinates two officers of the federal bureau of investigation well r stand here tonight colleagues in deep disagreement with this defense attorney and i urge that all of my colleagues on the floor take time to review what is going on in the month of november in regard to this case now why have i suggested the month of november well apparently this murderers defense team has put together a little political show and tell and they call november the month of publicity or the month to get reprieve for this convicted murderer what i mean by that it is this month that they are submitting papers to the president of the united states request ing that clemency be granted to leonard peltier a convicted murderer a couple of days ago i read an open letter this open letter is a joint letter authored by the federal bureau of investigation agents association located in new rochelle new york and the society of former special agents of the federal bureau of investigation located in quantico virginia the above organizations which are professional nongovernmental associations rep resent over 20 000 active duty and former fbi agents i was so moved by this letter that i ask my colleagues to follow me closely this evening as i read verbatim that open letter to the american people as many of you know i do not often read from notes when i speak from this podium but i am going to be very careful this evening that i read this letter verbatim because i think it is important that every one of us in this room have a clear understahding of the facts of this case before peltiers defense attorney arrives here in washington d c sets up this political show and tell and tries to convince through propaganda that for some reason this convicted murderer deserves clemency from the president of the united states we should not take this lightly we had a very difficult situation about 1 month ago when clemency was given to the puerto rican terrorists as i pointed out from this house floor you can look right up in the roof of this fine room and you can see the bullet hole or i could walk over here to this desk drawer and show you the bullet holes through that desk from the puerto rican terrorists who entered this floor many years ago firing weapons well this case is somewhat similar except in this case we know we have the person who conducted two savage cold blooded murders on these fbi agents let me begin the letter june 26 1975 was a hot dusty thursday on the pine ridge indian reservation in southwestern south dakota when two fbi agents arrived from their office in rapid city it was about noon when special agents ronald a williams age 27 and jack r coler age 28 pulled into the jumping bull compound area of the remote reservation seeking to arrest a young man in connection with the recent abduction and assault of two young ranchers observing their suspect peltiers vehicle the agents pursied it unknown to special agent coler and special agent williams one of the three men in the vehicle was leonard peltier a violent man with a violent past he was a fugitive wanted for attempted murder of an off duty milwaukee police officer knowing that the two vehicles pursuing him were occupied by fbi agents and believing they were seeking t arresthim on that attempted murder case peltier and his associates abruptly stopped their vehicle and began firing rifles at the agents surprised by the sudden violence outmanned outgunned and at an extreme tactical disadvantage coler and williams were both wounded and defenseless within minutes coler sustained a severe wound the force of the bullet nearly tearing his right arm off williams wounded in the left shoulder and the right foot removed his shirt during the hail of incoming rifle fire and fashioned a tourniquet around the arm ofcoler who had by then fallen unconscious agents coler and williams were then at the mercy of leonard peltier and his associates but there was to be no mercy for these fine young law enforcement officers not satisfied with the terrible injuries that they had inflicted peltier and the two other men walked down the hill towards the ambushed agents three shots were fired from peltiers rifle williams kneeling and apparently surrendering was shot in the face directly through his out extended shielding handled he died instantly coler who was still unconscious was shot twice in the head at closerange he died instantly from those shots the crime scene examination testified to the brutality of the ambush coler and williams had little chance to defend themselves they had fired only five shots in contrast over 125 bullet holes were found in into the car following the murder peltier fled the reservation in november 1975 an oregon state trooper stopped a recreational vehicle in which peltier was hiding peltier fired at the trooper and escaped coler the fbi agent who had been assassinated earlier on his revolver which was stolen when he was murdered was found in a paper bag under the front seat of the recreational vehicle peltiers thumb print was on that bag when arrested later in canada by the royal canadian mounted police peltier remarked that had he known the royal canadian mounted police officers were there to arrest him he would have blown them out of their shoes these are not the comments of an innocent man and they pottray the true character and the violent nature of leonard peltier in april 1977 a jury convicted peltier of themurders of those two fbi agents coler and williams a judge sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences while incarcerated in the lompoc california federal prison and with outside assistance peltier shot his way out of jail using a smuggled rifle to make his escape several days later after assaulting a rancher and stealing a pick up peltier was captured he was tried and convicted of escape and ofbeing a felon in possession of a firearm peltier has since appealed his various convictions numerous times each time the federal courts have upheld earlier legal decisions the united states supreme court has twice denied peltier review without comment the record is clear there were no new facts there are no new facts the old facts have not changed and peltier is guilty as charged i several times on national television peltier has admitted to firing at the two agents in his most recent public interview peltier has even reluctantly conceded what he had previously denied that he had in fact gone down to where the agents were executed still he openly states that he feels no guilt no remorse nor even any regret for the murders leonard peltier has lived a life of crime he has earned and deserves a lifetime of incarceration leonard peltier is a murderer without compassion or feeling towards his fellow man in turn he deserves no compassion mr president there is no justification for relieving leonard peltier from his punishment our judicial system has spoken in this case again again and again leonard peltier is a vicioug violent and cowardly criminal that hides behind legitimate native american issues leonard peltier was never a leader in the native american community he is simply a brute thug and murderer with no respect no regard for human life our citizens on and off the reservations must be protected from predators like peltier mr president since leonard peltier could not fool the federal courts he is now trying to fool you to fool the public he is shading and hiding the facts and playing on sympathy he and his advocates want to confuse the fact of his guilt with matters completely extraneous to that fact do not let him get away with it mr president sympathy is appropriate only for dead heroes and surviving families do not let their sacrifice be forgotten that was somewhat of a lengthy letter but as you can tell it is a subject that should be dear to every one of our hearts in this room to the heart of every american out there that believes in law and justice to every law enforcement family out there that currently has someone in law enfordement or has had a member of their family in law enforcement if we let if we let this kind of violent assassin out of prison after serving only 24 years it will in my opinion be a crippling blow to the message that we need to send to the law enforcement in this country that message really is fairly simple that is that you work as a law enforcement officer to provide as your duty peace and justice in our system and that when eace and justice are attacked in our system our system has a price it has a consequence it has a punishment it is the only way we can uphold the integrity of our system of law enforcement is to have a zero tolerance or a limited tolerance of any type of direct attack against our system of peace and justice the assassination of two federal bureau of investigation agents no matter how many years ago is a direct attack against the legal and justice process in this country i urge all my colleagues to join with me in attempting to be persuasive with the president of the united states and the american public in saying how important it is that this politicalcharade being put on by the defense attorneys for this convicted assassin that this kind of show be stopped that this kind of show be denied their goal their goal of course is to let this convicted assassin walk the streets of america again do not let him hide under the shield of being a native american that is a disgrace to the native americans do not pull native americans down to the level of this convicted killer do not affiliate this convicted killer with the native americans in this country that is an insult in my opinion if we do do not forget the facts of the case just so that i can remind the members let me go through the facts again in a little briefer form than the letter two fbi agents were assassinated they attempted to pursue a vehicle which contained this suspect at the time suspect now a convicted killer leonard peltier they were wounded they were disarmed by the wounds that they had in othef words they could not fight back they didnt have any weapons left to fight back with they were not physically capable one the fbi agents was unconscious the other fbi agent was rendering first aid to the unconscious fbi agent this convicted killer who by the way was a fugitive from justice for the attempted assassination of an offduty police officer in milwaukee walked up to these two fbi agents and executed them in cold blood he was later stopped in a recreational vehicle in that vehicle they found one of the deceased agents pistols in a paper bag that bag had evidence peltiers fingerprints on it peltier was captured in canada he was convicted of two counts of murder for these fbi agents he escaped from the federal prison do not let people tell us this guy is a nonviolent guy he was in federal prison and he shot his way out of federal prison think of the last time since the john dillinger days or bonnie and clyde and so on that somebody shot their way out of the federal prison that is who this individual is now today now today he is in front of the american people in front of the president of the united states asking for mercy look 25 years ago may seem like a long time to some but it has been a real long time for the families of those young fbi agents that were assassinated in cold blood in conclusion on this particular issue let me ask for members support in standing up strong for the law enforcement community of the country in standing up strong for the families and the agents and professionals of the federal bureau of investigation in standing up strong for the concept of peace and justice within the boundaries of our country let us all have our voice heard that in the united states of america if you assassinate a police officer or just as soon two federal bureau of investigation officers you will pay a price and we will stick with the punishment that we deal out we are not a bunch of patsies do not come back to us and think you are going to get a free walk 25 years later after that kind of action if we fail to do this if we fail to do this we are sending the wrong message out there and we are crippling justice and peace in our country i would like to do an update on a couple of other subjects this evening while i have the opportunity to visit with the members as members will recall about 2 or 3 weeks ago maybe a month ago there is a museum in new york city called the brooklyn art museum the brooklyn art museum it was discovered with taxpayer dollars with taxpayer dollars was sponsoring an art exhibit that depicted among other things a portrait of the virgin mary which is one of the holiest symbols of the catholic religion throughout the world and of christianity throughout the world this art museum was allowingin this art exhibit with taxpayer dollars this portrait of the virgin mary with elephant dung as they say crap as i say thrown all over the portrait can members imagine that how long do members think that type of art exhibit would have been tolerated or should have been tolerated in this country at taxpayer dollars if it was an exhibit of martin luther king for example or if it were an exhibit of an outstanding jewish rabbi for example or if it were an exhibit of some other outstanding leader that meant so much to a religious organization anywhere in this world they would not put up with that but for some reason there seems to be some justification out there by some people that an attack on christianity should be separated from an attack say on martin luther king or an attack on the image of a jewish rabbi and so on and so forth what happened is that the mayor of new york city mayor rudy giuliani i think had some guts he stood up and he said we are drawing the line that has gone too far there is a strong freedom of expression in this country there is a first amendment in this country but there is a balance that we have in this country just the same as under the freedom of speech we do not allow individuals to go into a theater and yell fire fire fire we do not allow that that is not a violation of your first amendment rights but we do not allow you to go into a theater and do that we draw a line this thing is not carte blanche this first amendment to do anything that you feel like doing especially when you do it with taxpayer dollars the mayor came under heavy criticism by the very elite that were dealing with the brooklyn art museum the board of directors who i think were acting very pompous in somehow defending this disgraceful work of art not a work of art that is just controversial that brings up lots of discussion but a work of art that hit at the very integrity of a large religious group throughout the world that was the maximum type of insult that you could throw at that particular religion and did it with ainerican taxpayer dollars why do i keep bringing up the fact of american taxpayer dollars because therein lies the distinction as to whether or not this is an issue under the first amendment of our constitution under our constitution frankly had the united states taxpayer dollars not been used to fund this portrait of the virgin mary of which dung was thrown all over it had taxpayer dollars not been used i am afraid to say that this would have been probably protected or would have been protected underthe first amendment we can tolerate that it is horrible and i cannot imagine for example why the first lady hillary clinton stood up for this thing she said however in her comments that while she would not go see it but she certainly stood up for the right to go around and exhibit this with taxpayer dollars iunderstand where some would say it is a first amendment right if there is not taxpayer dollars being used although i can tell the members that the press in this country and the liberal left in this country would not have stood for 2 seconds if it were martin luther king or a jewish rabbi or some other celebrated figure being treated in that fashion but the key here is taxpayer dollars 0 2320 the point here is very clear and i think the citizens of this country i think we need to go out and ask our constituents do the citizens of this country really think it is a justified and constitutionally protected right under the constitution to fund this kind of art with taxpayer dollars or should this type of art be denied the access of taxpayer dollars and allowed to be funded in society with private dollars remember that my objection tonight and the mayor of new york citys objection to this art was not that the art should iot be shown now it is disgraceful do not get me wrong i do not condone this kind of art but there is a constitutionally protected right to show this art without taxpayer dollars that argument has some legitimacy but that was not the debate that is being carried forward here what the mayor said what i said and mr speaker what i think most of our constituents believe is that this kind of art i e the virgin mary with dung splashed all over her with taxpayer dollars has gone over that line you draw a line you have gone over that line do not use taxpayer dollars the brooklyn art museum in new york they could easily fund this through other monies they just want to try and make an issue what they want to do is open that door so that taxpayers in this country will have to pay out of their hardearned dollars will have to use those taxpayer dollars to let the socalled art community especially the elite of the brooklyn art museum fund anything they would like no matter how offensive no matter how derogatory it is that is wrong this art museum knows that it is wrong well there has been a new step a new report to update you on and that is that a federal court judge this week actually came out and said that the art museum has a right to use taxpayer dollars to exhibit this type of art i e the virgin mary with dung thrown all over her in very obviously a disgraceful fashion intended to be as derogatory as possible not only towards christianity but towards one of the most important symbols of christianity i am telling you federal judge you made a mistake you are wrong there is not a constitutionally protected provision that says you can use taxpayer dollars in this country to fund that kind of art why do you not use some common sense why do you have to offend the people of christianity why do you do an allout attack you would not do it with martin luther king and the black community you would not do it in the jewish community with some rabbi of theirs you would not do it with some other type of religious entity or important entity in this country with their leader why are you doing this why do you decide to use taxpayer dollars to offend every christian in the world it is wrong you have got a temporary victory from this federal judge but in the end i think the mayor of new york city one had a lot of guts to do what he did and number two i think he is going to prevail i also think that the general opinion in this country is look that kind of art as violent and as horrible and as disgraceful as it is is protected but not with the use of taxpayer dollars our constituents i do not believe are in any way about to buy the argument that we ought to take the tax dollars out of their paycheck every week and put a percentage of that towards the funding of this kind of art"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "absolutely our

percent in some needy or poorer school districts but for that small relatively small portion of federal funds that make up an overall classroom budget the strings and the red tape and the requirements and mandates attached to that minority of cash is overpowering there are school districts in my state that have to hire people just to fill out the federal paperwork so that they can get the money

required for a motion to instruct to be in order and it has to deal with funding obviously in this motion to instruct it says that in resolving the differences between the two houses on the funding level for program management of the social security act so it meets that test level but then it goes on to say that through the funding mechanism they are supposed to choose a level that reflects a requirement on medicare choice organizations to offer a minimum contract period of 3 years there is no funding mechanism that would require or even allow a 3year contract under medicare medicare choice programs are funded for 1 year under the health care financing administration the amount that a medicare choice program receives is based upon a number of factors where it is located the cost of medical services in the area and most importantly the makeup of the beneficiaries that have signed up for that medicare choice program that is what is their age what is their medical condition all of these factors are taken into consideration when the level of reimbursement to the medicare choice plan is determined the difference by the medicare choice program of offering the statutory mandatory benefits is what the health care financing administration has determined to be its payment level if there are dollar differences between those two areas by law that plan must either offer additional benefits or that money has to be refunded back to the health care financing administration but it can only be done on a 1year basis under current law beneficiaries can sign up for a medicare choice program and leave the program that is the patient profile of a plan can change from year to year to year so it is nonsensical to think that a level of funding can produce a 3year contract it is also nonsensical to think that it can produce a set benefit package for a 3year period one of the reasons some of these plans are pulling out of areas is because they can no longer offer the benefits they had offered under their shrinking profit structure dictated and determined by the health care financing administration so make no mistake not only does this motion to instruct have no legal binding requirement but it is nonsensical it is germane it does affect the funding level but in no way does just affecting the funding level bring about any ability to create a 3year

recently in the kansas city star i would like to read some excerpts of that editorial because as far as i am concerned they got the debate exactly right i read and i quote in 1996 congress ordered the administration to simplify the pricing of milk that is easy enough stop regulating it but this is the farm sector and a free market in milk is somehow inconceivable instead milk prices are calculated from rules and equations filling several volumes of the code of federal regulations the administrations proposed reform would reduce the number of regions for which the price of wholesale milk is regulated from 33 to 11 fine but it would also perpetuate the loopy depressionera notion that the price of milk should in some respects be based in part on its distance from eau claire wisconsin under current policy producers farther away from this supposed heart of the dairy region generally receive higher premiums or differentials the administration called for slightly lower differentials for beverage milk in many regions but in congress even this minuscule step towards rationality is being swept aside the committee on agriculture has substituted a measure that essentially maintains a status quo similar moves are afoot in the senate worse some dairy supporters are working to reauthorize and expand the northeast interstate dairy compact a regional milk cartel and allow similar grouping for southern states missouris legislature by the way has already voted to join the southern compact even though it would result in higher prices for consumers the consumer federation of america reports that the northeast dairy compact raised retail milk prices by an average of 15 cents a gallon over 2 years dairy producers concerned about the long view should be worried critics point out that the higher milk differentials endorsed by the house committee on agriculture may well lead to lower revenue for many producers this is because the higher prices will encourage more production driving down the base milk price and negating the higher differential the worst idea in this developing stew is the prospect for dairycompact proliferation a compact works like an internal tariff because the cartel prohibits sales above an agreedupon floor price producers within the region are protected from wouldbe outside competitors opponents point out that more regional compacts and the higher prices they support will breed excessive production creating dairy surpluses that will be dumped into markets of other regions this will prompt other states to demand similar protection promoting the spread of dairy compacts ultimately as in the 1980s political pressure will build to liquidate the dairy surplus in a huge multibillion dollar buyout of cheese milk powder and even entire herds congress should permit the northeast compact to sunset or expire which will occur if the lawmakers simply do nothing in fact doing nothing to the administrations proposal seems to be the best choice in this case or more properly the least bad perhaps some day washington will debate real price simplification as in ditching dairy socialism and letting prices fluctuate according to the law of supply and demand closed quote the kansas city star is right we should allow secretary glickmans modest reforms to go forward we should sunset the dairy compact markets are more powerful than armies they allow the market to set the price of milk in moscow maybe we should try it right here in washington d c"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today americans celebrate national teacher day a day set aside to

for them they argue that norwooddingell would force managed care plans to practice defensive medicine that would increase their costs and cause them to raise our premiums this argument is ridiculous and actually underlines the need for reform norwooddingell specifically provides that plans are not required to cover any services beyond those provided in the contract so with the liability provision in place costs of care should not increase significantly as these costs are already covered by premiums care is being paid for but not provided legal accountability will give hmos the incentive to

recognition of a particular part of that educational establishment that is not often recognized and it was brought to my attention again although i have long been aware of its existence but it was brought to my attention again by a card i received in the mail not too long ago here it 1s a little handwritten handdrawn and coloredin star here it says thank you thank you thank you it goes all the way around thank you very much it is from a young man named jerrod padinama it says dear mr tancredo thank you for giving us the privilege of home schooling my home school coop is studying the constitution and it is fun i am 9 years old i am in the third grade i am praying for you jerrod padinama well jerrod thank you for your prayers i sincerely appreciate them but i tell my colleagues this is really a very touching little card i received and i have been holding on to it because i wanted to reference it in a way the neat part is that this young man would take the time to send me this little card and draw it in but in a way it is a sad commentary because he has to tell me thank you for letting me be home schooled and he does know intuitively i suppose and certainly his parents are well aware of the fact that often there are attempts in this body and certainly in legislatures all over the country and states all over the nation to actually restrict the ability of parents to actually teach their children at home and they have to say thank you to us for letting them have a right that frankly is as natural as breathing a right of a parent to teach their child at home this is as if this is a strange anomaly this is something weird that we do in this country that they have to be allowed to do by the legislature and that is the only kind of negative part of this thing i see because otherwise it is a very beautiful thing i just wanted to point out that home schooling certainly preceded any other kind of schooling we had in the united states of america and it did very very well and it continues to do very very well and it is an expanding phenomena many many people are participating in this it is growing astronomically almost beyond really ways to describe it i find in my own state of colorado that there are thousands and thousands of parents who are taking on the responsibility of teaching their children at home recently i received a copy of an article that was written by a gentleman by the name of steven archer and he details a study that was just done by larry rudner who is the leading statistician at the university of maryland he studied home schoolers and what it comes down to is this he said regarding the results of this research rudner said the bottom line of the study is that the 20 000 homeschool students i studied were doing extremely well in terms of their scores on the iowa test of basic skills in fact the median test scores for homeschooled children who participated in this study were in the 75th and 85th percentile range this is exceptional compared to the national average which by definition is the 50th percentile based on the performance of children in the public schools which rudner explained deviates little from that value home schoolers also did significantly better than their private school counterparts based on catholic school norms where the median scaled scores were in the 65th to 75th percentile range according to rudner major findings in the study include the following almost onequarter of homeschool students are enrolled one or more grades above their agelevel peers in public and private schools it goes on but i would just say that it verifies what we already know about home schooling and that is that it works it works in an academic sense it works in a social sense and i want to take the

money that goes to the united states treasury a tax on our money in circulation there is a simple and inexpensive way to convert this costly illogical convoluted system to a logical system which pays

leonard peltier mr peltier is currently in the penitentiary federal penitentiary for the assassination of two fbi agents he has been in prison for 25 years i need to be fair to all of my colleagues here and give you some disclosures first of all i used to be a police officer as a result of being a police officer over the years and especially during the time of my tenure as a police officer i developed a very close relationship with agents of the federal bu reau of investigation over the years i have also developed a great deal of respect for the federal bureau of investigation but i must also tell my colleagues that over these years i have also had an opportunity to carefully scrutinize the federal bureau of investigation because you see i think it is a very important agency for our country but i think the integrity of the agency is also very very important in the past i have been very critical of the federal bureau of investigation when they messed up i can give you an excellent example ruby ridge the agents involved at ruby ridge in my opinion should have been immediately terminated what happened at ruby ridge i will not repeat this evening but i will tell you that the command officer from the federal bureau of investigation was not terminated in fact the command officer was put on a paid leave of absence for 1 or 2 years and retired and received in my opinion no punishment at all i am also looking with a very careful eye at the federal bureau of investigations role at the waco texas goofup that too is a very tragic situation in the history of our country and i think unfortunately there will be revealed within the report about the incident at waco texas that the federal bureau of investigation misstated their role understated their contribution so to speak or their involveient in the situation at waco texas so i am not necessarily in lockstep with the federal bureau of investigation but i can tell you when i look at all of the law enforcement agencies i have seen over the years and as a former law enforcement officer i have had the opportunity to be involved with many of them at the very highest when you look at the picture as an average the federal bureau of investigation comes out at the very top and i think it isi incumbent colleagues of every one of us when we see an attack launched against the federal bureau of investigation that is launched without justification or when we see an action being taken against the federal bureau of investigation without justification we have a commitment to step forward and say something about it as i mentioned at the beginning of my comments i saw an article the other day about this individual this gentlemans name is leonard peltier i saw today in fact an article in the usa today the article is indians fbi face off in washington first of all i am not sure why the author of the usa today article uses the word indians in a broad or general descriptive form in imy particular district which is the third congressional district of the state of colorado we have the indian tribal lands and i have yet to hear from any of the leaders of those indian tribes of which i work with very closely on projects such as the animus laplata the kind of appeal that may be suggested by all indians as a result of this particular article it is my opinion that the native american involvement in this case is limited and it is also my opinionthat if you sit down with the average native american in this country and you look at the facts of this case that there will be very few native americans who would step forward and say that this particular convict is a political prisoner i think this is a stage being set by the defense attorneys for this convict actually using the word convict is somewhat gentle he is not a convict he is a murderer and he is a coldblooded murderer he killed two fbi agents in cold blood now 25 years ago as one defense attorney would suggest is something that enough time has passed by that perhaps he has served his time for this violent and horrible crime i will quote exactly from the usa today peltier that is the convict the murderer that i am talking about has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in attorney carl nadler says can you believe this let me repeat what this defense attorney says peltier has been in prison as long as anyone responsible for similar crimes should be in prison what he is suggesting is that 25 years is enough time for somebody to serve that goes out and in cold blood assassinates two officers of the federal bureau of investigation well r stand here tonight colleagues in deep disagreement with this defense attorney and i urge that all of my colleagues on the floor take time to review what is going on in the month of november in regard to this case now why have i suggested the month of november well apparently this murderers defense team has put together a little political show and tell and they call november the month of publicity or the month to get reprieve for this convicted murderer what i mean by that it is this month that they are submitting papers to the president of the united states request ing that clemency be granted to leonard peltier a convicted murderer a couple of days ago i read an open letter this open letter is a joint letter authored by the federal bureau of investigation agents association located in new rochelle new york and the society of former special agents of the federal bureau of investigation located in quantico virginia the above organizations which are professional nongovernmental associations rep resent over 20 000 active duty and former fbi agents i was so moved by this letter that i ask my colleagues to follow me closely this evening as i read verbatim that open letter to the american people as many of you know i do not often read from notes when i speak from this podium but i am going to be very careful this evening that i read this letter verbatim because i think it is important that every one of us in this room have a clear understahding of the facts of this case before peltiers defense attorney arrives here in washington d c sets up this political show and tell and tries to convince through propaganda that for some reason this convicted murderer deserves clemency from the president of the united states we should not take this lightly we had a very difficult situation about 1 month ago when clemency was given to the puerto rican terrorists as i pointed out from this house floor you can look right up in the roof of this fine room and you can see the bullet hole or i could walk over here to this desk drawer and show you the bullet holes through that desk from the puerto rican terrorists who entered this floor many

peltier a violent man with a violent past he was a fugitive wanted for attempted murder of an off duty milwaukee police officer knowing that the two vehicles pursuing him were occupied by fbi agents and believing they were seeking t arresthim on that attempted murder case peltier and his associates abruptly stopped their vehicle and began firing rifles at the agents surprised by the sudden violence outmanned outgunned and at an extreme tactical disadvantage coler and williams were both wounded and defenseless within minutes coler sustained a severe wound the force of the bullet nearly tearing his right arm off williams wounded in the left shoulder and the right foot removed his shirt during the hail of incoming rifle fire and fashioned a tourniquet around the arm ofcoler who had by then fallen unconscious agents coler and williams were then at the mercy of leonard peltier and his associates but there was to be no mercy for these fine young law enforcement officers not satisfied with the terrible injuries that they had inflicted peltier and the two other men walked down the hill towards the ambushed agents three shots were fired from peltiers rifle williams kneeling and apparently surrendering was shot in the face directly through his out extended shielding handled he died instantly coler who was still unconscious was shot twice in the head at closerange he died instantly from those shots the crime scene examination testified to the brutality of the ambush coler and williams had little chance to defend themselves they had fired only five shots in contrast over 125 bullet holes were found in into the car following the murder peltier fled the reservation in november 1975 an oregon state trooper stopped a recreational vehicle in which peltier was hiding peltier fired at the trooper and escaped coler the fbi agent who had been assassinated earlier on his revolver which was stolen when he was murdered was found in a paper bag under the front seat of the recreational vehicle peltiers thumb print was on that bag when arrested later in canada by the royal canadian mounted police peltier remarked that had he known the royal canadian mounted police officers were there to arrest him he would have blown them out of their shoes these are not the comments of an innocent man and they pottray the true character and the violent nature of leonard

peltier was captured he was tried and convicted of escape and ofbeing a felon in possession of a firearm peltier has since appealed his various convictions numerous times each time the federal courts have upheld earlier legal decisions the united states supreme court has twice denied peltier review without comment the record is clear there were no new facts there are no new facts the old facts have not changed and peltier is guilty as charged i several times on national television peltier has admitted to firing at the two agents in his most recent public interview peltier has even reluctantly conceded what he had previously denied that he had in fact gone down to where the agents were executed still he openly states that he feels no guilt no remorse nor even any regret for the murders leonard peltier has lived a life of crime he has earned and deserves a lifetime of incarceration leonard peltier is a murderer without compassion or feeling towards his fellow man in turn he deserves no compassion mr president there is no justification for relieving leonard peltier from his punishment our judicial system has spoken in this case again again and again leonard peltier is a vicioug violent and cowardly criminal that hides behind legitimate native american issues leonard peltier was never a leader in the native american community he is simply a brute thug and murderer with no respect no regard for human life our citizens on and off the reservations must be protected from predators like peltier mr president since leonard peltier could not fool the federal courts he is now trying to fool you to fool the public he is shading and hiding the facts and playing on sympathy he and his advocates want to confuse the fact of his guilt with matters completely extraneous to that fact do not let him get away with it mr president sympathy is appropriate only for dead heroes and surviving families do not let their sacrifice be forgotten that was somewhat of a lengthy letter but as you can tell it is a subject that should be dear to every one of our hearts in this room to the heart of every american out there that believes in law and justice to every law enforcement family out there that currently has someone in law enfordement or has had a member of their family in law enforcement if we let if we let this kind of violent assassin out of prison after serving only 24 years it will in my opinion be a crippling blow to the message that we need to send to the law enforcement in this country that message really is fairly simple that is that you work as a law enforcement officer to provide as your duty peace and justice in our system and that when eace and justice are attacked in our system our system has a price it has a consequence it has a punishment it is the only way we can uphold the integrity of our system of law enforcement is to have a zero tolerance or a limited tolerance of any type of direct attack against our system of peace and justice the assassination of two federal bureau of investigation agents no matter how many years ago is a direct attack against the legal and justice process in this country i urge all my colleagues to join with me in attempting to be persuasive with the president of the united states and the american public in saying how important it is that this politicalcharade being put on by the defense attorneys for this convicted assassin that this kind of show be stopped that this kind of show be denied their goal their goal of course is to let this convicted assassin walk the streets of america again do not let him hide under the shield of being a native american that is a disgrace to the native americans do not pull native americans down to the level of this convicted killer do not affiliate this convicted killer with the native americans in this country that is an insult in my opinion if we do do not forget the facts of the case just so that i can remind the members let me go through the facts again in a little briefer form than the letter two fbi agents were assassinated they attempted to pursue a vehicle which contained this suspect at the time suspect now a convicted killer leonard peltier they were wounded they were disarmed by the wounds that they had in othef words they could not fight back they didnt have any weapons left to fight back with they were not physically capable one the fbi agents was unconscious the other fbi agent was rendering first aid to the unconscious fbi agent this convicted killer who by the way was a fugitive from justice for the attempted assassination of an offduty police officer in milwaukee walked up to these two fbi agents and executed them in cold blood he was later stopped in a recreational vehicle in that vehicle they found one of the deceased agents pistols in a paper bag that bag had evidence peltiers fingerprints on it peltier was captured in canada he was convicted of two counts of murder for these fbi agents he escaped from the federal prison do not let people tell us this guy is a nonviolent guy he was in federal prison and he shot his way out of federal prison think of the last time since the john dillinger days or bonnie and clyde and so on that somebody shot their way out of the federal prison that is who this individual is now today now today he is in front of the american people in front of the president of the united states asking for mercy look 25 years ago may seem like a long time to some but it has been a real long time for the families of those young fbi agents that were assassinated in cold blood in conclusion on this particular issue let me ask for members support in standing up strong for the law enforcement community of the country in standing up strong for the families and the agents and professionals of the federal bureau of investigation in standing up strong for the concept of peace and justice within the boundaries of our country let us all have our voice heard that in the united states of america if you assassinate a police officer or just as soon two federal bureau of investigation officers you will pay a price and we will stick with the punishment that we deal out we are not a bunch of patsies do not come back to us and think you are going to get a free walk 25 years later after that kind of action if we fail to do this if we fail to do this we are sending the wrong message out there and we are crippling justice and peace in our country i would like to do an update on a couple of other subjects this evening while i have the opportunity to visit with the members as members will recall about 2 or 3 weeks ago maybe a month ago there is a museum in new york city called the brooklyn art museum the brooklyn art museum it was discovered with taxpayer dollars with taxpayer dollars was sponsoring an art exhibit that depicted among other things a portrait of the virgin mary which is one of the holiest symbols of the catholic religion throughout the world and of christianity throughout the world this art museum was allowingin this art exhibit with taxpayer dollars this portrait of the virgin mary with elephant dung as they say crap as i say thrown all over the portrait can members imagine that how long do members think that type of art exhibit would have been tolerated or should have been tolerated in this country at taxpayer dollars if it was an exhibit of martin luther king for example or if it were an exhibit of an outstanding jewish rabbi for example or if it were an exhibit of some other outstanding leader that meant so much to a religious organization anywhere in this world they would not put up with that but for some reason there seems to be some justification out there by some people that an attack on christianity should be separated from an attack say on martin luther king or an attack on the image of a jewish rabbi and so on and so forth what happened is that the mayor of new york city mayor rudy giuliani i think had some guts he stood up and he said we are drawing the line that has gone too far there is a strong freedom of expression in this country there is a first amendment in this country but there is a balance that we have in this country just the same as under the freedom of speech we do not allow individuals to go into a theater and yell fire fire fire we do not allow that that is not a violation of your first amendment rights but we do not allow you to go into a theater and do that we draw a line this thing is not carte blanche this first amendment to do anything that you feel like doing especially when you do it with taxpayer dollars the mayor came under heavy criticism by the very elite that were dealing with the brooklyn art museum the board of directors who i think were acting very pompous in somehow defending this disgraceful work of art not a work of art that is just controversial that brings up lots of discussion but a work of art that hit at the very integrity of a large religious group throughout the world that was the maximum type of insult that you could throw at that particular religion and did it with ainerican taxpayer dollars why do i keep bringing up the fact of american taxpayer dollars because therein lies the distinction as to whether or not this is an issue under the first amendment of our constitution under our constitution frankly had the united states taxpayer dollars not been used to fund this portrait of the virgin mary of which dung was thrown all over it had taxpayer dollars not been used i am afraid to say that this would have been probably protected or would have been protected underthe first amendment we can tolerate that it is horrible and i cannot imagine for example why the first lady hillary clinton stood up for this thing she said however in her comments that while she would not go see it but she certainly stood up for the right to go around and exhibit this with taxpayer dollars iunderstand where some would say it is a first amendment right if there is not taxpayer dollars being used although i can tell the members that the press in this country and the liberal left in this country would not have stood for 2 seconds if it were martin luther king or a jewish rabbi or some other celebrated figure being treated in that fashion but the key here is taxpayer dollars 0 2320 the point here is very clear and i think the citizens of this country i think we need to go out and ask our constituents do the citizens of this country really think it is a justified and constitutionally protected right under the constitution to fund this kind of art with taxpayer dollars or should this type of art be denied the access of taxpayer dollars and allowed to be funded in society with private dollars remember that my objection tonight and the mayor of new york citys objection to this art was not that the art should iot be shown now it is disgraceful do not get me wrong i do not condone this kind of art but there is a constitutionally protected right to show this art without taxpayer dollars that argument has some legitimacy but that was not the debate that is being carried forward here what the mayor said what i said and mr speaker what i think most of our constituents believe is that this kind of art i e the virgin mary with dung splashed all over her with taxpayer dollars has gone over that line you draw a line you have gone over that line do not use taxpayer dollars the brooklyn art museum in new york they could easily fund this through other monies they just want to try and make an issue what they want to do is open that door so that taxpayers in this country will have to pay out of their hardearned dollars will have to use those taxpayer dollars to let the socalled art community especially the elite of the brooklyn art museum fund anything they would like no matter how offensive no matter how derogatory it is that is wrong this art museum knows that it is wrong well there has been a new step a new report to update you on and that is that a federal court judge this week actually came out and said that the art museum has a right to use taxpayer dollars to exhibit this type of art i e the virgin mary with dung thrown all over her in very obviously a disgraceful fashion intended to be as derogatory as possible not only towards christianity but towards one of the most important symbols of christianity i am telling you federal judge you made a mistake you are wrong there is not a constitutionally protected provision that says you can use taxpayer dollars in this country to fund that kind of art why do you not use some common sense why do you have to offend the people of christianity why do you do an allout attack you would not do it with martin luther king and the black community you would not do it in the jewish community with some rabbi of theirs you would not do it with some other type of religious entity or important entity in this country with their leader why are you doing this why do you decide to use taxpayer dollars to offend every christian in the world it is wrong you have got a temporary victory from this federal judge but in the end i think the mayor of new york city one had a lot of guts to do what he did and number two i think he is going to prevail i also think that the general opinion in this country is look that kind of art as violent and as horrible and as disgraceful as it is is protected but not with the use of taxpayer dollars our constituents i do not believe are in any way about to buy the argument that we ought to take the tax dollars out of their paycheck every week and put a percentage of that towards the funding of this kind of art"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "absolutely our governor governor bill owens is one who is looking forward to a day when there is greater flexibility to allow not only him but the rest of the colorado general assembly and not to mention our school board leaders who are elected officials accountable directly to the people these are the folks where they actually know the names of the students and the teachers and the administrators all of these folks are looking forward to the day when they will be unleashed from the federal rules and regulations that hamper their ability to teach children in an effective way we spend billions of dollars here in washington and yet for the billions we spend the actual proportion of federal funds that actually reach a classroom is relatively small somewhere on the order of 7 6 sometimes as high as 9 percent in some needy or poorer school districts but for that small relatively small portion of federal funds that make up an overall classroom budget the strings and the red tape and the requirements and mandates attached to that minority of cash is overpowering there are school districts in my state that have to hire people just to fill out the federal paperwork so that they can get the money this is money that comes to washington the american taxpayers are working hard every day and paying their taxes the money comes here to washington d c the congress then through its formulas and so on divvies up this cash in a variety of ways and then there is this huge bureaucracy not too far from where we are now that then goes to work on this money by the time that cash makes its way back to colorado and back to the state of georgia and every other state in the union there is just a fraction left for the kids that is what our straight as proposal is designed to resolve not to spend more money in washington we do not need to do that we can actually increase the proportion of dollars that make it to a child by cutting all these silly rules and regulations i know there are people over there in the department of education who are nervous about this discussion nervous about the debate and they oppose straight as and with good reason our goal is to get rid of a lot of those people i will be candid and frank with the gentleman and with them and with the american people i frankly care more about ffiy children in public schools and all of the children of my friends and neighbors back in colorado than i do about these people down the street here in the department of education i want the money to get to the kids and to the teachers who know how to teach rather than the bureaucrats who know how to provide paperwork and produce more headaches for communities around the country this straight as proposal it is a big thing there are 760 federal education programs the edflex bill that we passed dealt with i think 9 of them 9 significant ones it was a big step in the right direction to follow up to take the next logical step to show the american people that we are serious about moving authority out of washington and empowering our local communities this straight as proposal is a significant one i might add that we have almost 100 cosponsors now in this congress including on our side of the aisle the republican side every member of that committee is on board every member of our republican leadership is on board it is a bipartisan bill we have democrats who are cosponsors of straight as this is a big initiative and an exciting one and the gentleman is right before i turn it back over to the gentleman to suggest that the education leaders in my state and i would bet in the state of the gentleman

committee on the budget i rise to support house concurrent resolution 68 our budget plan is the first ever to lock up 100 percent of social security payroll taxes and interest for the future this is historic because over 10 years the federal budget has been taking social security funds to pay for other spending programs in the year 2000 the gop sets aside 137 billion that is 100 percent of social security monies for social security the president pledges 62 percent of that that is 85 billion and 52 billion of social security money spent for other programs between the years 2000 and 2009 we set aside 1 8 trillion for social security and medicare the presidents budget sets aside 1 3 trillion for social security and earmarks about 345 billion for medicare that is 1 645 trillion over 100 billion less than our budget no matter how we add it up 137 billion is more than 85 billion no matter how we add it up 1 8 trillion is more than 1 645 trillion two plus two does equal four some on the other side who are using projections on the presidents budget will save over 15 years compared to our budget over 10 years that as the saying goes two plus two does equal five no matter how you look at it we are saving more for social security and medicare than the presidents budget saves over 10 years the president is not only missinginaction on medicare reform he cuts medicare by 11 9 billion he is using a very strange strategy for claiming the high ground on medicare one he cuts billions from medicare two he saves less than republicans for medicare three he singlehandedly stops bipartisan medicare reform from the medicare commission four he leaves us with the status quo five he then claims to be the champion of medicare if we look at the facts we know that the committee on the budget

individuals in our communities and i find it a fitting tribute that this program will be named after him we all realize that to succeed in todays society every person must be able to read and write it is unacceptable that in a country as advanced as ours that we have millions of people who cannot read or write h r 3222 helps to address this issue in several ways first it would improve the quality of even start and other family literacy programs in several areas it would provide training and technical assistance to local providers while at the same time assuring that the level of assistance does not decrease it also requires that instructional programs are based on scientifically researched methods of teaching reading and provides funding for research on teaching of reading to adults in family literacy programs finally it establishes qualifications for instructional staff in even start programs whose salaries are paid with even start dollars additionally h r 3222 provides for charitable choice by allowing government to consider religious organizations as part of eligible partnerships on the same basis as other groups receiving funding our churches synagogues mosques and other religious organizations have a long tradition of helping those in need in our country including helping those who cannot read this legislation helps them to carry on with that tradition in
