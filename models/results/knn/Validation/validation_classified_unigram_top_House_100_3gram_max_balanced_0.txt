increasing procedural abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer amendments and resolutions waiving all the standing rules of the house however there are some other problems affecting the rules committee which have received far less attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call of emergency meetings will be restricted to real emergencies aside from its emergency designation there is nothing unusual about the provisions of this rule it waives points of order against the bill for lack of authorization and because there are legislative provisions in this appropriation bill it also waives points of order to protect an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania providing for a drugfree workplace this is a longer version of the walker amendment which is technically legislation on an appropriation bill there has been particular interest in a legislative paragraph in this bill which provides for a 4percent pay increase for all federal employees including members of congress that language is legislation on an appropriation bill but it is protected from a point of order by the provisions of this rule however there is nothing in this rule which restricts the

at that time i now would like to do as my special order a continuation of the different ones i have been speaking on concerning the japanese lobby today i have an interesting article as the members know for some time i have been reading from the book called the japanese conspiracy by marvin wolf which outlines the method that japan has used to target our indistries and of course there have been some questions as to whether mr wolf was accurate or whether he was not i was very happy when on sunday we found an article by a liberal columnist named richard reeves in the baltimore sun it was actually on august 9 he stated essentially what marvin wolf has claimed in his book the article is entitled the japan lobby and it explains how the japanese have cheated on their quotas with the british and how upset the british are with their behavior i will now read it it is datelined new york by richard reeves and it says you can buy a jeep with righthand drive at suzuki dealers in holland which seems strange because dutch cars have their steering wheels on the left the dutch drive the same way we do on the right side of the road he says it is the british who keep to the left and so need steering wheels on the right and in fact those dutch suzukis with englishlanguage dashboards and owners manuals are made and sold for the british market mr reeves points out the whole thing is a way one of many for japanese manufacturers to cheat on a court arrangement backed by the governments of great britain and japan this is how mr reeves says it works the japanese government and auto companies have agreed to restrict their exports to 11 percent of the british marketwhich is about 220 000 cars a year but when that quota has been met japanese ear dealers begin sending customers employees and relatives across the english channel to rotterdam to pick up the righthand drive cars there and bring them back to england as used cars such tricksand that is the word mr reeves usesaccording to auto experts in london actually give the japanese 16 percent or more of the british market it has got to stop said anthony beaumontdark a conservative member of parliament whose district happes to include a land rover factory of course land rover produces vehicles fourwheeled vehicles these people see rules the conservative member says as something to get around rather than something to abide by mr reeves continues to write saying things like that at least in the united states leaves one open to charges of japan bashing a civil disorder that some would equate with racism or antieemitism i would suspect though that mr beaumontdark might be just as upset if he thought the swedes or norwegians were the ones threatening the jobs of his constituents japan bashing in the united states mr reeves says and he says which he thinks isa healthy indication that americans can still read and write and count has created an equal and opposite counterforce a japan lobby that lobbysecond now only to the israel lobby which seems to have been an inspiration to the japanesewas built and is supported by the pennies of hundreds of thousands of americans working for japan inc from toyota dealers to lumberjacks cutting trees in oregon to make chopsticks in tokyo and i might just point out at this juncture in this article that we have created 106 000 more jobs in japan than they have in the united states and that is according to harpers index mr reeves says that if a congressman or columnist says that maybe we should take a look at whats happening and whether its good for all of us a reassuring face appears on television to say we dont understand free trade or something equally sacred it could be elliot richardsonelliot richardson according to business week is now chairman of the 25 million hitachi foundation which is the largest japanese foundation in the united states and hitachi is also setting up community action committees our information says mr reeves again says it could be elliot richardson or walter mondale or jim jones the former chairman of the house finance committeeall now working for or representing japanese or other foreign companies more than 100 former federal officeholders are among the hundreds and hundreds of americans now lobbying for foreign companies usually japanese the writer continues one of their great successes has been to help defeat legislation allowing the federal government to begin monitoring foreign investment in american propertiesa thing the japanese government does routinely we would not let it happen here because we said everybody would take their money and go home i think we should have given it a chance that number and others come from the research of pat choate a vice president of trw who is writing a book on foreign impact on the unitedstates economy and who also reports that 152 japanese companies and government agencies paid 100 million last year to 113 washington law firms and publicrelations agencies for lobbying in washington i placed that list in the congressional record on june 23 the japan lobby is in fact a growth industry according to mr reeves the association of foreign investors in america and that is the one represented by mr richardson and the association of foreign investors in real estate were both formed just this year reeves said that my own japanbashing credentials are i think in order even though i believe in free and fair trade its that i dont see japan practicing free trade or considering fairness at all i think in fact that japans willful selfinterested abuses of the spirit and letter of international trade agreements and systemsthe complaint of mr beanumontdark in englandcould destroy those systems if other major traders begin to play the game the japanese way continuing with mr reeves he said i said something like that to a japanese ambassador to a major industrial country a few weeks ago and he said in sadness not anger you have to understand that we cannot allow ourselves to be pushed too far on these matters and we cannot push our people too far because we are potentially a socially unstable country i say nonsense to that attitude because japan is a very strong aggressive country it is certainly the largest economic power in the world now mr reeves said what about us do you think america and americans can be pushed too far the japanese ambassador responded no you are flexible enough to take anything mr reeves concluded with his comment that the ambassador may have intended a compliment but that he mr reeves took it as a misjudgment that may cost both of us greatly the conclusion of this article is certainly most interesting to me i was surprised that a japanese ambassador would tell mr reeves thatyou have to understand that we cannot allow ourselves to be pushed too far on these matters and we cannot push our people too far because we are potentially a socially unstable country what does this mean to us does it call into question the reliability of their intentions as a friend it is a basic tenet of american life that we may argue with our friends over polltics and principle but you are still my friend we learn very early as youngsters the ground rules for friendship and not to step over a line because it would be an affront to a friend in fact anyone involved in politics has learned this lesson well and cherishes the individuality of our friends and our constituents this remark of the ambassadors is putting the burden of the relationship on the united states when he was asked do you think america and americans can be pushed too far he replied no you are flexible enough to take anything there is something that should be understood about the americans we are flexible but we will not take everything one of the outstanding features of being an american and living under this great constitution and prizing freedom the way we do is that americans have a sense of fair play i had a friend who succinctly expressed what fair play means to us she said americans are essentially free spirits because they prize freedom to protect it when youve cut their options they turn hostile the ambassador should know what we all understand we do not take everything off of everybody friendship is a twoway street when it becomes a real burden to us then difficulties begin i am including the article by mr

implementation of foreign policy i think its time congress also reminds itself that the administration plays a key role in domestic policy as much as we need a housing bill this year the current version of h r 4 is not the answer because it will not be enacted into law the cold hard fact is that h r 4 will be vetoed by the president the administration has identified several major problems with h r 4 10 of which will automatically trigger veto recommendations by the presidents advisors and this is not a bill that has bipartisan support it passed the committee on a vote divided entirely by party lines i commend the housing subcommittee chairman for his diligent work on housing programs but i am left wondering why a more balanced bill could not be produced if this years housing bill is vetoed the failure to enact freestanding housing legislation will extend over 6 years this is bad for those dependent on housing programs and it adversely affects the housing industry which provides our nations housing it also calls into question our entire committee system authorizing committees should not consistently be in a position of effectively allowing the appropriation committees to set funding priorities yet this is exactly what has taken place in the last few years i do not wish to excuse the administrations conduct in my view the administrations budget for housing programs in 1988 is very inadequate the administrations budget was overly harsh on community development and public housing programs which are serving their intended purpose it would be counterproductive and unfair to cut deeply into these programs many of which have already taken their fair share of reductions both in decreased appropriations over the last few years and through grammrudman budget cuts i am supporting a reasonable balanced and effective housing alternative being offered by the ranking minority member of the banking committee and i urge my colleagues to do likewise while costing less the alternative housing proposal will be able to serve more of the needy one reason for this is because it authorizes costeffective housing vouchers for up to 60 000 new units vouchers are a viable option in many communities and hud should be able to use them on a permanent and extensive basis unfortunately h r 4 does not authorize a single new voucher this is unfair to those who need housing and who would appreciate the opportunity and flexibility to choose their own dwelling in the neighborhood that they desire the alternative also places a greater emphasis on modernizing and rehabilitation of our existing housing stock much of which is seriously deteriorated rather than on constructing new projects the alternative avoids the micromanagement provisions of h r 4 which impose burdensome administrative restrictions on the implementation of current housing programs the alternative meets todays budget requirements by costing only 14 2 billion as compared to the 16 billion found in h r 4 this amount is still much greater than the administrations proposal of 11 3 billion the alternative preserve several important programs including community development block grants and urban development action grants rural housing programs are also preserved in addition the mortgage insurance and secondary market programs which have helped many households of average means become owners rather than renters are continued and improved the fha mortgage insurance program is authorized permanently anyone who recalls the multiple times this program expired last year creating chaos for prospective homebuyers will appreciate this provision user fees on secondary mortgage market initiatives are prohibited and the current fha mortgage insurance premium is maintained the wylieroukema substitute is a viable substitute to h r 4 if you want a housing bill one that the president will sign one that can become the law of the land a law that can shelter the needy and benefit our communities then i urge your support of wylieroukema"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "what is going to happen if we turn our backs on the niacaraguan resistance the small amount of aid we are debating today is of tremendous importance as we look to the future the security of this hemisphere and the material and spiritual wellbeing of nicaraguans is hanging in the balance if we do not stand foursquare in support of peace with freedom and justice central americas political problems will only multiply down the line we cannot isolate this debate from the fact that the sandinistas have already established an army that is larger than any central american army in history a russiancuban sponsored military force that is unpreedented and unjustified nicaraguan armed forces already exceed 75 000 troops and they have promised to follow through on their intention to expand this to 600 000 this is one promise i think we can count on the sandinistas to keep even as we have been talking about peace eastern bloc aid has been steadily fueling the sandinistas effort to consolidate their marxistleninist revolution we should not let daniel ortega and his allies dictate to us whether we will keep the opposition to this totalitarian attempt alive and in the field we must not turn our backs on the contras they are opposing a power which threatens the freedom and stability of the rest of cental americe we must support the cause of freedom in nicaragua because the freedom of all of central america depends on il we need to use every option available to us so that we never are faced with the prospect of sending american troops to fight widespread communist aggression and oppression in central america the contras are willing to fight for the right to live in a free nicaragua these are individuals who have left everything they have to fight for the freedom of their homeland many of these same individuals took part in the revolution against somoza and now have had their revolution stolen from them it is our moral duty to support them as they seek to brfng freedom to their homeland even though the sandinistas have officially lifted the state of emergency they still are using their power to keep the opposition oppressed as a leader of the social christian party recently said weve gone from a state of emergency to a state of terror the opposition leaders who were briefly jailed at the same time the sandinistas were making concessions are a clear example to the rest of nicaragua not to take their freedom too seriously if you take ortega at his word you could end up in jail the opposition parties do not have the freedom to organize and campaign because at any time they may be attacked by governmentsponsored terror these are the sandinistas on their best behavior as they try to court united states opinion to undermine contra aid what can we expect frum them once the contras have been disarmed we must continue to aid the contras until we have guarantees that actions such as this will not be used to ensure the endurance of a sandinista oneparty state the contras have demonstrated that they are the engine that is running the peace process without the contras the sandinistas will never negotiate away their power we must keep this chance for a negotiated solution alive with continued aid to thfreedom fighters in this case a vote against aid is a vote against freedom and against the peace process it has been suggested that we should just give peace a chance in nicaragua well the peace that is being proposed by some is easy to achieve because all it takes is for one side to lay down their arms and give up this is the option that is being proposed by ending aid to the contras by denying them the aid which would allow them to remain a viable force we are telling them to give up and go home to face the sandinistas unarmed we want to see a true peace established in centralgnmerlca a ceasefire and negotiated settlement will yield good results only if we do not leave the contras dependent on the good will of the sandinistas if we cut off aid to the contras we would weaken them just at the point when they are engaged in

weeks ago the house republican leadership took a special order to point out the pattern of increasing procedural abuses in the house and its committees the rules committee has been a particular problem in this area we have seen the increasing use of gag rules which restrict members ability to offer amendments and resolutions waiving all the standing rules of the house however there are some other problems affecting the rules committee which have received far less attention under its own committee rules members of the rules committee are entitled to 48 hours notice of a meeting in case of an emergency the chairman may dispense with the 48hour notice this sounds like a reasonable rule and it would be if it were not abused for years the current chairman and his predecessors used the emergency meeting procedure only for legitimate emergencies but recently we have seen a trend toward abuse in this area as well for example the routine bill before us today the treasury postal appropriation bill was declared to be an emergency last thursday afternoon so that the 48 hour notice could be dispensed with the committee met on friday morning with no final printed copy of the committee report available it didnt even have to be this way this bill could have been considered tomorrow and tomorrows appropriation bill for which a rule has not been requested could have been considered today last week we saw the same thing with the national science foundation bill that bill was declared to be an emergency in the rules committee so that it could be rushed through without the required 48 hours notice on may 25 once again there was no printed committee report available and little opportunity for members to learn about the provisions of the bill then after all the rush the rule was not even called up until 2 weeks later on june 9 p we all understand the need to move quickly in case of a real emergency but the abuse of the concept is the problem by repeatedly dispensing with the normal 48hour notice requirement it means that members are forced to vote before they have had an opportunity to properly review the legislation i hope that in the future the call of emergency meetings will be restricted to real emergencies aside from its emergency designation there is nothing unusual about the provisions of this rule it waives points of order against the bill
