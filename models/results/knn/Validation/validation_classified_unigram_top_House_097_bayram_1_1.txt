to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my colleagues to join me inthis bipartisan effort to restore economic vitality to this great nation by cosponsoring the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "a couple of weeks ago when we had a bill dealing with the ftc before this body there was a great clamor raised by a group

by virtue of this bill comning up under suspension an amendment cannot be offered by myself or others who feel likewise to amend section 2405 out of the bill it is indeed quite possible that if this section remains in the bill in the other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them

year 1982 299 million in 1983 313 million in 1984 and 327 million in the increased excise tax on coal is estimated to increase net tax receipts after accounting for lower income tax receipts as a result of the coal excise tax by 141 million in fiscal year 1982 218 million in 1983 and so forth these figures are set out in the committee report a accond reason for supporting this measure is that

to stay in school joblessness among high school dropouts may be stemmned dropouts are three times as likely as graduates to be unemployed employment training and education programs are targeted to the neediest youth and to those who can most benefit from these services the major design planning and initiation of these programs are at the local level where the needs of the youth can best be recognized the concern of members who may question the timeliness of a new domestic issue is understandable i support the need to cut back on federal spending but even though the mood of the country is one of budget austerity it is not necessarily a time to end or to cut back on policy development if we fail to take the initiative on youth unemployment and we fail to take up the obvious need to blend education and training programs for youth then we place an unfair burden on todays youth who will be the workers and taxpayers of tomorrow it is more cost effective to break the structural unemployment cycle in the beginning than to pixy for supportive services incarceration and unemployment insurance later on without this bill we may not make further progress toward solving the youth unemployment problem we must continue to discuss examine and consider carefully all the alternatives this bill builds upon what has proven to be successful youth unemployment is not an issue that will merely disappear"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today i am introducing legislation to provide needed tax incentives to help stimulate the development of our nations domestic energy resources this legislation the energy research and development tax incentives act of 1981 provides tax benefits to encourage private energy research and development activities and to facilitate the development and use of new energy technologies i believe that this tax incentive can play a key role in helping our nation tap its great energy potential and in reducing our reliance on uncertain foreign oil supplies it would also have important secondary benefits including the creation of new jobs the growth of various supporting industries and the generating of additional tax revenues from increased economic activity this legislation provides a 20percent investment tax credit for the capital costs of private sector energy research and development activities this incentive would be applicable for all energy research and development expenditures over and above a fixed level based on a 5year historical average of previous expenditures by any particular concern in this area the fixed level used in the calculation of eligible expenditures would be modified for tax years prior to 1985 in order to reflect administrative and bookkeeping realities my legislation permits this tax credit to be carried back for 3 years and to be carried forward for 7 years under appropriate conditions expenditures that would be covered under this legislation would include those relating to research and development activities in the extraction conversion storage transmission and utilization of fossil nuclear solar geothermal and other energy sources and in energy consevation this credit would take effect on january 1 1981 and would expire on december 31 1992 the science and technology committee has spend a great deal of time investigating the means to help cur nation develop more efficient and productive new energy technologies it was most disturbing to learn that the united states presently ranks 13th among 17 international energy agency nations in government support for research and development according to recent i e a estimates as for private sector support a harvard business review article released in the summer of 1980 pointed out that private sector investment in research and development has been steadily decreasing in recent years with no changes foreseen in the future this is a dangerous trend which i believe must be reversed as soon as possible in spite of these problems the administration position is that the federal government should only be involved in longrange highrisk research and development activities which private industry cannot reasonably be expected to undertake on the other hand industry is expected to support activities relating to the development of nearer term technologies based on this philosophy the administration has recommended dramatic reductions in funding for many energy research and development programs for fiscal year 1982 compared to last years appropriations levels during hearings on the department of energy authorization bill for fiscal year 1982 the committee heari from 22 witnesses on the need for strong government support to overcome the various market barriers affecting the use of new energy technologies and more efficient energy conservation techniques these witnesses have had a longstanding involvement in the energy area and gave our committee their expert views on energy research and development from an academic industrial consumer and governmental perspective several of these witnesses recommended investment tax credits in order to stimulate necessary energy research and development activities this incentive would help promote the development of promising new energy technologies without the need to conform to burdensome federal government management and reporting practices i believe that an investment tax credit for private energy research and development is vital if our nation is to continue to pursue the development of high payoff energy technologies that can help us develop and utilize our energy resources in a more efficient and effective manner according to several experts tax incentives for energy research and development are the most effective means of stiinulating increased private research and development spending at the present time with the removal of regulatory constraints following close behind these incentives are also compatible with the administrations approach that nearterm technologies should be the responsibility of the private sector in one particular area of concern to the science committee several witnesses indicated that conservation research and development programs were highly costeffective and antiinflationary and should be continued these programs support the develop ment of many new energyefficient processes in the residential commerclal industrial and transportation sectors for example several of the most energyefficient industrial processes now contemplated show that energy consumption per unit of output could be reduced by close to 50 percent with new technology under development in these programs dr dale jorgenson of harvard university specifically indicated that the impact on inflation due to increased petroleum prices is reduced by close to 50 percent if effective conservation programs are implemented several other witnesses indicated that foreign industry and governments were already making inroads into our domestic markets for new heat pumps furnaces and engines and that as a result there was a growing need for federal support to stimulate the development of new energyefficient conversion technologies made in the united states tax incentives were strongly recommended as one of the most effective means to encourage the continuation of many of these conservation research and development activities in another area of concern the science committee received a great deal of information and advice during the 96th congress on our nations fossil energy programs from an advisory panel on synthetic fuels this panel was convened by the science committee in order to explore the current state of synthetic fuels technologies and the related technical and engineering issues associated with the largescale production of synthetic fuels the panel was also asked to evaluate the department of energys current synthetic fuels research and development program and recommend any appropriate changes after many long hours of work the panel came to several important conclusions regarding the scope and direction of a national synthetic fuels program one of the major conclusions of this distinguished group of industry financial and government representatives was that tax incentives were one of the most effective mechanisms to assist in synthetic fuels production andthat they should be made available to stimulate technology improvements in this area consistent with these recommendations i believe that we need to provide strong tax support if our nation is to maintain an effective energy research and development program many of the experts which have recently testified before the science committee have made it very clear that there are many important areas where free market forces acting alone cannot provide the necessary incentives to stimulate private energy research and development activities the president has already recommended a 3year accelerated depreciation writeoff for the capital costs of research and development in his economic recovery program just recently the administration has proposed another research and development tax incentive which would provide for a 25 percent income tax credit for research and experimental wage expenditures i applaud the administrations leadership in this area my legislation attempts to supplement the presidents proposal in this area and encourage the private sector to move forward in an aggressive manner in energy research and development with minimal federal involvement in addition a recent seri report entitled building a sustainable future recommended a tax credit for corporate research investment which is 125 percent of actual expenses in lieu of the present federal tax deduction the premise for this recommendation was that private companies themselves were in the best position to determine what kinds of research were best suited to their needs while my legislation does not go as far as the seri recommendation it does provide a clear signal that our nation needs to maintain an aggressive energy research and development posture research and development has been one of the primary bases on which our nation has attained its world economic leadership the legislation which i am introducing today will help our nation maintain this leadership by stimulating private investment in new and more efficient energy technologies it is not meant to reflect the only appropriate means to stimulate private investment in energy research and development but only to encourage serious consideration of the importance of tax incentives in this area i encourage my colleagues to seriously consider this proposal in the weeks ahead as congress continues to consider a comprehensive tax program e"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "today i am introducing

savings and investment by reducing the maximum federal tax rates on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my

in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated

either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the military knowing they
