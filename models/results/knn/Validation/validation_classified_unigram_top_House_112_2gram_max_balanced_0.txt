that no longer exists in ordering federal immigration officials to break the 1996 immigration act which was passed by congress and signed into law today im calling on the judiciary and homeland

marine corps base in my district were there four of the five had lost both legsdouble amputees and the one kid that had his leg blown off by an ied i went into his room as i did the other four but this one had a question for me his mom was sitting in the room and he said congressman why are we still in afghanistan and i told the young lance corporal i dont know i cannot answer it i dont understand why we are not pushing the president to bring our troops home before 2014 and that leads me to a quote by ronald reagan from his book entitled an american life the autobiography based on reagans life and it dealt with lebanon and he was the president at the time perhaps we didnt appreciate fully enough the depth of the hatred and the complexity of the problems that made the middle east such a jungle perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry to paradise was so foreign to our values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the marines safety that it should have in the weeks immediately after the bombing i believed the last thing that we should do was turn tail and leave yet the irrationality of middle east politics forced us to rethink our policy there if there would be some rethinking of policy before our men die we would be a lot better off if that policy had changed towards more of a neutral position and neutrality those 241 marines would be alive today i thank mr reagan for his service to our nation and i thank him for those words i wish both parties would listen to leaders like ronald reagan who understood that youre not going to change the middle east no matter what you want to do or hope to do or pray to do you cant do it and you wont do it beside me are two little girls one named eden and one named stephanie they are at the graveside of their father sergeant kenneth bladuf sergeant in the united states marine corps about 2 months ago he was sent to afghanistan along with a colonel benjamin palmer from cherry point marine corps air station which is in my district also one night when they were having dinner with the afghan trainees one of the trainees pulled out a pistol and killed both of them it is so ironic that the day before sergeant bladuf was killed he had emailed his wife and he said i dont trust them i dont trust them i dont trust any of them and yet we keep spending 10 billion a month were going to cut programs from senior citizens and children in america we cant balance the budget but old mr karzai hell get his 10 billion a month the congress needs to look at this and start bringing our troops home before 2014 also in sundays paper it says suicide bomber hits nato bus 17 people including 12 americans are killed in the deadliest attack since the war began i hope that we dont have to continue to go to walter reedbethesda and see all of these broken bodies if were going to be there until 2014 there are going to be a lot more broken bodies and dead young men and women i hope the leadership of both parties will start joining those of us in both parties and bring our troops home before 2014 again i state to all the children like eden and stephanie be proud of your moms and your dads but for those of us who are policymakers we have the responsibilitynot the generals but we the policymakersof sending our young men and women to die and lose their

defining aspect of the american tradition is that groups of citizens band together for a wide variety of civic purposes they recruit volunteers raise funds and spend those funds to promote whatever project or cause brings them together for more than a century our tax laws have recognized that such voluntary associationsnonprofits as we call them todayshould not be taxed because their proceeds are devoted entirely to improve our communities through education advocacy and civic action section 501 of the internal revenue code recognizes them today and civic groups as diverse as moveon org the league of conservation voters the aclu the national rifle association and various taxpayer groups have always been included in this definition we dont apply a political test to these civic groups we recognize the fundamental right of americans to organize and to pool their resources to promote whatever causes they believe in left or right indeed whatever their political persuasion these civic groups perform an absolutely indispensable role in our democracy by raising public awareness defining issues educating voters promoting reforms holding officials accountable and petitioning their government to redress grievances abolition womens suffrage the civil rights movementall would have been impossible without them in order to be recognized as nonprofit groups these organizations must register with the irsa purely ministerial function that in the past has been applied evenly and without regard to their political views at least until now it seems that tea party groups are today being treated very differently than their counterparts on the political left for the last 2 years many have been stonewalled by the irs when they sought to register as nonprofits most recently they have been barraged with increasingly aggressive and threatening demands vastly outside the legal authority of the irs indeed the only conceivable purpose of some of these demands is to intimidate and harass a tea party group in my district is typical of the reports that we are now hearing across this country this group submitted articles of incorporation as a nonprofit to the state of california and they received approval within a month but then they tried to register as a nonprofit with the irs despite repeated and numerous inquiries the irs stonewalled this group for a year and a half at which time it demanded thousands of pages of documentation and gave the group less than 3 weeks to produce it the irs demanded the names of every participant at every meeting held over the last 2 years transcripts of every speech given at those meetings what positions they had taken on issues the names of their volunteers and donors and copies of communications they had with elected officials and on and on perhaps most chilling of all the organizer of this particular group soon found herself the object of a personal income tax audit by the irs these are groups of volunteers who pass the hat at meetings to pay for renting the hall they give of their own time to research issues and pay out of their own pockets for printing flyers the donations made to them arent tax deductible so there is no legitimate purpose in asking for the names of their donors let alone of their volunteers unlessand this is the fine point of itunless the purpose is to harass and intimidate ironically the same tactics we now see used by the united states against tea parties were once used by the most abusive of the southern states in the 1950s to intimidate civil rights groups like the naacp no such tactics have been reported by similar civic groups on the political left so the conclusion is inescapablethat this administration is very clearly very pointedly and very deliberately attempting to intimidate harass and threaten civicminded groups with which they disagree using one of the most feared and powerful agencies of the united states government to do so these facts speak for themselves they need no embellishment or interpretation they should alarm every american of goodwill regardless of political philosophy for if this precedent is allowed to stand no ones freedom is safe i bring these facts

on what the interest rate should be will now be audited they will be subject to being quizzed about why they did that now i will tell my democratic friends understand that one part of this problem is

of discretion and the unilateral rewriting of federal immigration policy"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "27 times the united states constitution has been amended its something we do rarely and its something that we should think through in the process we do it only because it is absolutely required and we have common agreement across the house the senate and the american people this is one of those moments if you ask most every american on the street should we balance our budget they will nod their head if you ask them again should we force congress to balance the budget again they will nod their head and say yes this is something we should do there is common agreement across the american people because its common sense its hard to explain to any family or any business why they have to balance their budget but congress does not it is the ultimate exemption for members of congress that they can spend as much as they want as often as they would like without any retribution i hear all the doomsday statements that if we balanced our budget what would possibly happen if we had to live within our means it makes me smile and say just like every business and every family we have to make hard choices and we have to do it but its not what doomsday prediction happens if we balance our budget it is look up across the ocean at what is happening in europe right now to nations that did not balance their budget and for some reason we think as americans we can run up as much debt as we would like with no consequence we are fooling ourselves the doomsday is coming we must put a boundary around the united states congress to be able to balance our budget in 1995 when this failed by one vote we will forever regret that if this occurs again its time for us to balance our budget once and for all"],

had the privilege and the honor to visit our wounded at walter reedbethesda it so happened that five marines from camp lejeune marine corps base in my district were there four of the five had lost both legsdouble amputees and the one kid that had his leg blown off by an ied i went into his room as i did the other four but this one had a question for me his mom was sitting in the room and he said congressman why are we still in afghanistan and i told the young lance corporal i dont know i cannot answer it i dont understand why we are not pushing the president to bring our troops home before 2014 and that leads me to a quote by ronald reagan from his book entitled an american life the autobiography based on reagans life and it dealt with lebanon and he was the president at the time perhaps we didnt appreciate fully enough the depth of the hatred and the complexity of the problems that made the middle east such a jungle perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry to paradise was so foreign to our values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the marines safety that it should have in the weeks immediately after the bombing i believed the last thing that we should do was turn tail and leave yet the irrationality of middle east politics forced us to rethink our policy there if there would be some rethinking of policy before our men die we would be a lot better off if that policy had changed towards more of a neutral position and neutrality those 241 marines would be alive today i thank mr reagan for his service to our nation and i thank him for those words i wish both parties would listen to leaders like ronald reagan who understood that youre not going to change the middle east no matter what you want to do or hope to do or pray to do you cant do it and you wont do it beside me are two little girls one named eden and one named stephanie they are at the graveside of their father sergeant kenneth bladuf sergeant in the united states marine corps about 2 months ago he was sent to afghanistan along with a colonel benjamin palmer from cherry point marine corps air station which is in my district also one night when they were having dinner with the afghan trainees one of the trainees pulled out a pistol and killed both of them it is so ironic that the day before sergeant bladuf was killed he had emailed his wife and he said i dont trust them i dont trust them i dont trust any of them and yet we keep spending 10 billion a month were going to cut programs from senior citizens and children in america we cant balance the budget but old mr karzai hell get his 10 billion a month the congress needs to look at this and start bringing our troops home before 2014 also in sundays paper it says suicide bomber hits nato bus 17 people including 12 americans are killed in the deadliest attack since the war began i hope that we dont have to continue to go to walter reedbethesda and see all of these broken bodies if were going to be there until 2014 there are going to be a lot more broken bodies and dead young men and women i hope the leadership of both parties will start joining those of us in both parties and bring our troops home before 2014 again i state to all the children like eden and stephanie be proud of your moms and your dads but for those of us who are policymakers we have the responsibilitynot the generals but we the policymakersof sending our young men and women to die and lose their limbs for absolutely nothing but a corrupt leader i will close right now with the same closing i do all the time god please bless our men and women in uniform please bless the families of our men and women in uniform god in your loving arms hold the families who have given a child dying for freedom in afghanistan and iraq god please bless the house and senate that we will do what is right in your eyes please bless president obama that he will do what is right in your eyes for his people and three times i will say god please god please god please continue to bless america"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a defining aspect of the american tradition is that groups of citizens band together for a wide variety of civic purposes they recruit volunteers raise funds and spend those funds to promote whatever project or cause brings them together for more than a century our tax laws have recognized that such voluntary associationsnonprofits as we call them todayshould not be taxed because their proceeds are devoted entirely to improve our communities through education advocacy and civic action section 501 of the internal revenue code recognizes them today and civic groups as diverse as moveon org the league of conservation voters the aclu the national rifle association and various taxpayer groups have always been included in this definition we dont apply a political test to these civic groups we recognize the fundamental right of americans to organize and to pool their resources to promote whatever causes they believe in left or right indeed whatever their political persuasion these civic groups perform an absolutely indispensable role in our democracy by raising public awareness defining issues educating voters promoting reforms holding officials accountable and petitioning their government to redress grievances abolition womens suffrage the civil rights movementall would have been impossible without them in order to be recognized as nonprofit groups these organizations must register with the irsa purely ministerial function that in the past has been applied evenly and without regard to their political views at least until now it seems that tea party groups are today being treated very differently than their counterparts on the political left for the last 2 years many have been stonewalled by the irs when they sought to register as nonprofits most recently they have been barraged with increasingly aggressive and threatening demands vastly outside the legal authority of the irs indeed the only conceivable purpose of some of these demands is to intimidate and harass a tea party group in my district is typical of the reports that we are now hearing across this country this group submitted articles of incorporation as a nonprofit to the state of california and they received approval within a month but then they tried to register as a nonprofit with the irs despite repeated and numerous inquiries the irs stonewalled this group for a year and a half at which time it demanded thousands of pages of documentation and gave the group less than 3 weeks to produce it the irs demanded the names of every participant at every meeting held over the last 2 years transcripts of every speech given at those meetings what positions they had taken on issues the names of their volunteers and donors and copies of communications they had with elected officials and on and on perhaps most chilling of all the organizer of this particular group soon found herself the object of a personal income tax audit by the irs these are groups of volunteers who pass the hat at meetings to pay for renting the hall they give of their own time to research issues and pay out of their own pockets for printing flyers the donations made to them arent tax deductible so there is no legitimate purpose in asking for the names of their donors let alone of their volunteers unlessand this is the fine point of itunless the purpose is to harass and intimidate ironically the same tactics we now see used by the united states against tea parties were once used by the most abusive of the southern states in the 1950s to intimidate civil rights groups like the naacp no such tactics have been reported by similar civic groups on the political left so the conclusion is inescapablethat this administration is very clearly very pointedly and very deliberately attempting to intimidate harass and threaten civicminded groups with which they disagree using one of the most feared and powerful agencies of the united states government to do so these facts speak for themselves they need no embellishment or interpretation they should alarm every american of goodwill regardless of political philosophy for if this precedent is allowed to stand no ones freedom is safe i bring these facts to the attention of the house today and ask that they be rigorously investigated and if found accurate that those officials responsible be exposed disgraced dismissed and debarred from any further position of trust or power within our government"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "a failure of leadership his own words thank you congressman it has been a treat to have you joining us here this afternoon i want to run back over to utah to my good
