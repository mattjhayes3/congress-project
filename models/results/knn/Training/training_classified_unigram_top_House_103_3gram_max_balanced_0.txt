the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 some of you may have watched the television program 60 minutes last sunday and were as aghast as i was at the ease with which we see aliens coming into this country at our airports and other ports of entry who have fraudulent documents or no documents at all and how they can come in and if this is the case simply say i claim political asylum i am in fear of persecution if i am returned to country x y or z and immediately the immigration officers release them into the public domain of the united states they give them a work permit they allow them to go get a social security card and a drivers license and 90 percent of them are never seen again not before a hearing officer or anywhere else it is absolutely absurd how this can happen and i am disappointed that we have not had hearings on this subject before i introduced a similar bill to the one i am talking about this time in the last congress but we have not yet addressed the matter what is happening in this country is that we have got a system abroad of people who are smuggling folks into our country taking advantage of a very big loophole in our law if somebody comes to this country and he or she has no documents at all we should not allow that to happen that they can just walk away into the society and have a work permit and so forth the reason why technically this is being done is because we are very liberal on giving someone the right to claim asylum when they first set foot in our nation either on the sandy shores of the beach or in an airport we say if you profess the right magic word and say that youre afraid that youre going to be persecuted back in your homeland because of some political beliefs or religious beliefs then were going to give you the opportunity to go before an immigration judge and have a full hearing on this matter well the problem is the immigration judges are not sitting at the airports of this nation waiting to hear these cases they have backlogs a hundred thousand cases sitting there in the nation today waiting to be heard it takes literally years to hear these cases and all of that time while people are waiting to be heard they are existing out in the countryside and oftentimes are not even showing up for these hearings when somebody goes to jfk as the 60 minutes report showed that they did do on sunday and they make this political asylum claim there is no room to hold them even overnight at jfk they are full at the house so to speak at the little bit of detention center immigration services has so they are immediately parolled into the country and given this temporary work permit and they are told they have a hearing in another couple of months they are supposed to come to just a preliminary hearing it does not resolve anything and then there may be 3 or 4 years or perhaps a few months if they are lucky for coming back for a fullfledged hearing if they show up what my bill does is very simple it says if you come in with a fraudulent document or no document at all any port of entry whether its an airport or a land port you are going to be assigned to a specially trained asylum officer there are already 150 of them in the immigration service today and that specially trained asylum officer is going to ask a series of questions to determine if they have a credible fear of persecution if they return to their homeland my bill says if you dont have a document at all if youve not made a political asylum claim or if you do not present a credible fear of persecution to this asylum officer youll be put on the very next return plane and shipped back to the country of origin you are not going to have a day in court here and an immigration judge type court youre not going to be given a temporary work permit youre not going to be allowed to get a social security card or a drivers license youre going to be shipped back where you came from and i think that is very important 35 000 came through our airports alone last year in this category 15 000 of them at kennedy in new york and most of those 90 percent of those we will never see again before an immigration judge they are here as a practical matter they are here permanently because we do not have a system to round them up as my colleagues heard the other night on 60 minutes one of those was the fellow who we believe was involved in the shooting at the cia in langley va a few weeks ago he came over here and was given this status because he did not have the right documents but he claimed political asylum i would submit that the bill that i am introducing with a number of cosponsors today is the only practical way to grant relief to this nation to our people and that we need to get on with the business of screening out those who do not have legitimate claims and i would hope that we will have hearings shortly on this subject and that this type of legislation will be put in place so that we do not have people coming into this country getting into our system buying their way in in many cases i understand they may pay as much as 30 000 for these fraudulent documents and for the advice that tells them the magic words to claim the political asylum if my proposal were to be adopted i believe that most of this would end and we could go back to a much more reasonable basis for operating in the last 2 years alone there has been a 300percent increase in the number of people coming in through this political asylum claim with fraudulent documents or a lack of documents at our airports a 300percent increase it could only be because the people out there in the other world know that this is a way to beat the system and i would submit to my colleagues that there may be many of those who come in who are not so innocent who may be terrorists or potential terrorists the threat to our security as well as the threat to our orderly immigration system is at risk i would urge my colleagues to look at the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 and consider cosponsoring them and urging hearings and a markup as expe ditiously as possible to put in place a system that will stop this kind of nonsense once and for all i submit for the record a sectionbysection analysis of the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 sectionbysection analysisexclusion"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "1 i thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me there is more to this bill than prohibiting gifts from lobbyists in my opinion this bill is big brotherism from washington at its worst disguised as an ethics reform for congress why do i say this i say it because there are a number of provisions in the bill that pa t so much control over private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up to 10 000 and could be as mnh as 200 09 now the gentleman there said the ethics rules in this house would penalize a member of this house in the event that they broke the law that is in this bill i would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine now we talk about the pac contributions the gentleman from texas the sponsor of this bill from april 9 of this year to june 20 got 76 percent of his campaign contributions from pacs 42 500 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say that it would probably have nore of an impact on him than a big mac that he is getting from the same people who are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind of ethics rules of this house u 1520 by doing that we would not create a new bureaucracy costing millions of dollars to the american taxpayer and infringing on their rights to contact their congressman under the threat of a 100 090 fine"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "1 minute is hardly

transportation to formulate the approved interchange design at an estimated total cost of 90 million ompletion of the route 17 route 4 interchange project is heavily dependent upon federal funding

the time of day during the house proceedings e g 0 1407 is 2 07 printed on recycled paper containing 100 post consumer waste whiie i share the administrations enthusiasm about this program my biggest concern is that they are planning to do the review from the inside out why not take a lesson from the private sector and utilize objective advice from outside sources and business experts it is naive to believe that the huge federal bureaucracy will reform itself we want a leaner trimmer bureaucracy but let us make sure we do not sacrifice objectivity along the way"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "yesterday i introduced a bill that will reform medicaid at a time when medicaid reform is absolutely critical the solution the medicaid health allowance act of 1993 addresses two of the biggest obstacles facing health care reform namely skyrocketing medicaid costs and a growing population of americans unable to afford health insurance this proposal helps to solve both problems it does so by allowing states to redirect medicaid funds into health allowance programs these programs enroll eligible individuals in private market health plans that hold down inflation for states that participate it curbs inflation of health care costs and provides relief to states which are suffering from doubledigit inflation of medicaid it also insures more people now medicaid covers less than 50 percent of people under the poverty level leaving 10 million people living in poverty uninsured this creates a gappeople who cannot qualify for medicaid and who cannot afford to buy insurance expanded access provides coverage for those in the gap and an option exists to extend coverage to the working poor above the poverty level the extra cost to insure these people is covered by redirecting the federal disproportionate share already paid to states for uncompensated hospital care to the poor no new taxes or spending is required we know such programs work and that people gain better care and live healthier lives i have seen it work with the dayton area health plan which has been able to achieve tremendous cost savings and it is working in other states as well with this plan you insure more people at a lower cost per person you minimize expensive and inefficient emergency room hospital care and you provide higher quality of care"]], "top_unsure": [[0.5, 0.0, 0, "0 mcclellan chair

1993 some of you may have watched the television program 60 minutes last sunday and were as aghast as i was at the ease with which we see aliens coming into this country at our airports and other ports of entry who have fraudulent documents or no documents at all and how they can come in and if this is the case simply say i claim political asylum i am in fear of persecution if i am returned to country x y or z and immediately the immigration officers release them into the public domain of the united states they give them a work permit they allow them to go get a social security card and a drivers license and 90 percent of them are never seen again not before a hearing officer or anywhere else it is absolutely absurd how this can happen and i am disappointed that we have not had hearings on this subject before i introduced a similar bill to the one i am talking about this time in the last congress but we have not yet addressed the matter what is happening in this country is that we have got a system abroad of people who are smuggling folks into our country taking advantage of a very big loophole in our law if somebody comes to this country and he or she has no documents at all we should not allow that to happen that they can just walk away into the society and have a work permit and so forth the reason why technically this is being done is because we are very liberal on giving someone the right to claim asylum when they first set foot in our nation either on the sandy shores of the beach or in an airport we say if you profess the right magic word and say that youre afraid that youre going to be persecuted back in your homeland because of some political beliefs or religious beliefs then were going to give you the opportunity to go before an immigration judge and have a full hearing on this matter well the problem is the immigration judges are not sitting at the airports of this nation waiting to hear these cases they have backlogs a hundred thousand cases sitting there in the nation today waiting to be heard it takes literally years to hear these cases and all of that time while people are waiting to be heard they are existing out in the countryside and oftentimes are not even showing up for these hearings when somebody goes to jfk as the 60 minutes report showed that they did do on sunday and they make this political asylum claim there is no room to hold them even overnight at jfk they are full at the house so to speak at the little bit of detention center immigration services has so they are immediately parolled into the country and given this temporary work permit and they are told they have a hearing in another couple of months they are supposed to come to just a preliminary hearing it does not resolve anything and then there may be 3 or 4 years or perhaps a few months if they are lucky for coming back for a fullfledged hearing if they show up what my bill does is very simple it says if you come in with a fraudulent document or no document at all any port of entry whether its an airport or a land port you are going to be assigned to a specially trained asylum officer there are already 150 of them in the immigration service today and that specially trained asylum officer is going to ask a series of questions to determine if they have a credible fear of persecution if they return to their homeland my bill says if you dont have a document at all if youve not made a political asylum claim or if you do not present a credible fear of persecution to this asylum officer youll be put on the very next return plane and shipped back to the country of origin you are not going to have a day in court here and an immigration judge type court youre not going to be given a temporary work permit youre not going to be allowed to get a social security card or a drivers license youre going to be shipped back where you came from and i think that is very important 35 000 came through our airports alone last year in this category 15 000 of them at kennedy in new york and most of those 90 percent of those we will never see again before an immigration judge they are here as a practical matter they are here permanently because we do not have a system to round them up as my colleagues heard the other night on 60 minutes one of those was the fellow who we believe was involved in the shooting at the cia in langley va a few weeks ago he came over here and was given this status because he did not have the right documents but he claimed political asylum i would submit that the bill that i am introducing with a number of cosponsors today is the only practical way to grant relief to this nation to our people and that we need to get on with the business of screening out those who do not have legitimate claims and i would hope that we will have hearings shortly on this subject and that this type of legislation will be put in place so that we do not have people coming into this country getting into our system buying their way in in many cases i understand they may pay as much as 30 000 for these fraudulent documents and for the advice that tells them the magic words to claim the political asylum if my proposal were to be adopted i believe that most of this would end and we could go back to a much more reasonable basis for operating in the last 2 years alone there has been a 300percent increase in the number of people coming in through this political asylum claim with fraudulent documents or a lack of documents at our airports a 300percent increase it could only be because the people out there in the other world know that this is a way to beat the system and i would submit to my colleagues that there may be many of those who come in who are not so innocent who may be terrorists or potential terrorists the threat to our security as well as the threat to our orderly immigration system is at risk i would urge my colleagues to look at the exclusion and asylum reform amendments of 1993 and consider cosponsoring them and urging hearings and a markup as expe ditiously as possible to put in place a system that will stop this kind of nonsense once and for all i submit

me there is more to this bill than prohibiting gifts from lobbyists in my opinion this bill is big brotherism from washington at its worst disguised as an ethics reform for congress why do i say this i say it because there are a number of provisions in the bill that pa t so much control over private groups in the hands of the federal government and not the federal government but one person who is going to decide whether or not they violated the law ahd the penalties for individuals is up to 10 000 and could be as mnh as 200 09 now the gentleman there said the ethics rules in this house would penalize a member of this house in the event that they broke the law that is in this bill i would like to ask anybody here when was the last time you heard of any member being penalized to the tune of 10 000 or s200 000 it just does not happen for to you say it happens is erroneous it simply is not going to happen you might chastise them or censure them here in this body but they are not going to be penalized like the average citizen who is going to get hit with a 10 000 or 200 000 fine now we talk about the pac contributions the gentleman from texas the sponsor of this bill from april 9 of this year to june 20 got 76 percent of his campaign contributions from pacs 42 500 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say that it would probably have nore of an impact on him than a big mac that he is getting from the same people who are giving him this money from january 1 to february 16 of this year he got 45 percent of the money from pacs or 26s357 11 now i am not saying that influences him but i would say it would have more of an impact on him or anybody else than a big mac yet if somebody takes a member of congress out and buys him a sandwich he is guilty of breaking the law and can be penalized 10 000 but he cannot be if he gives him 45 0 where is the logic in that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this bill will stop kill in my opinion many philanthropic organizations that give millions of dollars to cancer research projects child and wife abuse centers ronald mcdonald houses and others because it in effect prohibits any congressman from participating in those charitable zvents you are not going to be able to do it anymore believe it or not folks some people like us to go to these events and raise money for these charities that is prohibited so who is going to pick up the tab it is going to be the taxpayers because those philanthropic organizations are not going to get that money in the future my question to my colleagues is why not make all lunches or all dinners or any event reportable on the reports that we ble we have to ieport about 9 reports this year alone why not zoport all of that if we did that the public would know cur onstituents would know who we are having lunch with and who is taking us out to play golf or something and the media would know make no mistake about it the media watchers every single thing we do around here so they would know if we were grossly violating or even remotely violating any kind of ethics rules of this house u 1520 by doing that we would not create a new bureaucracy costing
