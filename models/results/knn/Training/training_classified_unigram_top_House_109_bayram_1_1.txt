that is what this is all about i am glad i had the opportunity to update the gentlewomans perspective on that the 6ther thing i would note is that again this would be the only federal agency treated in this manner the only federal agency and there is really no justification for it i have heard a great deal about budget scoring and i cannot speak as to the author of this amendment but i suspect he along with others including myself stood in the well of this house many many times and spoke about the moronic perspective of scoring when it came to tax cuts we did not want that kind of scoring the

few years the reasons are really pretty simple first we are trying to do way too much for other countries we have spent 300 billion in the last 3 years in iraq and afghanistan probably over half of it is just pure foreign aid we have every department and agency in the federal government doing operations overseas spending several hundred billion a year over there the liberal stand out here is that foreign aid was not popular so they will very possibly tell you that foreign aid is only 12 percent of the budget when we add up what all the departments and agencies are doing it is just phenomenal how much we are spending in other countries i heard a news report recently that said the fbi has more offices in other countries than we have in the unitedstates secondly we have promised too much here at home in retirement and medical benefits thirdly we will not reduce defense or homeland security spending even though there is waste in those departments just like all the other departments and there just simply is not enough money to pay for all of it on january 26 of this year the congressional budget office said the federal deficit for this fiscal year which ends september 30 will be around 360 billion some people say it will be much higher than that and similar amounts 350 billion to 400 billion for each of the next 10 or 11 years all of this comes on top of the national debt that is already 8 3 trillion and headed up very quickly our government in just a few years will not be able to pay all of the military pensions the civil service pensions the social security the medicare the medicaid and the new prescription drug benefit we have guaranteed 44 million private pensions through the pension benefit guaranty corporation we will just not be able to pay all those things with money that means anything but what we will do we will do what governments all over the world have done in similar situations and we will simply begin printing more money this will cause social security and all those government and private pension plans to buy less each year it doesnt work it is like a ball headed downhill its starts out slow and gathers speed when this money supply gimmick does not do enough pensions will have to be cut anyone who is relying just on social security for his or her retirement will face tremendous financial hardship all of this could be avoided if the congress would become much more fiscally conservative and do it now however because there are too many liberal big spenders in the congress aind because it is unpopular to say no to anyone the congress could not even late last year pass a 50 billion slowdown in spending spreadover the next 5 years the overall reduction was reduced to 39 5 billion with the bulk of the reductions put off until the fourth and fifth years the plan that was passed did not cut spending it simply slowed the rate of growth barely but of course even that very meager effort at fiscal restraint could be changed by the next congress now let me go to a totally different topic mr speaker another concern at the end of 1994 the conservative business magazine forbes carried a lengthy article about the justice department it said we had quadrupled the justice department since 1980 and that federal prosecutors were falling all over themselves trying to find cases to prosecute the article said people were being prosecuted for laws they didnt even know were in existence and then the congress trying to prove it was tough on crime has expanded the department of justice greatly since then in addition to all this expansion we then passed a socalled patriot act to try to show strong opposition to terrorism this was such a great expansion of government power and such an overreach that now approximately 400 cities and counties and seven state legislatures have passed resolutions against this act those who love big government love the patriot act the federal government through the supersecret national security agency in addition to the cia fbi and about 12 other intelligence agencies has more than enough power and ways and means to discover and prosecute terrorists the foreign intelligence surveillance act court created in 1978 approveal 18 742 warrants for wiretapping and physical surveillance by the end of 2004 in the 5 years from 2000 to 2004 the court received 6 650

which have sprung up to fight terrorism do not like to admit this because they want continual increases in funding but we should not create some kind of a federal police state in a huge overreaction

object to the manner in which this body chooses to honor him i wonder if my colleagues see the irony in honoring a devout buddhist monk with a material gift of gold the buddhist tradition of course eschews worldly possessions in favor of purity of thought and action buddhism urges its practitioners to alleviate the suffering of others whenever possible im sure his holiness the dalai lama would rather see 30 000 spent to help those less fortunate rather than for a feelgood congressional gesture we cannot forget that congress has no authority under the constitution to spend taxpayer money on medals and awards no matter how richly deserved and i reiterate my offer of 100 from my own pocket to pay for this medal if members wish to honor the dalai lama all we need to do is pay for it ourselves if all 435 of us contribute the cost will be roughly 70 each so while a gold medal sounds like a great idea it becomes a bit strange when we see the actual cost involved if congress truly wishes to honor the dalai lama it could instead start by showing more respect for his views in the areas of foreign policy war and terrorism the bellicosity often demonstrated on the floor of this institution toward entire nations and their people conflicts sharply with the peaceful teachings of the dalai lama consider the following words of his holiness when september 11 happened the next day i wrote a letter to president bush as a friendbecause i know him personally i wrote this letter and expressed besides my condolences and sadness a countermeasure to this tragedy a nonviolent response because that would have been more effective so this is my stance and then just before the iraq crisis started millions of people from countries like australia and america expressed their opposition to violence i really admired and appreciated this when the war started some people immediately asked me if it was justified or not whether it was right or wrong in principle any resort to violence is wrong consider also these thoughts from the dalai lama regarding the terrible pointlessness of war we have seen that we cannot solve human problems by fighting problems resulting from differences in opinion must be resolved through the gradual process of dialogue undoubtedly wars produce victors and losers but only temporarily victory or defeat resulting from wars cannot be longlasting secondly our world has become so interdependent that the defeat of one country must impact the rest of the world or cause all of us to suffer losses either directly or indirectly today the world is so small and so interdependent that the concept of war has become anachronistic an outmoded approach as a rule we always talk about reform and changes among the old traditions there are many aspects that are either illsuited to our present reality or are counterproductive due to their shortsightedness these we have consigned to the dustbin of history war too should be relegated to the dustbin of history of course the militaristic tradition may not end easily but let us think of this if there were bloodshed people in positions of power or those who are responsible will find safe places they will escape the consequent hardship they will find safety for themselves one way or the other but what about the poor people the defenseless people the children the old and infirm they are the ones who

perspective on that the 6ther thing i would note is that again this would be the only federal agency treated in this manner the only federal agency and there is really no justification for it i have heard a great deal about budget scoring and i cannot speak as to the author of this amendment but i suspect he along with others including myself stood in the well of this house many many times and spoke about the moronic perspective of scoring when it came to tax cuts we did not want that kind of scoring the same kind of scoring that is applied here we wanted dynamic scoring and if we were dynamically scoring i think we would be referring to the statistics provided by others including the envelope manufacturing association that says if this amendment were to pass it would result in the

headed for a financial tsunami not long after the baby boomers start retiring in large numbers over the next few years the reasons are really pretty simple first we are trying to do way too much for other countries we have spent 300 billion in the last 3 years in iraq and afghanistan probably over half of it is just pure foreign aid we have every department and agency in the federal government doing operations overseas spending several hundred billion a year over there the liberal stand out here is that foreign aid was not popular so they will very possibly tell you that foreign aid is only 12 percent of the budget when we add up what all the departments and agencies are doing it is just phenomenal how much we are spending in other countries i heard a news report recently that said the fbi has more offices in other countries than we have in the unitedstates secondly we have promised too much here at home in retirement and medical benefits thirdly we will not reduce defense or homeland security spending even though there is waste in those departments just like all the other departments and there just simply is not enough money to pay for all of it on january 26 of this year the congressional budget office said the federal deficit for this fiscal year which ends september 30 will be around 360 billion some people say it will be much higher than that and similar amounts 350 billion to 400 billion for each of the next 10 or 11 years all of this comes on top of the national debt that is already 8 3 trillion and headed up very quickly our government in just a few years will not be able to pay all of the military pensions the civil service pensions the social security the medicare the medicaid and the new prescription drug benefit we have guaranteed 44 million private pensions through the pension benefit guaranty corporation we will just not be able to pay all those things with money that means anything but what we will do we will do what governments all over the world have done in similar situations and we will simply begin printing more money this will cause social security and all those government and private pension plans to buy less each year it doesnt work it is like a ball headed downhill its starts out slow and gathers speed when this money supply gimmick does not do enough pensions will have to be cut anyone who is relying just on social security for his or her retirement will face tremendous financial hardship all of this could be avoided if the congress would become much more fiscally conservative and do it now however because there are too many liberal big spenders in the congress aind because it is unpopular to say no to anyone the congress could not even late last year pass a 50 billion slowdown in spending spreadover the next 5 years the overall reduction was reduced to 39 5 billion with the bulk of the reductions put off until the fourth and fifth years the plan that was passed did not cut spending it simply slowed the rate of growth barely but of course even that very meager effort at fiscal restraint could be changed by the next congress now let me go to a totally different topic mr speaker another concern at the end of 1994 the conservative business magazine forbes carried a lengthy article about the justice department it said we had quadrupled the justice department since 1980 and that federal prosecutors were falling all over themselves trying to find cases to prosecute the article said people were being prosecuted for laws they didnt even know were in existence and then the congress trying to prove it was tough on crime has expanded the department of justice greatly since then in addition to all this expansion we then passed a socalled patriot act to try to show strong opposition to terrorism this was such a great expansion of government power and such an overreach that now approximately 400 cities and counties and seven state legislatures have passed resolutions against this act those who love big government love the patriot act the federal government through the supersecret national security agency in addition to the cia fbi and about 12 other intelligence agencies has more than enough power and ways and means to discover and prosecute terrorists the foreign intelligence surveillance act court created in 1978 approveal 18 742 warrants for wiretapping and physical surveillance

without the patriot act we need to take reasonable precautions but we also need to recognize that you are still hundreds of times more likely to be struck by lightning or to win a lottery than you are to be killed by a terrorist those in charge of all the many government programs which have sprung up to fight terrorism do not like to admit this because they want continual increases in funding but we should not create some kind of a federal police state in a huge overreaction to this threat it is sad that conservatives who have always been the main opponents of big government have gone along
