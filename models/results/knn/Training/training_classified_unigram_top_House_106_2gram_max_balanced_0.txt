should say so so that we can move beyond the failure of the conferences committee every day that goes by without passage into law of a real patient protection bill means that people are being harmed by hmos that care more about their bottom line more about their most recent stock quotes on wall street than they care about patients let me give some examples of people who have been harmed by hmos before coming to congress i was a reconstructive surgeon i took care of little children that were born with birth defects like this little baby with a cleft lip and palate do my colleagues know that in the last several years more than 50 percent of the surgeon who care for children born with this birth defect have had cases like these refused by hmos who call this a cosmetic deformity this is a birth defect the operation to repair this would be to restore towards normalcy that is not a cosmetic case under any definition a couple of years ago now this ladys case was profiled on the cover of time magazine this woman lived in california her hmodid not tell her all that she needed to know furthermore they put pressure on the medicare center treating her not to tell her because she did not get that information in a timely fashion and because her hmo did not play straight with her on getting her the treatment that she needed as medically necessary she died today her children and her husband do not have a mother and a wife a couple of years ago a young woman was hiking in the mountains about 70 miles west of washington d c she fell off a 40foot cliff she broke her pelvis fractured her arm broke her skull was lying at the bottom of this 40foot cliff when her boyfriend who had a cellular phone managed to get a helicopter in they took her to the emergency room she was treated she lived but then do members know what the hmo would not pay her bill because she had not phoned ahead for prior authorization was she supposed to have a crystal ball that was going to tell her that she was going to fall off a 40foot cliff so she could make a phone call to her hmo i have shared these stories with my colleagues in the past but i have some new ones tonight that are going to amaze my colleagues this is also a story a true story about a little boy we can see him here tagging on his sisters sleeve one night his temperature was about 104 or 105 degrees and his mother phoned the 1800 number for their hmo and said my baby needs to go to the emergency room he is really sick she got somebody thousands of miles away who said well i will only authorize you to take him to one emergency room and when the mother asked where it was the person said i do not know find a map it turned out that the hmo was about 60 or 70 miles away en route this little baby had a cardiac arrest if one is a mom and dad driving this little baby to the hospital members can imagine what that was like when they finally found it the mother leaped out of the car holding her little baby screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse came out started resuscitation they put in the i v lines gave him mouthtomouth resuscitation gave him the medicines and they managed to bring his life back all because that hmo did not have the common sense or decency to say if your baby isreally sick take him to the nearest emergency room because en route they passed three emergency rooms but they were not authorized by that hmo this little baby managed to survive but because he had that cardiac arrest he lost the circulation to his hands and his feet and he had to have both hands and both feet amputated why do 80 percentplus of the american public think that congress should pass an hmo reform bill a patient protection bill a real bill because their friends and neighbors have had problems just like some of those that i have shown the members a few years ago there was a movie as good as it gets in that movie helen hunt is talking to her friend jack nicholson and explaining how this hmo that they belong to will not properly take care of her son who has asthma then she let loose a string of expletives that i cannot repeat on the floor of congress but i can tell the members what happened in the theater that my wife and i were in it happened all across the country people started cheering and clapping and even standing up in applause because they knew the truth of that allegation no law has passed because the hmos have spent over 100 million lobbying against real patient protection legislation they have given generously to keepthat legislation bottled up in conference committee even worse the hmo industry is trying to get legislation passed that would undo the progress that is being made on behalf of patients in state legislatures and in the courts the gop bill that recently passed the senate the nickles amendment is worse than no bill at all in fact it is an hmo protection bill not a patient protection bill would members like some proof of this let me tell the members about some of the things that have been documented in a recent article in smart money magazine in their july issue l 2000 consider the case of jim ridler it was shortly after noon on a friday back in august 1995

into his lane it hit jim head on it threw him more than 200 feet into a ditch he broke his neck his collar bone his hip severalribs all of the bones in both legs it ripped his triceps muscle clean through over the next 4 months after a dozen surgeries he still did not know whether he would ever walk again when he got a phone call from his lawyer who had started legal proceedings against the driver of that minivan who had swerved into his path that call that he got from his lawyer really shook him up im afraid ive got some bad news for you said his lawyer he told jim that even if jim won his lawsuit his health plan wanted to take a big chunk out of it that they had spent on his care youre joking right said jim nope said the lawyer jims health plan had a clause in its contract that allowed the hmo to stake a claim in his settlement a claim known in insurance as subrogation so i pay the premium and then something happens that i need the insurance for and they want their money back ridler asked incredulously the way i figure it my health insurance is just a loan well ridler eventually settled his lawsuit for 450 000 which was all the liability insurance available his health plan then took 406 000 leaving him after expenses with a grand total of 29 000 i feel like iwas raped by the system he says do my colleagues know what most people are not even aware that these subrogation clauses exist until they have been in an accident and try to recover from a negligent individual like the person who almost killed jim ridler originally subrogation was used for cases in

engineering degree it continued when he was selected as a member of nasas second class of nine astronauts he flew on two gemini missions setting a space fight endurance record on gemini 5 and commanded gemini 11 which docked with another spacecraft leading the way to the apollo missions he is best known though for the distinction of being the third man to walk on the moon apollo 11 captured the worlds imagination but the mission missed its landing site by several miles commander conrads mission proved that not only could we go to the moon but we can land on our target this mission goal was essential if any scientific exploration of the moon was going to take place unlocking the mysteries that the moon presents requires the ability to excavate specific sites apollo 12 and pete conrad proved this to be possible five years later when skylab was launched into orbit atop a saturn v rocket major damage was sustained which would have to be repaired in space if the microgravity laboratory program was to be useful pete conrad answered the call to duty on the first manned mission to the space station he and his crew mates repaired the damage in three exhaustive evas in addition to conducting a number of other experiments over the 3 weeks they spent aboard the station when he left nasa pete conrad was never far away his enterprising spirit took him into the fertile environment of the commercial space industry first with mcdonnell douglas and then on his own with universal space lines and several sister companies the visionary pete conrad recognized that it will be up to private industry to truly open the commercial markets of space so he created companies to design reusable launch vehicles and build ground tracking systems with the goal of making it easier cheaper and safer to put people and equipment into space through my work on the committee on science i had the pleasure of meeting pete conrad as a matter of fact most recently several months ago i have always been impressed by the force of his personality he seemed to exemplify the maxim of attitude is altitude at 5 feet 6 inches pete conrad personified this quip with his eye toward

thats a long one for me just last year he joked that he looked forward to his 77th birthday saying i fully expect that nasa will send me back to the moon as they treated senator glenn and if they dont do so why then i will have to do it myself the life of charles p conrad jr serves as an example of the patriotism and sense of adventure that sets the united states apart and makes us all as americans

first of all we should look at this motion to instruct there are several levels of clearance that are required for a motion to instruct to be in order and it has to deal with funding obviously in this motion to instruct it says that in resolving the differences between the two houses on the funding level for program management of the social security act so it meets that test level but then it goes on to say that through the funding mechanism they are supposed to choose a level that reflects a requirement on medicare choice organizations to offer a minimum contract period of 3 years there is no funding mechanism that would require or even allow a 3year contract under medicare medicare choice programs are funded for 1 year under the health care financing administration the amount that a medicare choice program receives is based upon a number of factors where it is located the cost of medical services in the area and most importantly the makeup of the beneficiaries that have signed up for that medicare choice program that is what is their age what is their medical condition all of these factors are taken into consideration when the level of reimbursement to the medicare choice plan is determined the difference by the medicare choice program of offering the statutory mandatory benefits is what the health care financing administration has determined to be its payment level if there are dollar differences between those two areas by law that plan must either offer additional benefits or that money has to be refunded back to the health care financing administration but it can only be done on a 1year basis under current law beneficiaries can sign up for a medicare choice program and leave the program that is the patient profile of a plan can change from year to year to year so it is nonsensical to think that a level of funding can produce a 3year contract it is also nonsensical to think that it can produce a set benefit package for a 3year period one of the reasons some of these plans are pulling out of areas is because they can no longer offer the benefits they had offered under their shrinking profit structure dictated and determined by the health care financing administration so make no mistake not only does this motion to instruct have no legal binding requirement but it is nonsensical it is germane it does affect the funding level but in no way does just

about this this is the nations second largest hmo in the hi1846 first place admitting yes we have been making medical decisions and then in the second place saying but you know what we have found that that is not cost efficient so we are going to allow the doctors to make the decisions remember the hmos have said during the debate we had here a couple of weeks ago oh no we dont make medical decisions we just make determinations of benefits and then they said but if you pass the legislation it is going to cost so much more premiums will go up and guess what one of the two cornerstones of

colleagues this is also a story a true story about a little boy we can see him here tagging on his sisters sleeve one night his temperature was about 104 or 105 degrees and his mother phoned the 1800 number for their hmo and said my baby needs to go to the emergency room he is really sick she got somebody thousands of miles away who said well i will only authorize you to take him to one emergency room and when the mother asked where it was the person said i do not know find a map it turned out that the hmo was about 60 or 70 miles away en route this little baby had a cardiac arrest if one is a mom and dad driving this little baby to the hospital members can imagine what that was like when they finally found it the mother leaped out of the car holding her little baby screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse came out started resuscitation they put in the i v lines gave him mouthtomouth resuscitation gave him the medicines and they managed to bring his life back all because that hmo did not have the common sense or decency to say if your baby isreally sick take him to the nearest emergency room because en route they passed three emergency rooms but they were not authorized by that hmo this little baby managed to survive but because he had that cardiac arrest he lost the circulation to his hands and his feet and he had to have both hands and both feet amputated why do 80 percentplus of the american public think that congress should pass an hmo reform bill a patient protection bill a real bill because their friends and neighbors have had problems just like some of those that i have shown the members a few years ago there was a movie as good as it gets in that movie helen hunt is talking to her friend jack nicholson and explaining how this hmo that they belong to will not properly take care of her son who has asthma then she let loose a string of expletives that i cannot repeat on the floor of congress but i can tell the members what happened in the theater that my wife and i were in it happened all across the country people started cheering and clapping and even standing up in applause because they knew the truth of that allegation no law has passed because the hmos have spent over 100 million lobbying against real patient protection legislation they have given generously to keepthat legislation bottled up in conference committee even worse the hmo industry is trying to get legislation passed that would undo the progress that is being made on behalf of patients in state legislatures and in the courts the gop bill that recently passed the senate the nickles amendment is worse than no bill at all in fact it is an hmo protection bill not a patient protection bill would members like some proof of this let me tell the members about some of the things that have been documented in a recent article in smart money magazine in their july issue l 2000 consider the case of jim ridler it was shortly after noon on a friday back in august 1995 and jim ridler then 35 years old had been out doing some errands he was returning to his home in a small town in minnesota on his motorcycle when a minivan coming from the opposite direction swerved into his lane it hit jim head on it threw him more than 200 feet into a ditch he broke his neck his collar bone his hip severalribs all of the bones in both legs it ripped his triceps muscle clean through over the next 4 months after a dozen surgeries he still did not know whether he would ever walk again when he got a phone call from his lawyer who had started legal proceedings against the driver of that minivan who had swerved into his path that call that he got from his lawyer really shook him up im afraid ive got some bad news for you said his lawyer he told jim that even if jim won his lawsuit his health plan wanted to take a big chunk out of it that they had spent on his care youre joking right said jim nope said the lawyer jims health plan had a clause in its contract that allowed the hmo to stake a claim in his settlement a claim known in insurance as subrogation so i pay the premium and then something happens that i need the insurance for and they want their money back ridler asked incredulously the way i figure it my health insurance is just a loan well ridler eventually settled his lawsuit for 450 000 which was all the liability insurance available his health plan then took 406 000 leaving him after expenses with a grand total of 29 000 i feel like iwas raped by the system he says do my colleagues know what most people are not even aware that these subrogation clauses exist until they have been in an accident and try to recover from a negligent individual like the person who almost killed jim ridler originally subrogation was used for cases in which care was provided to patients that had no health insurance but who might receive a settlement how"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "13 years ago i delivered the commencement address at my alma mater oklahoma state university i entitled that speech international trade opportunity or destruction which way america as i stand before my colleagues today we are going to answer that question we build economic opportunities for our children and grandchildren and provide opportunities to export american values for freedom of religion speech and human rights to china i want to emphasize five facts one we are in a global competitive world and we are not going back two 134 countries of the wto have already approved permanent trading relationships with china we are the only country that is lingering behind three china can already enter the united states markets that is why we have an 80 billion trade imbalance four this agreement will allow usthe usato enter chinas market of 1 3 billion people and will let us have the opportunity also to market the values that we believe in freedom of religion freedom of assembly freedom of speech and yes human rights fact five i am a grandfather i could step back and say why should i care this is not going to affect me but my colleagues are we going to give our children and our grandchildren the tools of opportunity to compete in this global economy or place them in an unfair position to maintain americas leadership in the world i stand in support of this legislation we must give our children and grandchildren the tools to compete in this world"], [0.5,

whaling worldwide and as a lifelong advocate for the environmental health of puget sound this recent event has been the cause of some amount of discussion and publicity in the region surrounding my district out of the 1 000 miles of coastline in washington state it was certainly an interesting coincidence that the body lodged right on the beach in front of my house the death of this gray whale should call our attention to those who would like to reverse the will expressed in congress and by an overwhelming majority of the american people who oppose allowing the hunting of whales particularly for commercial purposes as i have been predicting from the well of this house and across america for several years the push for resumption of worldwide commercial whaling is on in earnest and it is not about heritage it is all about money we have heard that a gray whale can be sold in japan for 1 million those who want to end the ban on commercial whaling have been using the pretext of restoring whaling rights to indigenous people to expand the scope of whaling worldwide but if we allow people to use the excuse of historic whale hunting for resumption of whale hunting worldwide you have got to remember many nations most nations with coastlines hunted whales japan and norway definitely would have as good as anybody an historic whale hunting opportunity japan and norway are the most notorious now for going ahead and hunting whales newsweek magazine reported april 17 information i have already given this body that japan has been quietly packing the international whaling commission with small nations willing to do their bidding willing to vote for the resumption of commercial whaling we are dangerously close to a renewal of the barbaric practice of commercial whaling to millions of americans including myself this is totally unacceptable when the clintongore administration last year financed the makah tribal whale hunt and colluded with the prowhaling nations of the international whaling commission our nations government lost its moral authority to lead the fight against killing whales for profit this was truly a tragedy whales were hunted almost to extinction in the late 1800s we must not allow the clock to be turned back topast days of barbarism republicans and democrats in this body must stand with the american people and stop this conspiracy against these magnificent creatures we must not return to commercial whaling"], [0.5, 0.0, 0, "2 decades ago i had the privilege of being first elected to serve here in the congress and one of the

calling beyond the beltway the republican freshmen are a diverse group coming from diverse backgrounds and representing equally diverse parts of america but despite that diversity we are all excited by some of the ijnovative reforms that we are seeing take place in state capitals throughout the land governors and legislative leaders republicans and democrats from states from california to new york are meeting their policy challenges in exciting innovative ways with our beyond the beltway project we are hoping as freshmen to open new doors for these leaders we know that for far too long federal rules and bureaucracies have held them back and smothered their efforts through unnecessary burdens and restrictions now the freshmen are reaching out to leaders like my own governor governor tommy thompson in an effort to help them unleash a whole new wave of creativity and innovation in state after state it is the freshmen who are initiating this project because even though we are members of congress we are very much still state legislators local officials and private sector small business persons at heart here specifically is what the beyond the beltway project will do the freshman class as a group have asked our governors legislative leaders directly and through the various associations to help us identify some of those federal rules and restrictions that are holding them back we want to turn these suggestions into an ongoing action agenda member by member and issue by issue we want to provide relief we are coming forward now with the beyond the beltway initiative because we have also introduced the first measure result from this new dialogue this legislation would direct each federal agency to develop an expedited review process for waiver requests as we know oftentimes states need federal approval or waivers to initiate their state programs if those plans deviate from the details of federal programs e0 0915 the idea of this legislation is that where a state has been granted a waiver on a particular program if another state seeks a similar waiver we believe that they should only have to go through a streamlined or expedited waiver review process we want to encourage the laboratories of democracy we want to encourage modeling we want to encourage benchmarking we want to encourage borrowing of ideas i would hope that my colleagues would join us in this expedited review bill and more importantly join the republican freshmen in developing beyondthebeltway ideas this is more than a shortterm project we hope it is the beginning of a new longer more open relationship between congress and the states instead of the governors coming to us on bended knee we are hoping to go to them for ideas and suggestions we want to turn them loose we believe that

laboratory skylab fell to the earth in a rain of blue red and orange fire over the indian ocean in australia i rise today to honor the memory of an astronaut who largely contributed to the success of that program charles pete conrad who died last thursday in a motorcycle accident at the age of 69 began service to his country as a unitedstates navy aviator after graduating from princeton with an engineering degree it continued when he was selected as a member of nasas second class of nine astronauts he flew on two gemini missions setting a space fight endurance record on gemini 5 and commanded gemini 11 which docked with another spacecraft leading the way to the apollo missions he is best known though for the distinction of being the third man to walk on the moon apollo 11 captured the worlds imagination but the mission missed its landing site by several miles commander conrads mission proved that not only could we go to the moon but we can land on our target this mission goal was essential if any scientific exploration of the moon was going to take place unlocking the mysteries that the moon presents requires the ability to excavate specific sites apollo 12 and pete conrad proved this to be possible five years later when skylab was launched into orbit atop a saturn v rocket major damage was sustained which would have to be repaired in space if the microgravity laboratory program was to be useful pete conrad answered the call to duty on the first manned mission to the space station he and his crew mates repaired the damage in three exhaustive evas in addition to conducting a number of other experiments over the 3 weeks they spent aboard the station when he left nasa pete conrad was never far away his enterprising spirit took him into the fertile environment of the commercial space industry first with mcdonnell douglas and then on his own with universal space lines and several sister companies the visionary pete conrad recognized that it will be up to private industry to truly open the commercial markets of space so he created companies to design reusable launch vehicles and build ground tracking systems with the goal of making it easier cheaper and safer to put people and equipment into space through my work on the committee on science i had the pleasure of meeting pete conrad as a matter of fact most recently several months ago i have always been impressed by the force of his personality he seemed to exemplify the maxim of attitude is altitude at 5 feet 6 inches pete conrad personified this quip with his eye toward enterprise and adventure though highly regarded as a truly terrific pilot he had a reputation as a jokester upon setting foot on the moon he cheered whoopee that may have been a small one for neil but thats a long one for me just last year he joked that he looked forward to his 77th birthday saying i fully expect that nasa will send me back to the moon as they treated senator glenn and if they dont do so why then i will have to do it myself the life of charles p conrad jr serves as an example of the patriotism and sense of adventure that sets the united states apart and makes us all as americans unique i am proud to have known him in life i honor him in death and i marvel as we all do at his legacy"]]}
