support programa program devised originally to stimulate production but which successfully has avoided the tighter governmental control applied to other major crops over these 40 years the production of soybeans in the united states has grown a crop of around 78 million bushels in 1940 to the alltime record crop of 2 26 billion bushels in 1979 while the 1941 legislation stimulated a rapid increase in production research and market development have been the second and third stage rockets which have given the soybean its meteoric rise to its present global orbit increasing new uses for soybean products through the years have provided a fertile field for the market development efforts which have caused sales to blossom around the world price support legislation was inspired early in 1941 by the war in europe and the immediate shortage of fats and oils in the united states which followed the japanese attack on pearl harbor the united states had been dependent on the pacific area for supplies of vegetable oils for soap paints and varnishes before world war ii the united states was importig twofifths of its fats and oils soybeans were not widely grown in this country although annual acreage had been increasing slowly for two decades less than 5 million acres of soybeans were harvested in 1940 even prior to pearl harbor official washington had become concerned about the impact of the growing war the reality of the situation caused a shift in attention from a policy of reducing the buildup of government stocks of several agricultural commoditiesnot soybeansto a policy seeking higher bngricultural production to meet wartime needs in conjunction with formulating a program for expanding agricultural production secretary of agriculture claude r wickard appointed interbureau coordinating committees for the basic commoditiescorn wheat cotton rice and tobacco an interbureau coordinating committee for fats and oils authorized on april 30 1941 recommended sponsoring a program calling for an expansion of soybean acreage on june 13 1941 agricultural conservation programs were announced to encourage increased production of soybeans for oil under the new provisions farmers were allowed to harvest an acreage larger than that harvested for soybeans in 1940 without penalties for exceeding acreage allotments ten days later farmers in states with minimum acreage requirements of soilconserving or erosionresisting crops received notice that soybeans harvested for beans for crushing were to be classified as an erosionresisting rather than soildepleting crop on july 1 1941 the steagall amendment was added to farm law raising the loan rates for basic commodities and directing usda to support the price at not less than 85percent parity on those nonbasic commodities including soybeans for oil for which the secretary of agriculture requested that production be increased thus the first government price support program for soybeans was inaugurated in 1941 on october 21 announcement was made of the first soybean price support loan to be offered by the commodity credit corporation nonrecourse loans were offered at a national average support level of 1 05 per bushel which was equal to 81 percent of comparable parity at the time of the support announcement the average farm price for soybeans was about 1 20 per bushel at the end of the 194142 marketing year the average farm price received for soybeans equalled 1 55 per bushel the 149 000 bushels placed under price support loans were redeemed before the end of the season soybean oil production increased from 564 million pounds in 1940 to 707 million pounds in 1941 in december 1941 price ceilings were placed on soybeans and were continued until the end of world war ii with the unitedstates entry into world war ii the need for a large increase in domestic oil production became even greater and the expansion of soybean production appeared to be the most feasible means of achieving this end in addition to the support prices the government established production goals starting with the 1942 crop the price support provision for the steagall commodites was raised from a floor of 85percent of parity to not less than 90 percent to remain in effect until 2 years after the termination of hostilities production during the war years more than doubledfrom 78 million bushels in 1940 to 193 million bushels in 1945 the price of soybeans during world war ii was contoiled within a rather narrow range by the price floor afforded by the support loan program and ceiling prices first on consumer products and later on raw agricultural products no acreage allotments or marketing quotas have ever been used to restrict the production of soybeans however federal programs for corn feed grains wheat and cotton often have included crosscompliance provisions applying to soybeans farmers participating in these programs sometimes were subject to restrictions on the acreage they

roosevelt spent 82 7 million john kennedy spent 210 5 million and jimmy carter spent 1 3 billion it took 186 years to raise the annual federal spending to a level of 100 billion it then took only 9 more years to double that figure to 200 billion four yeexs later federal spending reached 300 billion and in just 2 more years it reached the 400 billion mark federal outlays exceeded 500 billion in fiscal year 1980 600 billion in fiscal year 1981 and are projected to exceed 700 billion in fiscal year 1982 if this is not enough to convince the members of congress that a balanced budget is needed then maybe the realization that washington now spends 22 000 every second of the day will convince those members who do not favor a balancedbudget amendment the very fact that the amount of federal spending per average household increased 46 percent during the 4 years of the carter administrationfrom 5 026 in fiscal year 1976 to 7 329 in fiscal 1980 is alarming and not acceptable to the american taxpayer ii18319 without a spending limitation members of congress can accommodate one spending interest and gain political capital without reducing other spending programs and facing political disadvantages the political costs of excessive spending are deferred resulting in high inflation huge deficits and higher taxes while the political benefits of the spending are immediately appreciated by those affected by the program and the congessmen who support it a similar process and economic growth automatically generate more revenue without the need for a potentially unpopular tax increase taxpayers are the losers under the present system unlike the pressure groups the taxpayers are woefully unorganized and have varying interests when programs are examined on an individual basis the cost to each taxpayer is barely noticeable but when the costs of all the programs are added the impact is severe the requirements of balancing the budget and limiting the growth in spending will give the taxpayers an qual opportunity to influence spending discussions through the ballot box under the balancedbudget amendment congressmen will be forced to remain aware of public opinion because the votes for deficit spending and tax increases will be voted directly on those issues this should result in an examination of priorities when programs are considered the spending limitation will force congress to make choices which should lead to more efficient government the american people are demanding that congress balance the budget today we have the opportunity to carry out the will of the people and this is one congressman who will be voting to support the people of this country it is clear that the american budget process is seriously deficient it is also apparent that the public is concerned about federal spending and is willing to use the constitutional means to change the system in a september 1981 gallup poll 67 percent of those surveyed favored a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and restrict spending only 19 percent were opposed this support cut across traditional political lines the ultimate question then is not whether a constitutional amendment should 1

deficit spending and the limitation on spending will reduce inflationary monetary policies and allocate more financial resources to the private sector the provisions that would force open votes he

administration are currently deliberating and debating an issue of extreme importance to our national defense the decisions soon to be made concerning the mx missile system will affect all of our lives for decades to come i have carefully considered the testimony of numerous witnesses on the system in addition i have done extensive research or varlous approaches to deployment of our strategic retaliatory capabilities i fully endorse the concepts of the missile itself and i encourage the swift development and deployment of the weapon however i have serious concerns with the idea of land basing this icbm system particularly when it is compared with sea basing logic and commonsense dictate that we send the mx to sea i have five basic arguments which require us to look closely at the basingmode for this costly project first our primary strategic retaliatory forces are assigned the responsibility of deterring enemy nuclear attack by definition these forces will become a primary target themselves by deploying the missiles on the unitedstates mainland we are in effect inviting an attack on our homeland the initial radioactive fallout will follow the prevailing winds into the heavily populated and industrialized eastern states on the other hand if the retaliatory forces were deployed among the seven seas a first strike would by necessity be greatly diversified around the globe in unpopulated areas an enemy attack might boil water but will not fry people second the environmental impact of the mx system if land based has been inadequately addressed described as the worlds largest construction project the credibility of the environmental impact studies are greatly diminished but more importantly there has been no consideration given in the study process of the environental impact to the region of utahnevada following a nuclear strike against the missile system coinmonsense tells us that it would be devastating third the cost comparisons are enormous to construct a complex of 4 600 hardened shelters with 8 000 miles of roadway which is the equivalent in length to onequarter of our interstate highway system and to manufacture numerous monster transportation vehicles has been valued at near 100 billion at sea the same missiles on a wide variety of seagoing vessels not limited to submarines the proven hydra method of launch using the ocean itself as a launching pad has been estimated to be at the least 30 billion cheaper fourth if the mx is deployed in utahnevada as proposed there is a thin line corridor from those sites to their intended targets within the soviet union the requirement imposed upon the soviets in the way of radars and abm defenses is significantly lessened whereas the necessity of a 3600 requirement of defense forced upon them when these missiles encircle the unitedstatess r it is not only costly but most likely beyond their present technology fifth we have heard a lot of talk and testimony concerning the issue of communications we have been told by those promoting land basing that contact with the landbased system is much greater than if the missiles were out to sea i am not convinced thit such is accurate furthermore a soviet strike with highimpact explosions have the potential of disruption and confusing not only comnmunications with the retaliatory system but with the guidance controls of the missiles themselves such would not be the case if the missiles were distributed worldwide on the high seas i have therefore come to the conclusion that the political problems which are argued by tampering with the triad system do not compare wi th the advantages of national security offered by a sea basing mode i have so communicated my concerns to the president and to the secretary of defense who will soon make this gravely significant decision i ask my colleagues to look very closely at the options before us and to examine the facts which i have presented before we draw a bullseye

of 2 26 billion bushels in 1979 while the 1941 legislation stimulated a rapid increase in production research and market development have been the second and third stage rockets which have given the soybean its meteoric rise to its present global orbit increasing new uses for soybean products through the years have provided a fertile field for the market development efforts which have caused sales to blossom around the world price support legislation was inspired early in 1941 by the war in europe and the immediate shortage of fats and oils in the united states which followed the japanese attack on pearl harbor the united states had been dependent on the pacific area for supplies of vegetable oils for soap paints and varnishes before world war ii the united states was importig twofifths of its fats and oils soybeans were not widely grown in this country although annual acreage had been increasing slowly for two decades less than 5 million acres of soybeans were harvested in 1940 even prior to pearl harbor official washington had become concerned about the impact of the growing war the reality of the situation caused a shift in attention from a policy of reducing the buildup of government stocks of several agricultural commoditiesnot soybeansto a policy seeking higher bngricultural production to meet wartime needs in conjunction with formulating a program for expanding agricultural production secretary of agriculture claude r wickard appointed interbureau coordinating committees for the basic commoditiescorn wheat cotton rice and tobacco an interbureau coordinating committee for fats and oils authorized on april 30 1941 recommended sponsoring a program calling for an expansion of soybean acreage on june 13 1941 agricultural conservation programs were announced to encourage increased production of soybeans for oil under the new provisions farmers were allowed to harvest an acreage larger than that harvested for soybeans in 1940 without penalties for exceeding acreage allotments ten days later farmers in states with minimum acreage requirements of soilconserving or erosionresisting crops received notice that soybeans harvested for beans for crushing were to be classified as an erosionresisting rather than soildepleting crop on july 1 1941 the steagall amendment was added to farm law raising the loan rates for basic commodities and directing usda to support the price at not less than 85percent parity on those nonbasic commodities including soybeans for oil for which the secretary of agriculture requested that production be increased thus the first government price support program for soybeans was inaugurated in 1941 on october 21 announcement was made of the first soybean price support loan to be offered by the commodity credit corporation nonrecourse loans were offered at a national average support level of 1 05 per bushel which was equal to 81 percent of comparable parity at the time of the support announcement the average farm price for soybeans was about 1 20 per bushel at the end of the 194142 marketing year the average farm price received for soybeans equalled 1 55 per bushel the 149 000 bushels placed under price support loans were redeemed before the end of the season soybean oil production increased from 564 million pounds in 1940 to 707 million pounds in 1941 in december 1941 price ceilings were placed on soybeans and were continued until the end of world war ii with the unitedstates entry into world war ii the need for a large increase in domestic oil production became even greater and the expansion of soybean production appeared to be the most feasible means of achieving this end in addition to the support prices the government established production goals starting with the 1942 crop the price support provision for the steagall commodites was raised from a floor of 85percent of parity to not less than 90 percent to remain in effect until 2 years after the termination of hostilities production during the war years more than doubledfrom 78 million bushels in 1940 to 193 million bushels in 1945 the price of soybeans during world war ii was contoiled within a rather narrow range by the price floor afforded by the support loan program and ceiling prices first on consumer products and later on raw agricultural products no acreage allotments or
