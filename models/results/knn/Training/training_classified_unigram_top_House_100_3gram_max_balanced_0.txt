introducing companion legislation today so that the house may concur with the senates views on the embargo and so that the house will be able to go on record on this important issue the united states and iran have a precarious relationship on the one hand we depend on the crude oil that iran exports and on the other we are engaged in escalating military and diplomatic confrontation with iran in

more than 11 percent of total unitedstates oil imports it is difficult to explain why we are continuing to do business with iran when they pose a direct threat to united states military personnel

predominant interest of the people in northern and northwest iowa is agriculture and thus far the voice of agriculture has not been heard in this debate let me be a little more specific right now this bill primarily targets four countriestaiwan korea japan and west germanywhich accounted in 1985 and 1986 for over 32 percent of all the unitedstates farm export sales what we are doing with this bill is pitting one sector of the economy against the otherpitting the farmers against the laborers the supposed purpose of the gephardt provision is to open up foreign markets however what it will do is force hostile retaliation from our trading partners the gephardt amendment puts unitedstates trade on a oneway street going in the wrong direction we do need a tough trade policy but with the ways and means provisions we already have it with this amendment we are asking for disastrous results the gephardt provisions are not going to open up foreign markets they are going to send a hidden messsage to americans saying that we are going to stop agriculture exports let me be a little bit more specific about this right now currently people who are representing interests that produce and process soybeans in this country are very worried about an arrangement that the european common market is currently entering into that would make a 90percent tariff and tax against unitedstates soybean products the only country that has not participated in that agreement is germany the economic minister of germany has publicly stated that with the gephardt amendment the germans are inclined to enter into this agreement and consequently reduce the amount of soybean exports to the united states the gephardt amendment forces unitedstates agriculture exports to be stopped to force this congress to adoptthe only choice it will have will be to adopt a mandatory supply management policy for american agriculture now there is a lot of talk in this body about this not being a trade bill this being a jobs bill and i would agree with every member who feels that way but it has been calculated by the unitedstates department of agriculture that for every billion dollars of retaliation 30 000 jobs are lost i would argue that a job saved in the city versus a job lost in the country is still a net gain of zero finally just let me say to reiterate something that mr gephardt said yesterday and again very eloquently he said that 80 percent of our problem is our own failing it is our own inability to make good products it is our own inability to produce goods of high enough quality and low enough price the quality of our agriculture products is high and we all know that the price is low the time is right to sell the legislation is wrong i urge my colleagues to support the michel substitute"],

difficult vote for all of us none of us likes to support a war or intervene in another countrys revolution but i firmly believe that if it had not been for contra aid in the past that nicaragua would not have participated in the arias peace plan i also believe that the sandinistas without pressure from within would have been a threat to the other central american countries particularly el salvador
