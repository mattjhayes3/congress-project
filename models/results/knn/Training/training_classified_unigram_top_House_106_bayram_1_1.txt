union i rise today to commemorate this anniversary and to celebrate the resources and treasures of the 2nd congressional district historically the great state of california is most often associated with the gold rush northern california was the main destination of those in search of quick wealth the banks of the feather river yielded great riches to those who were in the right place at the right time but the precious metal that caused a rush to the west was not the only treasure that california possessed young settlers whose dreams had not materialized in the gold fields soon turned to the fertile central valley and envisioned golden acres of grain today those acres are covered with fruit trees rice fields and almond and walnut orchards as the valley continues to yield its agricultural treasure making california the leading agricultural economy in the world others looked at the golden promise in the vast forests their labor provided the lumber for the growing towns and cities of northern california a tremendous renewable resource to the american people our forests provide materials for homes and businesses as well as endless recreational opportunities and habitat for unique plant and animal species some entrepreneurs recognized that there were other ways to gather gold than simply panning in a streambed they opened dry goods stores banks and hotels women found that they could earn a living utilizing their household skills cooking and cleaning for miners who couldnt california was born a land of golden opportunities and to this day she continues to call to those willing to take a risk in order to improve their own lives many came to california for only a visit but stayed a lifetime the specious skies majestic mountains and rushing rivers of northern california stirred their souls while her fertile valleys gentle climate and endless opportunities captured their imagination yes gold fever may have lured early settlers here but even though the

precipitating the korean war unprepared south korean or rok forces and the handful of americans on the ground were incapable of halting this swift and brutal assault in a matter of days the badly battered unitedstates and rok units had been pushed back to a tiny toehold on the southern tip of the korean peninsula it was only with determination and unbelievable courage that american forces together with south korean and allied troops were able to push back the attacking north korean army the breakout of the pusan perimeter the inchon landing battles like pork chop hill and heartbreak ridge the terrible fight against overwhelming odds at the frozen chosin reservoir on these and countless other unnamed battlefields we beat back the invaders the korean conflict reflected the absolute determination of the united states to halt the spread of tyranny and totalitarianism but the cost was high the war that north korea started resulted in 39 000 unitedstates deaths and over 100 000 wounded and severely undermined unitedstates relations with russia and china it took decades for our south korean ally to recover in the socalled democratic peoples republic of korea the dprk there is certainly a very different and distorted interpretation of the events that occurred 50 years ago incredibly according to the north korean news agency quote the unitedstates instigated the rok army to start a surprise armed invasion of north korea on june 25 1950 it was commanded by the unitedstates military advisory group end of quote the newscast goes on to explain that in precipitating this unprovoked attack the unitedstates supposedly indiscriminately carpet bombed throughout north korea these lies from north korea newscasts are not from some ancient historical record no this was the broadcast in the last several weeks it is worth noting that this slanderous pack of lies was broadcast right after the recent historic meeting between south korean president kim dae jung and north korean leader kim jong il it was broadcast the day after the united states had announced the delivery to north korea of an additional 50 000 tons of grain and about the same time that north korea was reinventing history secretary of state albright was announcing that north korea is not a terrorist state or even a rogue state but merely a state of concern this member points this out because of the recent changes in perception regarding north korea on the verge of collapse the hermit kingdom is at least attempting to give the impression that it is reaching out to south korea and to the west if north korea is in fact sincere in its peaceful overtures that certainly would be a dramatic positive development however it would be premature to assume that the dprk has irrevocably reformed its behavior it would be naive in the extreme to believe that a few gestures constitute a reversion of 50 years of violently confrontational behavior and terrorism and it would be foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary he must continue to view north korea as a terrorist state and to regard the korean peninsula as the place on the globe where american forces might again be attacked and a tragically costly war begun again"], [0.0, 0.0, 0, "a couple of different points that i want to make here one is

security but when it comes to each bill it is always well we really need this we really need that we have been trying to save a little bit of money in each one because a number of us strongly felt that while everybody talks about the need to stay within the budget agreement the fact is that the money we had on the table for laborhhs for interior and veterans was not sufficient and that every side was kind of doing a winkwink and saying well we are trying to try to stay within the caps and within the budget agreement knowing we were not working towards that every dollar we save in this appropriations bill the agriculture appropriations bill is going to be able to be used for those programs that the gentleman from wisconsin and others have said they are concerned about and will help us preserve social security that is the real tradeoff yes it will be difficult for members offices to live under a freeze which is in effect a reduction but we also gave each member of congress flexibility to move their funds around and most members do not even spend their full account furthermore this is another round in my opinion of pick on the majority whip the plain truth of the matter is that the majority and minority are both getting the same amount of money in this we reduced in this agreement the amendment that will be offered the money going to leadership not by a lot but by some this amendment does not really please anybody but at least it moves the ball forward and reduces some funds overall the minority leader the gentleman from missouri gets the same amount as the majority whip he can either give it to the minority whip or do it elsewhere the fact is that early on for many different reasons in the majority side the whips office was disproportionately cut in its budget that is why the majority is choosing to put the money in the whips office the minority has the same amount of funds what is good for one side is good for the other we have also reduced the committee spending we need to lead by example every dollar we can save in the operations that support congress in our own operations in all of the many organizations here we can put into educating our children into the health concerns raised by the gentleman from california in the difference diseases we can put it into our national defense that is one of the problems here we have just seen all of our secrets in our military offensive and defensive pc tentially be at risk to china at the same time unless we spend more money in defense we are completely vulnerable if we spend more money there it

can still be held liable for the full amount in a class action suit with joint and several liability because they are held as a defendant proportional liability i think is a much better range if someone touches a problem and makes it better they should not be held liable for the full amount just because they happen to be the deep pockets just because they happen to have the cash on hand to take the money from these companies that they should be investing in new products so that they compete on a global marketplace and instead put it into litigation into settlement into attorneys fees

they never could have conceived of could have used it comes in and messes it up and yet the group that is actually innocent can be held liable for the total amount that is what this amendment is it holds companies who are trying to improve it in addition to that this makes companies reluctant to fix the problem because if they fix the problem if they come in and help a computer system and it is still not 100 percent functional if they happen to be the deep pocket and they are a defendant under joint and several liability they can be liable for the whole thing what that means is the problem is not getting fixed or if they are getting fixed the larger companies are going to the smaller companies and having them write off indemnities and the like that just do not make any sense in the

things over television the media and other areas if someone could easily avoid damage by taking a simple step which he or she should be aware it is perverse to allow that person to avoid taking those steps and to suffer damage and then to sue a third party for compensation when they should have known and probably knew because they were not officially notified this is a bad substitute"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "well one can negotiate with the plo i am going to use the balance of the time to discuss managed care reform legislation that we are going to be debating here on the floor next week i appreciate the majority leader and the speaker of the house for setting up this debate for next week the rumors are that we will be using the bipartisan consensus managed care bill as the base bill that is the bill that i support it is a strong managed care reform bill we are uncertain at this time as to what type of rule we will have i would request that we have a clean rule in other words a rule that is limited to patient protection legislation and does not involve tax matters for which one could then get into discussions about offsets and other difficult problems well humor sometimes shows that the public is aware of a problem i remember a few years ago my wife and i went to the movie as good as it gets many people saw this movie it featured helen hunt and mr nicholson it was about a waitress played by helen hunt she had a young son who had asthma in one of the lines of the movie which i cannot repeat here on the floor helen hunt with expletive waste language described her hmo as preventing her son who had asthma from getting the type of care that he needed the forcefulness of her statement caused audiences not just to laugh but in many instances to stand up and clap and cheer as occurred in the movie theater that my wife and i attended this movie indicating that the public understands that there is a problem in the delivery of health care by hmos it is not so funny when we look at real life cases we have headlines and this probably is directly related to the humor or at least the understanding of the statement by helen hunt in the movie as good as it gets we have a headline here from the new york post hmos cruel rules leave her dying for the doc she needs just like the hmos cruel rules would not allow helen hunts son in the movie to get the asthma care that he needed so he was also ending up in the emergency room how about this headline from the new york post what his parents did not know about hmos may have killed this baby which brings us to an issue in hmo reform that we have been working on which deals with an issue that started this debate several years ago now before i came to congress i was a reconstructive surgeon in des moines iowa i still go overseas and do charitable surgery so i am still involved with the practice of medicine in some respects but a few years ago it became known that hmos were writing contracts in which they said that before a physician could tell a patient all of their treatment options they would first have to get an okay from the hmo these are called gag rules that then spawned a number of cartoons here we have one and i will read this for my colleagues because it is hard to see we have a physician sitting at his desk and he says your best option is cremation 359 fully insured the patient is sitting there saying this is one of those hmo gag rules isnt it doctor or how about this one the physician is sitting talking to his patient the physician says i will have to check my contract before i answer that question now think of that now say one is a woman one has a lump in ones breast and one goes in to see ones doctor he takes ones history does ones physical exam then he says excuse me i have to leave the room he goes out in the hallway he has to get on the phone phone the hmo and says mrs soandso has a lump in her breast she has three treatment options one of which may be expensive is it okay if i tell her about all three treatment options is that bizarre is that ridiculous does that strike at the heart of a patient having confidence that his physician is going to tell him all of his treatment options well it was not such a funny story for a real life patient this woman in the middle of this picture is dead today because her hmo prevented her from knowing all of her treatment options this story is fully documented in time magazine from about 2 years ago or how about the problem that one has had withhmos in delivering emergency care frequently hmos if one has gone to an emergency room will deny payment let me give my colleagues an example you wake up in the middle of the night you have crushing chest pain you are sweaty you know that the american heart association says this could be a sign that you are having a heart attack so you go to the emergency room right away like you should because if you delay you may be dead you have the tests run and the electrocardiogram shows it is normal but instead you have severe inflammation of your stomach or your esophagus so the hmo ex post facto says see the ekg was normal you were not having a heart attack you are stuck with the bill man because you did not need to go next time somebody thinks about that and then delays going to the emergency room when they should under what a common layperson would say is truly an emergency they may not get a second chance so here you have a cartoon that sort of deals with this you have a medical reviewer saying cuddly care hmo my name is joan how may i help you you are at the emergency room and your husband needs approval for treatment he is gasping writhing eyes rolled back in his head does not sound all that serious to me the medical reviewer at the hmo says then she says clutching his throat turning purple uhhuh have you tried an inhaler he is dead well then he certainly does not need treatment does he then the medical reviewer from the hmo turns to us and says gee people are always trying to rip us off that is black humor that is black humor i will tell my colleagues but that rings a bell with a lot of people who have trouble with their hmos here you have a picture from a tv show a long time ago you have a nurse here she is on the phone and she is saying chest pains let me find the emergency room preapproval forms how about a real life example of an hmo patient having significant problems with their hmo during an emergency this young woman who is strapped to a board was hiking not too far from washington she fell off a 40foot cliff she was lying at the base of the cliff semicomatose with a fractured skull a broken arm and a broken pelvis fortunately her boyfriend had a cellular phone and they got her airlifted into an emergency room she was in the icu on morphine drip for a long time but she is doing okay now but then she got a refusal of payment from her hmo they would not pay for her hospitalization do my colleagues know why they said well she did not phone ahead for preauthorization i mean think of that she was supposed to know that she was going to fall off the cliff break her skull break her arm fracture her pelvis maybe her hmo thought that as she was laying at the bottom of the cliff she should wake up with her nonbroken arm pull a cellular phone out dial a 1800 number and say hello i just fell off a cliff i broke my pelvis i need to go to the emergency room and then when she was in the hospital on a morphine drip in the icu after it became silly when the hmo was confronted with their denial they said well she was in the hospital and she did not notify us in the first couple of days so now we are not going to pay for it on that reason well she was finally able to get some help from her state ombudsman but many people who have health insurance particularly through their employers would not have that option so what we have in the bill that we are talking about the patient protection bill the bipartisan consensus managedcare reform bill is a provision that says look if an average person has what they would say truly is an emergency they get to go to the emergency room and the hmo has to pay how about some of these plan guidelines the hmos use to determine medical necessity remember these remember when the hmos were talking about drivethrough delivery of babies or mandating only 24hour stays in the hospital boy they were embarrassed by that but under federal law they can define medical necessity anyway they want to and even if a patient suffers an jury they have no recourse under federal law here we have a cartoon with dr welby and he is saying she had her baby 45 minutes ago discharge her i mean imagine that line on that program years ago people would have thought that was absolutely crazy and yet that is what the hmos have mandated in some cases here we have a cartoon that says maternity hospital and then we have the drivethrough window with the caption now only 6minute stays for new moms and the person at the window says congratulations would you like fries with that and look at the mother her hair is all out like this the baby is crying and then there is a little thing that says looking a little like scalding coffee situation in the corner now this may be a little bit funny but it was not funny to a woman by the name of florence corcoran whose baby was sent home within the mandated 24 hours the baby ended up dying of an infection that would have been discoveredhad the baby been allowed to stay in the hospital just a little bit longer i was talking a little bit about the hmos ability under federal law for employer plans to define medical necessity any way they want to well i have taken care of a lot of children with this birth defect a cleft lip and a cleft palate there are some hmos out there that are defining medical necessity as the cheapest least expensive care think of that for a minute they can deny any treatment that is not the cheapest least expensive care so for this child with this birth defect instead of authorizing a surgical correction of the roof of this childs mouth that would enable the child to be able to learn to speak correctly not to mention not having food go out of his nose that hmo under federal law as it currently exists could say no that is not the cheapest care we are going to prescribe a little piece of plastic to shove up in that hole in the roof of the mouth what is called an obturator of course will the child be able to learn to speak properly with that no but quality does not matter to the hmos when they are defining care as the cheapest least expensive care and under federal law they could do that with impunity we need to fix that here we have another cartoon we have the operating table we have the doctors the hmo bean counters and anesthesiologist at the head of the table and the doctor says scalpel the hmo bean counter says pocketknife the doctor says suture the hmo bean counter says bandaid the doctor says let us get him to intensive care and the hmo bean counter says call a cab they can do that under current federal law because they can define medical necessity as the cheapest least expensive care here is a cartoon that says remember the old days when we took refresher courses in medical procedures one doctor is saying to a colleague as they walk in the hmo medical school and the course directory in the hmo medical school is first floor basic bookkeepingand accounting second floor advanced bookkeeping and accounting third floor graduate bookkeeping and accounting now look i think some hmos do a reasonable job and they should be a choice for people to have and some hmos are truly trying to do an ethical job as well but the hmo field is very competitive particularly on prices and there are some bad apples out there that are cutting corners too close and they are able to do that because this federal law that i was talking about that passed 25 years ago put nothing in place of state insurance oversight it took the oversight on quality away from the states not a very republican idea it took it away from the states put it in the federal arena but then placed nothing in its place in terms of some standard rules on fairness to patients or on quality here we have another cartoon that says the hmo bedside manner time is money is the sign on the edge of the bed bed space is loss turnover is profit and the health care provider is saying after consulting my colleague in accounting we have concluded youre well enough now go home and here we have a patient with his arms in traction looking like he has a fractured face with his jaw in traction the bottom line should not be the bottom line if it is going to interfere with quality health care here we have another cartoon where the patient is saying to the hmo physician do you make more money if you give patients less care the hmo spokesperson says thats absurd crazy delusional the patient then says are you saying im paranoid and the answer is yes but we can treat it in three visits it reminds me of the wellknown joke about the three physicians who died and went to heaven one of them was a neurosurgeon and he said to saint peter you know i fixed people who were in accidents and had blood clots on their brains and i saved their lives and saint peter said enter myr son the next person is an obstdtician and she says to saint peter a have delivered hundreds of thousands of babies and i have given a lot of free care and saint peter says enter my daughter and the last one is an hmo medical director who says well saint peter i was able to save millions of dollars by denying care and getting people out of the hospital earlier and saint peter says enter my son for 3 days here we have a cartoon that is the hmo claims department and the hmo bureaucrat says no we dont authorize that specialist then she says no we dont cover that operation and then she says no we dont pay for that medication and then apparently there is some strong language or something as she is listening and then she looks rather cross and says no we dont consider this assisted suicide now look if all of this seems a little off the wall let me just say that it has reallife consequences when hmos are not accountable for their medical decisions and is there anyone that doubts that hmos are making medical decisions every day not by the hundreds not by the thousands but by the tens of thousands every day they are making medical decisions and under federal law they are not liable for the bad results the negligent results of those decisions that could result in loss of life or limb now if an insurance company sells a policy as an individual and they are under state insurance oversight that insurance company does not have that kind of legal liability shield but under this antiquated federal law it is the only group in this country other than foreign diplomats that have legal immunity for the decisions that they are making the automobile manufacturers do not have that kind of legal immunity the airplane manufacturers or the airlines do not only the group that provides health care for employers is totally immune from the consequences or responsibility of their decisions so let me tell my colleagues about a case where this makes a real difference where an hmo made a medical decision i have here a picture of a little boy who is tugging his sisters sleeve he is about 6 months old a few weeks after this picture was taken he is awake at about 3 in the morning with a temperature of about 105 and he is sick and as a mother can tell he is really sick and he needs to go to the emergency room so mom does what she should do she phones that 1800 number for that hmo and says my baby jimmy is sick he has a temperature of 104 105 and he needs to go to the emergency room and this voice from some distant place certainly not familiar with her state says well all right i will authorize you to take little jimmy to this hospital and mom says well where is it and the reply from the medical bureaucrat is well i dont know find a map well it turns out that it is a long ways away but mom and dad know that if they take little jimmy to a different hospital then their hmo is not going to cover any of the cost so they wrap up little jimmy and start the trek halfway through the trip they pass three emergency rooms with pediatric care facilities that could have taken care of little jimmy but they cannot stop they are not medical professionals but they do know if they stop at those unauthorized hospitals they would be stuck with potentially a huge bill so they keep driving before they get to the hospital that has been designated little jimmy has a cardiac arrest and he stops breathing and his heart stops beating imagine that while mom and dad are driving mom is trying to keep this beautiful little boy alive they come screeching finally into the emergency room mom leaps out screaming help me help me help my baby a nurse runs out and does mouthtomouth resuscitation they start ivs they give him medicines they pound his chest and they get him back alive but because of that medical decision that that hmo made they do not get him back whole because of that circulatory arrest he ends up with gangrene of both hands and both feet and they have to be amputated here is little jimmy after his hmo treatment sans hands and sans feet under federal law the hmo which made this medically negligent decision is liable for nothing zero nada because they have already paid for his amputations and that is all they are liable for is that fairness is that justice this little boy will never play basketball i would remind the speaker of the house that this little boy will never wrestle i would remind my colleagues that some day when he grows up and he gets married he will never be able to caress the cheek of the woman that he loves with his hand i would remind the hmo people who always say do not legislate on the basis of anecdotes like little jimmy adams that this little boy if he had a hand and you pricked his finger it would bleed we need justice i am a republican i have stood on this floor and i have voted for responsibility for ones ac1 tions if a murderer or a rapist is convicted they should suffer the con sequences when we passed the welfare reform bill we said it is your responsibility if you are ablebodied and you could work it is your responsibility to get some education we will help you with that but you need to get out and get a job and support your family republicans are big on responsibility but look are my fellow republicans going to say to the hmos when they are responsible for a little boy losing his hands and feet that that hmo should not be responsible and furthermore we republicans have said you know what we should devolve power back to the states let us get these things back to the states this was a federal law that took this oversight away from the states in the name of justice we should say that if an hmo makes this type of decision that results in this type of injury they should be responsible for that that is only fair i will tell my colleagues what those bottomline hmos that are cutting the corners too close will be much more careful so we will not see injuries like this a judge reviewed this case the judge in reviewing the hmos decision making on this said that their margin of safety was razor thin i would add to that as razor thin as the scalpel that had to cut off little jimmys hands and feet what we are talking about next week when we have this debate is an issue that has a lot of importance to people every day around the country we will have an opportunity to correct a wrong to right a wrong the bill as it was written in erisa 25 years ago did not anticipate the changes that we have seen in the management of health care by hmos where they are now managing medical decisions i am a physician i would never argue that if i had made a negligent decision that had resulted in an injury like this that i as a physician should be immune from the consequences i do not know any physicians who would make that argument i do not know an airplane manufacturer that if it is negligent and a plane goes down and 200 people are killed would make an argument on this floor that anyone would vote for that would give them legal immunity for their negligent actions i just do not see it well we are going to have an opportunity to debate several bills next week there is a difference in those bills there is a bill that my good friends the gentleman from oklahoma"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "well here we are again with a difficult rule we will see whether we can work this out i think i need to spend a couple of minutes talking about why this bill should pass blue cross blue shield of iowa controls the health care of 98 percent of the hospitals and 90 percent of the doctors one insurance company controls the access and health costs of 60 percent of insured oregonians market competition in texas is all but gone twentyfour competing companies have compressed into four megamanaged care companies sixty percent of the pittsburgh market is controlled by one plan more than 50 percent of the philadelphia market is controlled by one plan each plan has maintained its dominance by virtue of an agreement not to compete in each others territory one insurance company dictates health care in over half of washington state since i came to congress and closed my practice in 1994 there have been 275 mergers and acquisitions of health plans there are now seven managed health care plans and blues control the cost and access of the majority of people in this country what does that mean that means if one is a provider a doctor and that hmo controls 50 or 60 percent of their patients and they present a contract and say take it or leave it and that doctor has a child in college they are making mortgage payments how do they turn them down when they have a contract clause that says medical necessity means the shortest least expensive or least intense level of care as defined by us or maybe they say like this blue cross blue shield contract of iowa where the health plan shifts responsibility to physicians for the health plans breaches of confidentiality that they release any liability for disclosure made by the company or how about the gag clauses that companies want providers to sign on to a lot of providers just do not have a choice i have had a lot of republican colleagues when we have had our managed care debate say just let the market work if we get to a vote on this vote yes because this will let the market work"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "we are about 1 week from having at least 1 day of debate here on the floor of the house of representatives on managed care reform and hopefully we will pass the bipartisan consensus patient protection bill of 1999 there has been a lot of talk about what is in this bill so i want to go over some of the specifics and then i want to focus a little bit about some of the miscommunication that has been put out about the bill in regards to its liability section since i was largely responsible for writing the liability section in a previous bill first of all the bipartisan consensus patient protection bill of 1999 deals with access to care i think the opponents to this legislation want to focus on one issue and that is the liability provisions but there is a lot in this bill this is a comprehensive bill that is important to the people of this country and it is part of the reason why over 300 organizations patient advocacy groups consumer groups provider groups have endorsed this bill what are some of the provisions in the bill that make this an excellent bill first of all access to emergency services individuals should be assured that if they have an emergency those services will be covered by their plan the bipartisan consensus bill says that individuals must have access to emergency care without prior authorization in any situation that a prudent layperson would regard as an emergency what does this mean well this means that if for instance an individual wakes up in the middle of the night and has crushing chest pain is hot and sweaty and that individual happens to remember an ad put on tv by the american heart association that these could be signs an individual could be suffering from a heart attack that that individual can go to the nearest emergency room pronto to be treated that is what a prudent layperson would define as a potentially impending fatal heart attack now the problem that we have had is that a lot of hmos will say that if the tests show that the patient is actually not having a heart attack even though the symptoms indicated that they were if the tests after the fact show that the electrocardiogram was normal that maybe the individual was suffering severe inflammation of the esophagus or the stomach they say well see the patient was not really having a heart attack so they did not really need to go the problem with that is that when that kind of attitude gets around people then start worrying that they are going to be stuck with a big bill and they may then delay getting the needed care that they need in an expeditious fashion the next time it happens it may really be a heart attack the individual may delay taking action and then they may not make it to the emergency room that is the type of thing that we are looking at fixing in this bill we did this for medicare by the way this should be a noncontentious issue we have already passed that provision for medicare why can we not apply it to everyone in this country who buys insurance especially those who take up hmo insurance how about the provisions for specialty care patients with special conditions should have access to providers who have the expertise to take care of them the bipartisan consensus bill allows for referrals for people to go outside of the plans network for specialty care at no extra cost for the enrollee if there is no appropriate provider in that health plan this is really important to a lot of consumer groups a lot of patients with certain types of chronic care that need a specialist a person with rheumatoid arthritis for instance chronic care referrals for individuals who are seriously ill or require continued care by a specialist a plan should have a process for selecting a specialist who can be the regular doctor for that patient so that every time a patient has to go and see their cancer doctor they do not have to get a referral from the health plan how about womens protections the bipartisan consensus bill provides for direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists for services childrens protections the bipartisan bill ensures that the special needs of children are met including access to pediatric specialists children are not just little adults before i came to congress i was a reconstructive surgeon i took care of a lot of children with birth defects they have special needs if a child has cancer that child ought to have access to a pediatric oncologist continuity of care patients should be protected against disruptions in care because of a change in the plan or a change in the providers network status let us say a woman is a couple months from delivering she has been followed by her obstetrician for twothirds of her pregnancy all of a sudden the plan says well we are changing the plan this guy or this woman is no longer in the plan that is a significant disruption in care how about somebody who is dying and they have been followed or taken care of by a certain physician there are certain benefits to continuity of care in terms of quality of care and we ought to make sure that people who are right in the midst of complicated treatments do not have their care disrupted by a plan arbitrarily changing their physicians clinical trials this is part of the reason why for instance the american cancer society has endorsed the bipartisan consensus managed care patient protection bill accessto clinical trials can be crucial for treatment of an illness especially if it is the only known treatment available plans under this bill must have a process for allowing certain enrollees to participate in approved clinical trials and the plan must pay for the routine patient costs associated with those trials that is in our bill drug formularies prescription medications are not one size fits all for plans that use a formulary beneficiaries should be able to access medications that are not on that formulary when the prescribing physician dictates choice of plan choice is one of the key elements in consumer satisfaction with the health system the bipartisan consensus bill would allow individuals to elect a point of service option when their health insurance plan did not offer access to nonnetwork providers any additional costs would be borne by the patient this is a fair compromise people should be informed about decisions about their health plan options and they can only know what their plan is doing if their plan provides them with sufficient information this bill requires managedcare plans to provide important information so that consumers can understand their plans policies their plans procedures their plans benefits and requirements i mean a lot of opponents to this legislation say oh just let the free market work well the free market is not really working because most people do not have a choice for their health plans most employers will select one plan most frequently on the basis of cost and then they will say to the employee take it or leave it so it is not like the employee is getting that choice people who are denied care ought to have a reasonable utilization review process when a plan is reviewing the medical decisions of its practitioners it should do so in a fair and rational manner this bill lays out basic criteria for a good utilization review program with physician participation in the development of the review criteria the administration by appropriately qualified professionals timely decisions within 14 days for ordinary care up to 28 days if the plan requests additional information within the first 5 days or 72 hours if they need an urgent decision they should have the ability to appeal those decisions and they should be able to appeal in a fair process within the plan and they ought to have an external appeal so that if at the end of their utilization review or their internal appeal within their plan and the plan is still saying no we are not going to give you this care and everything you have read about it and your own physician is telling you this is prevailing standards of care and you can be harmed without it then an individual ought to have access to an external independent body with the capability and authority to resolve disputes for cases involving medical judgment by the plan the plan should pay the costs of that process and any decision should be binding on the plan and that is what is in our bill if a plan refuses to comply with the external reviewers determination the patient should be able to go to federal court to enforce that decision and there could be a penalty and that is in our bill i am going to talk about liability though if there is an injury there are certain things in this bill that to me as a physician are absolutely essential for good health care consumers should have the right to know all of their treatment options a few years ago i gathered together about 50 examples of contractual language from hmos some plans try to limit the amount of information that you can receive from your doctor let me give my colleagues an example of how this can work let us say a woman would come to me with a lump in her breast she would give me her history i would examine her breast under those types of gag rules and those contract clauses that some hmos have put out before i could tell this woman what her three treatment options were one of which might be more expensive than the other i would be obligated to first phone the health plan and say mrs soandso has this problem can i tell her about all three treatment options i mean can you think of anything that would be worse in terms of a patient wondering whether they are being leveled with by their doctor i mean i am not saying that a plan cannot write a specific exclusion of coverage into their plan let us say that a plan says we are not going to cover liver transplants well that is a decision thatthat em ployer and that health plan is making i would hope that an employee would have a choice to choose another plan let us say that a patient comes in to see me as a physician and their treatment option is a liver transplant that is the only thing that might save their life whether their plan pays for it or not that patient has a right to know that that treatment is available that could save their life now the plan may not like the patient to know that because a patient might be unhappy about that but the patient has the right to know that that is in our bill there should be prompt payment of claims health plans should operate efficiently there should be paperwork simplification and finally let us get back to the issue of responsibility as a republican i have voted many times for legislation that would make people and entities responsible for their actions i know most of my republican colleagues on this side of the aisle feel the same way if a criminal commits a murder that person should be responsible for his actions we have passed several pieces of legislation that involve the death penalty for that type of behavior that is responsibility we passed the welfare reform bill a few years ago we said look if you are ablebodied and you can work we will give you some help some education but ultimately it is your responsibility to go out and support your family that is responsibility we have a situation here where because of a law that was passed by congress 25 years ago employer health plans are not responsible for their medical decisions that can result in injury that sort of seems unbelievable does it not i mean the only health plans in the country that have that kind of exemption from liability from responsibility for injury that they can incur on a patientbecause of their decisions are employer group health plans the members of congress receive their insurance through what is called the federal employee health benefit plan do you know what if our plans are not providing care then a member of congress could sue that health plan if that health plan resulted in injury to a congressmans family because it is not an erisa plan it is not one of those employer plans other government employees have the same right church groups for instance that provide health benefits for their employees those health plans are not free of any responsibility when an insurance company sells a health policy to an individual and is under state insurance regulation they are not free of responsibility for injuries that can result from their medical decisions it is only these plans that by a 25yearold federal law gave an exemption for liability that they can cause injury to a patient they can arbitrarily define what medical necessity is and you have no recourse other than to recover the cost of the treatment that was not provided which by the time you could get through that procedure might mean that you are dead let me give my colleagues an example of what i am talking about this is a little baby that i have treated before i treated him for cleft lip palate a birth defect the standard treatment for this is surgical correction both of the lip and of the palate there is a functional reason for that without that surgical correction if you eat food comes out of your nose and you cannot speak correctly and speech is an absolutely essential part of our culture so all insurance companies that i know of in the past traditional insurance companies do not consider correction of this birth defect do not consider correction of this birth defect a cosmetic procedure this is a reconstructive procedure but under this federal law that i am talking about the erisa law the employee retirement income security act from about 5 years ago an employer plan can define medical necessity as the cheapest least expensive care and they could say no we are not going to authorize a surgical repair for this birth defect we are just going to give this little kid a piece of plastic to shove up into the roof of his mouth something like an upper denture and maybe that will help keep the food from coming out of his nose and do my colleagues know what they would have no legal recourse to challenge that hmo that is federal law that allows them to do that you could say that medical decision you are making that medical judgment of medical necessity is wrong it does not fit any of the proscribed norms for treatment and it results in injury to this child because if he does not get his palate corrected really by about the age of one he may have a speech impediment the rest of his life and do my colleagues know what they would have no legal recourse under that federal law that is wrong that is not justice let me give my colleagues another case we have here a little boy who is tugging on his sisters sleeve this picture was taken shortly before he was 6 months old when he was 6 months old one night about 3 in the morning he had a temperature of about 105 and he was pretty sick and this beautiful little boy looking so sick caused his mother to phone the hmo and say my little boy jimmy is sick he has a temperature of 104 105 i need to take him to an emergency room she was on a 1800 number somebody thousands of miles away who said well you know when we look at your state this was in georgia i can authorize you to go to this emergency room and the mother said well that is fine but where is it well i do not know look at a map it turns out that the authorized emergency room was 70some miles away clear on the other side of atlanta georgia the mother knew that if she went and took him to another emergency room that is not authorized they would be stuck with a great big hospital bill so she wraps up little jimmy ma and dad get in the car and they start their trip 3 in the morning and about halfway there they pass three hospitals that have emergency rooms and great pediatric care facilities but they do not stop because they have not received authorization from that hmo reviewer who made a medical judgment over the phone the medical judgment was jimmy is okay to travel 70 miles on a prolonged ride before they get to the authorized hospital little jimmy has a cardiac arrest his heart stops he is not breathing picture mom trying to resuscitate him dad is driving like crazy they finally pull into the emergency room entrance mom leaps out of the car with little jimmy screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse runs out gives him mouthtomouth resuscitation they start the ivs they pound his chest they resuscitate him and they get him back and they manage to safe his life except they cannot quite save all of little jimmy because he had that cardiac arrest he ends up with gangrene of both hands and both feet and both hands and both feet have to be amputated this is a consequence of the medical judgment the medical decision that that hmo reviewer at the end of a thousandmile 1800 number made a judge reviewed this case of course under erisa the plan is liable for nothing other than the cost of the amputations but a judge reviewed the case and he came to the conclusion that the margin of safety for this hmo was as he put it razor thin i would add to that as razor thin as the scalpel that had to amputate little jimmys hands and feet the opponents to this legislation who want to maintain this type of legal immunity they refer to cases like james adams as anecdotes they say oh dont legislate on the basis of anecdotes i look at this little boy and i think is this an anecdote i mean this little boy is never going to play basketball i tell the speaker of the house this little boy will never be able to get on the wrestling mat this little boy when he grows up and he marries the woman that he loves will never be able to caress her face with his hand this anecdote that the hmos say we should not legislate on if he had a finger and you pricked it he would bleed this is not just that a health plan can make that type of medical judgment and not be responsible for the injury that results plans should be more careful than that the liability part is the enforcement mechanism to ensure that plans are more careful now look the point of showing little jimmy adams is not necessarily to say that we need a lawsuit my point is this we need a mechanism to prevent this type of tragedy from happening and we need the encouragement to the hmos to follow that process and the process would work like this if somebody has an illness and they have a denial of care by their hmo and they go through that internal appeals process and they are still not satisfied they can take that to an independent panel which would make a determination on medical necessity we know from where this type of process has been set up that more than half of the time the independent appeals boards agree with the health plan on the denial of care but 50 percent of the time they agree with the patient and if they agree with the patient and they tell them the health plan you should provide this treatment and the health plan does that then under our bipartisan common sense compromise bill that health plan is free of any punitive damages liability because they are simply following the independent external appeals recommendation that is something that would be available for all health plans whether they are erisa plans or plans that are selling to individuals that is a fair compromise on this issue but if they do not follow those recommendations and you end up with an injury like this then the plan is going to be liable under that states laws just as if they had sold that policy to the adams family on their own as individuals rather than through their employer i hear an awful lot from the opponents to this legislation that you are just going to make the employers liable well i would refer colleagues from both sides of the aisle to the actual bill to page 97 we say that health plans are not exempted from liability health plans are not but as long as the employer has not entered into that decisionmaking by that hmo then the employer is not liable i have here a legal brief from the law firm of gardner carton douglas which discusses this liability provision in some detail for the norwooddingell bill let me just summarize what this says on the liability provisions this says managed care industry miscommunications on this liability provision do not present an accurate analysis of the plan sponsor protections in the bill the hmo industry claims the bill would subject plan sponsors i e the employers to a flood of lawsuits in state courts over all benefits decisions under their group health plans and suggest that plan sponsors would be forced to abandon their plans all of this is incorrect for the following reasons this is just a summary first almost all lawsuits would not be against plan sponsors under current erisa preemption law suits seeking state law remedies for injury or wrongful death of group health plan participants are already allowed in numerous jurisdictions those cases show that these suits are normally brought against the hmo not against the employer the employers are generally not involved in treatment decisions that lead to a plan participants to the employees injury or death ordinary benefit decisions such as whether to reimburse particular medical expenses are not affected by our bill second the plan sponsor exposure would be limited if a plan sponsor i e the employer exercises discretion in making a benefit claim decision and that decision results in injury or wrongful death section 302 a in our bill makes an exception to erisa to allow a state claim however to recover a plaintiff the patient or his family must first prove that the sponsor exercised discretion which resulted in the injury or death and then must prove all elements of a state law cause of action based on the sponsors conduct in making the decision on that particular claim the plaintiff must have a viable state law cause of action because our bill only creates an exception to erisa preemption it does not create a new cause of action third the statutes plain meaning limits plan sponsor liability the provisions in our bill that protect plan sponsors would be interpreted under the supreme courts wellestablished plain meaning analysis such an analysis supports the bills clear intention to continue to preempt any state law liability suits against employers that do not involve an exercise of discretion by them in making a decision that results in injury or death other types of discretionary plan sponsor action would not be affected and would not be subject to state law liability claims finally the private sector health care would not be destroyed the limited legal exposure of employers under this bill will not cause them to abandon group health plans the experience of retirement plans and nonerisa plans group health plans support that conclusion plan sponsors would not need to abandon all control over group health plans to remain protected i include the foregoing document in its entirety for the record from gardner carton douglas date september 27 1999 subject liability of plan sponsors under the norwooddingell bill you have asked us to analyze whether section 302 a of h r 2723 the bipartisan consensus managed care improvement act of 1999 the bill could subject employers or others such as labor organizations who sponsor group health plans plan sponsors to potential liability under state law for injuries or deaths resulting from coverage decisions under group health plans that they sponsor as part of our analysis you asked us to consider letters that have been prepared by some law firms for lobbying groups that are opposed to the bill the managed care letters the managed care letters do not focus on the central purpose of section 302 a of the bill that purpose is to fill an unintended gap under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa by creating accountability for managed care organizations mcos and others who make treatment decisions or provide services for participants in group health plans subject to erisa the gap results from judicial interpretations of erisa which prevent the application of state law remedies that otherwise would redress an injury or death caused by improper administration of a group health plan case law rules which attempt to define the limits of erisa preemption in these circumstances are complex and differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the managed care letters shift attention from addressing this problem by characterizing section 302 a as an employer liability provision based on our analysis of section 302 a such a characterization is incorrect"], [1.0, 1.0, 0, "tonight as i sit in the chamber with our colleagues it will be my 14th opportunity and

are trampled upon by oppressive regimes he waged an unrelenting crusade against the forces of atheistic communism and continues to preach the message of life hope and love amid the oppressive tide of the culture of death pope john paul is encyclical the gospel of life evangelium vitae reminds all of usespecially those in public servicethat the gift of human life is so precious so full of dignity that it must remain inviolable and be defended against all manner of violence the pope writes in that important document that this is what is happening also at the level of politics and government the original and inalienable right to life is questioned or denied on the basis of a parliamentaryvote or the will df one part of the peopleeven if it is the majority this is the sinister result of a relativism which reigns unopposed the right ceases to be such because it is no longer firmly founded on the inviolable dignity of the person but is made subject to the will of the stronger part and elsewhere in evangelium vitae pope john paul ii states in unambiguous terms abortion and euthanasia are thus crimes which no human law can claim to legitimize there is no obligation in conscience to obey such laws instead there is a grave and clear obligation to oppose them by conscientious objection in the case of intrinsically unjust law such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia it is therefore never licit to obey it or to take part in a propaganda campaign in favor of such a law or vote for it in the kingdom of god that civilization of life which john paul ii has so fervently sought to build there is no place for the systematic killing of unborn children my family and i have had the awesome privilege of meeting the holy father in newark new jersey in the crowd in 1979 at new yorks shea stadium and most recently in guatemala i have personally witnessed and been inspired on numerous occasions by his power that comes from being so rooted in god and so devoted to the

troops invaded south korea pouring across the 38th parallel and precipitating the korean war unprepared south korean or rok forces and the handful of americans on the ground were incapable of halting this swift and brutal assault in a matter of days the badly battered unitedstates and rok units had been pushed back to a tiny toehold on the southern tip of the korean peninsula it was only with determination and unbelievable courage that american forces together with south korean and allied troops were able to push back the attacking north korean army the breakout of the pusan perimeter the inchon landing battles like pork chop hill and heartbreak ridge the terrible fight against overwhelming odds at the frozen chosin reservoir on these and countless other unnamed battlefields we beat back the invaders the korean conflict reflected the absolute determination of the united states to halt the spread of tyranny and totalitarianism but the cost was high the war that north korea started resulted in 39 000 unitedstates deaths and over 100 000 wounded and severely undermined unitedstates relations with russia and china it took decades for our south korean ally to recover in the socalled democratic peoples republic of korea the dprk there is certainly a very different and distorted interpretation of the events that occurred 50 years ago incredibly according to the north korean news agency quote the unitedstates instigated the rok army to start a surprise armed invasion of north korea on june 25 1950 it was commanded by the unitedstates military advisory group end of quote the newscast goes on to explain that in precipitating this unprovoked attack the unitedstates supposedly indiscriminately carpet bombed throughout north korea these lies from north korea newscasts are not from some ancient historical record no this was the broadcast in the last several weeks it is worth noting that this slanderous pack of lies was broadcast right after the recent historic meeting between south korean president kim dae jung and north korean leader kim jong il it was broadcast the day after the united states had announced the delivery to north korea of an additional 50 000 tons of grain and about the same time that north korea was reinventing history secretary of state albright was announcing that north korea is not a terrorist state or even a rogue state but merely a state of concern this member points this out because of the recent changes in perception regarding north korea on the verge of collapse the hermit kingdom is at least attempting to give the impression that it is reaching out to south korea and to the west if north korea is in fact sincere in its peaceful overtures that certainly would be a dramatic positive development however it would be premature to assume that the dprk has irrevocably reformed its behavior it would be naive in the extreme to believe that a few gestures constitute a reversion of 50 years of violently confrontational behavior and terrorism and it would be foolish to pretend that north korea no longer deserves to be labeled as a terrorist state in recent days a historic meeting has occurred between the north and south korean leaders kim dae jung went to pyongyang and promised to open the spigots of foreign assistance although at the norths insistence it is called economic cooperation that is the south gives and the north cooperates by accepting in return the north has promised to permit some longawaited family reunions of those who have been torn from their families 50 years ago from a public relations standpoint north korea scored a remarkable victory kim jong il was described as cherubic in the new york times and amazingly senior administration officials called him courageous and visionary but the question remains has kim jong i1 and the totalitarian elite that rules north korea made a commitment to peace when one examines north koreas record on weapons of mass destruction missiles and support for terrorism it is not at all clear that it has made a permanent commitment to peace despite the 1994 agreed framework that was touted as capping the north korean nuclear threat there is ample evidence that pyongyang continues to pursue an undeclared nuclear program an unclassified 1998 cia report concludes that north korea possesses between 6 and 12 kilograms of plutonium which it acquired before the yongbyon nuclear reactor was shut down in 1995 this weaponsgrade material has not been accounted for in addition press reports from publications such as janes intelligence review suggest the dprk has continued its efforts to acquire uranium enrichment technologies in 1998 a secret underground facility was discovered that certainly seemed like it was related to nuclear activities i hope that north korea has made a change but we need to see exactly what it has done before we reach any new conclusions about its intentions according to the congressional research service russian and former east german nuclear scientists are operating in north korea in contrast to the time when the 1994 agreed framework was signed north korea seems on the threshold of being able to attack the united states with a missile that could deliver chemical biological or possibly nuclear weapons it has produced deployed and exported missiles to several countries of great concern to the united states the dprk has launched a threestage taepodong 1 missile and continues to develop a larger longerrange missile the taepodong 2 not only does north korea now possess a missile capable of reaching unitedstates soil but it is clear that it intends to sell such fully developed weapons systems to the highest bidder according to a 1999 national intelligence estimate the proliferation of mediumrange ballistic missilesdriven primarily by north korean no dong saleshas created an immediate serious and growing threat to unitedstates forces interests and allies and has significantly altered the strategic balances in the middle east and africa while individuals in the executive branch argue that north korea has agreed to halt its missile program it is important to note that the north only has agreed to a moratorium on flight tests design rocket motor tests production and sales to other socalled states of concern can continue it was just last week at negotiations that took place between unitedstates and north korean officials that the dprk flatly refused to halt development of missiles instead they made it clear that development of new and more capable missiles will continue in addition north korea demanded 1 billion to impose a moratorium on new missile exports unfortunately this is all too typical of the norths pattern of threats and extortion north korea insists that it is not a terrorist state but its past and even recent actions certainly suggest otherwise the dprk has remained a haven for the terrorists of the japanese red army faction pyongyang regularly has infiltrated training and resupply teams into south korea and japan other actions include border violations infiltration of armed saboteurs and spies hijacking kidnapping assassination and threats against media personnel and institutions to finance these terrorist activities north korea uses counterfeit unitedstates currency recently a japanese red army terrorist was caught while traveling in southeast asia with a north korean diplomatic passport this terrorist was carrying over 100 000 in counterfeit currency in short north korea has not to date behaved like a country wishing to join the international family of nations former secretary of defense william perry a truly outstanding public servant was tasked with reviewing unitedstates policy toward north korea he concluded that north korea had two options the first option would be the path of engagement if the dprk really sheds its rogue behavior the united states should respond with a reduction of sanctions and gradual extension of normal political and commercial activity if however the dprk chooses the path of confrontation the perryrecommended policy is that the united states and our allies must meet the norths aggressiveness with firmness resolve and military might it must be clear that america would respond in that fashion it is far too early to tell which path the dprk will choose it is possible that they will opt for peaceful engagement america and south korea obviously hope that it is the path the dprk will choose but we must end the cycle of extortion which the north has successfully pursued with the united states one insubstantive summit meeting does not guarantee such a sea change in behavior this nation must maintain its resolve to preposition 100 000 troops in the asiapacific area with 37 000 on the korean peninsula we must resist the temptation to throw even more money at the north without demonstrable progress in reducing the threat and we must continue to aggressively pursue the development of ballistic missile defenses capable of defending this nation against the emerging ballistic missile threata threat made evermore immediate by the north korean missile development program and its missile exports this member genuinely hopes that north korea will one day become merely a state of concern but until this member sees ample evidence to the contrary

budget agreement we all go out home and say we want to save all this money for social security but when it comes to each bill it is always well we really need this we really need that we have been trying to save a little bit of money in each one because a number of us strongly felt that while everybody talks about the need to stay within the budget agreement the fact is that the money we had on the table for laborhhs for interior and veterans was not sufficient and that every side was kind of doing a winkwink and saying well we are trying to try to stay within the caps and within the budget agreement knowing we were not working towards that every dollar we save in this appropriations bill the agriculture appropriations bill is going to be able to be used for those programs that the

freeze which is in effect a reduction but we also gave each member of congress flexibility to move their funds around and most members do not even spend their full account furthermore this is another round in my opinion of pick on the majority whip the plain truth of the matter is that the majority and minority are both getting the same amount of money in this we reduced in this agreement the amendment that will be offered the money going to leadership not by a lot but by some this amendment does not really please anybody but at least it moves the ball forward and reduces some funds overall the minority leader the gentleman from missouri gets the same amount as the majority whip he can either give it to the minority whip or do it elsewhere the fact is that early on for many different reasons in the majority side the whips office was disproportionately cut in its budget that is why the majority is choosing to put the money in the whips office the minority has the same amount of funds what is good for one side is good for the other we have also reduced the committee spending we need to lead by example every dollar we can save in the operations that support congress

politicians today the house stands on the verge of sending the senate a bill that may very well terminate the f22 program on one side we have a carefully planned smoothly executed plan by politicians to scrap the fighter on the other side we have every general in the pentagon telling us our national security will suffer a fatal blow if we choose to give up air dominance in the next century in a letter to congress last week secretary of defense william cohen told us that canceling the f22 program means we cannot guarantee air superiority in future conflicts six former secretaries of defense have echoed secretary cohens words calling the f22a essential program that must be fully funded make no mistake about it if we cancelthe f22 we are making a decision to stake the lives of american soldiers on inferior equipment because some in congress think they know more about air warfare than the united states air force ironically canceling the f22 wont even accomplish its stated goal of saving money secretary cohen has told us the alternative to the f22 an upgraded f15 already over 25 years old will cost the same as the f22 but will not provide air dominance the secretary has also told uscorrectlythat not only will the joint strike fighter or jsf be unable to fill the air superiority role it will also be unable to handle its strike role without f22 support this is the legislative equivalent of rejecting a cadillac in order to buy a yugo for twice the price the jsf is not was never contemplated to be and cannot be made into the f22 it is not an airsuperiority fighter it is a subsonic tactical fighter that goes into a conflict after the f22 establishes air dominance the jsf cannot itself establish air dominance in september of 1939 neville chamberlain told the british people to go home and rest easy because he hadpurchased peace for our time the following september an unprepared great britain began a fight for its life with nazi germany we must not make a longterm mistake for a shortterm gain by canceling the f22 we must not allow our easy victory in kosovo to lead us to mistakenly assume we will always have air superiority again the facts are clear firstthis decision may very well end the f22 program by raising future costs so high we will not be able to restart it later secondwithout the f22 american forces will to a certainty be outgunned by the next generation of missiles and aircraft already nearing production by three nations russia france and sweden each of which is ready to use them or sell them to the highest bidders thirdby giving up air superiority we are encouraging our enemies to attack us and ensuring that young americans will pay on the battlefields of the future only a few short years away in short we will have rejected the wisdom of george washington who told congress o be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace the ancient chinese military strategist sun tzu said the same thing two thousand years ago when he wrote that ictorious warriors win first and then go to war while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win if congress kills the f22 program we will pay dearly later for ignoring this sage advice now"]]}
