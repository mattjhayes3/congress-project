convenient for whoever is speaking the fact is that central america has been a place of great desperation for a long long time the somozas dominated nicaragua for 40 years america conveniently extended support at times when indeed we should have been pressuring for change that did not come through democratic and republican administrations over too many years in my first session in 1979 that debate was raging and america had made a decision to push the somozas out in order to provide hope freedom and opportunity economic growth and change and suddenly after that crisis we began to give

today is not its purpose or goal there is a demonstrable need for home health care in this country we need to address it and we need to do something about it but we need to do it properly this bill has never seen 1 hours worth of hearings in nor any examination by the cor mittees of the congress who have developed the expertise in drafting health care legislation and in providing secure funding for it no one knows if the bill before us is financially sound i wouldnt oppose a bill on an important subject like this on merely procedural grounds but there is good reason for a sound process and this bill coming as it does directly to the floor from the pen of the sponsor without any intervening examination has bypassed every opportunity this institution provides to be sure that legislation we pass will work as it is intended to let me refer members to the mess congress made of things many years ago when in a laudable effort to help senior citizens it increased the social security benefitsonly to find that it increased them too much we could not afford to pay benefits that generous without breaking the social security system so congress went back and tried to correct its mistake and presto the notch years were created in short congress was trying to do a good thing but it did not take the time to do it right we are about to do that all over again there is legislation in the senate to address the need for home health care there is legis lation being developed in the house to deal with this very same issue they are proceed ing through the regular process and they will come before this bodywith a track record of analysis that can demonstrate that it will be workable we should let those efforts proceed but trying to rush a measurehowever well meaningthat has such a high probability to proving to be a huge disappointment and even a financial disaster is simply counterproductive we could be witnessing right now as we debate this billthe creation of a new notch that will plague us and those we repre sent for a long time i was not here when we created the last one i do not want to be here at the creation of a new one therefore let me say again we must not only do good but we must do it right this is a good thing but it is being done in a very wrong way i do not want to be responsible for offering hope to millions of americans in need of home health care only to have to dash the hopes when we discover that the program was not well thought out or properly financed that turns hope to despair fortunately our choice is not between passing this bill or doing nothing our choice is between passing this bill with all the unanswered questions that accompany it or waiting long enough for a well crafted and thoroughly understood measure to be reported to us from the committees with special experi ence and understanding of this type of legislation the common sense choice is to do this right that means having the courage to vote against a bill with

district shut its doors there was no notice given to the workers i was angry i thought the actions of the ownership of that plant were despicable and i thought what congress should do is pass legislation that requires that notice be given to the workers then somewhere in the back of my mind i heard the voice of an old priest that used to rattle around the halls of i oras college in dubuque ia he said the road to hell is paved with good intentions i cannot mimic him very well but the fact of life is that in this case the road to hell is paved with good intentions we all want to help workers and some think that by passing this legislation we will but i suggest to my colleagues the opposite is true the fact is that when layoffs occur they usually occur because of a lost customer or they occur because of commodity price changes let us say the price of corn has gone up and the ethanol plant no longer has a market or maybe there is a new competitor the sponsors of the legislation say those are unforeseeable and we are not going to have a problem with that but the fact of life is that if notice is not given by those employers they are going to be in a position where they face litigation so the bottom line is that this bill prohibits a private employer from imposing a necessary partial layoff in order to save jobs for other workers and that is what is wrong with the legislation at its most basic but there is another thing that is wrong with it besides the fact that it costs jobs and that is that it is directed toward small businesses the large employers are already covered most of them by collectivebargaining contracts and the rest of them ladies and gentlemen will thumb their noses at this legislation look at what happens in canada the large companies every other week put in their paycheck a notice which says in 30 days or 60 days we will be closing down and it occurs week after week after wcek and they get around the bill but the smaller businesses are not sophisticated enough to do that so it provides no protection from the large but it hurts the small so i suggest to my colleagues if they want more plant closings vote for this bill

becoming increasingly apparent to all i suggested that he consider changing his vote but his simple answer was that he was locked in to his anticontra position i walked away deeply disappointed by that response i fear that there are at least some members of this house who may be planning to vote against contra and who believe in their hearts that support for this aid request is prudent at this

amendment that is proposed or the position that is proposed by the gentleman from california mr dannemeyeri will accomplish nothing and the reason for that is very simple georgetown and the district of columbia have reached an agreement in resolution of their dispute georgetown is quite happy with that agreement they have written all and sundry who have inquired about it stating that the entire georgetown community faculty administrators students alumni all are happy with the agreement and that regardless of what congress does as to the armstrong amendment georgetown will not change the stance it now has which it considers educationally sound that position as this bill moves along will be offered by the gentleman from california who will exert his right under our rules after we have receded to offer a motion which will take preference to concur with an amendment as i understand it that amendment that motion to concur with an amendment will fully spell out georgetowns right to express its views on any question in full keeping with its first amendment rights both freedom of speech and freedom of religion georgetown is perfectly happy with that solution to the problem so what basis at all is there for us to be trying to legislate with respect to the district of columbia i would finally like to appeal to my colleagues simply on the basis of protecting the prerogatives of the house of representatives the fact of the matter is that an amendment of the kind we are being asked to recede to here cannot be passed during ordinary house consideration of an appropriation bill because it permits an appropriation to take effect only if someone else takes some nonministerials act and that kind of an amendment has consistently been ruled out of order as legislating on an appropriation bill if we are going to accept these kinds of amendments when they are offered on the senate side where the senate binds itself by no such rule then we are continually going to be putting ourselves at a disadvantage with respect to the senate today it is only the district of columbia authorizing committee that is hurt by the action and i know members around here unlesss they come from the metrop~olitan area do not pay a lot of attention to the workings of that committee but i say to every other member of the house on every other authorizing committee maybe it is the district of columbia committee this time whose ox is being gored but the same can be done in the way of legislation on appropriation bills in the senate on any other appropriation bill that comes

he would learn that the cr makes further continuing appropriations for the several departments agencies corporations and other organizational units of the government for the fiscal year 1988 and for other purposes and he would probably conclude that cr must stand for continuing resolution but he would be baffled if he tried to determine from the joint resolution or the report just how much money was being appropriated the report does explain that 768 5 billion of the 1 1 trillion outlay budget is uncontrollable leaving only 271 3 billion to annual discretionary action and it does explain just how much is being saved from various baselines and budget allocations the report even informs us that the committee heard 4 188 witnesses and produced 94 220 pages of hearing record but nowhere in the report or resolution can there be found the total amount being appropriated let alone a comparison of budget authority and outlays for the various subcommittee bills which are merely referenced in subsections 101 a m such cost estimates are only required by house rules to be included in the reports on general appropriations bills and not in the reports on crs one must look elsewhere in unofficial publications and summaries to find such figures variously reported as being between 587 billion and 598 billion but then whats 11 billion among friends even the three appropriations bills which have not been considered by the housedefense foreign operations and agricultureare merely referenced by bill number members will have to look elsewhere to find out what those measures contain and yet these three bills alone reportedly total some 330 billion in budget authority roughly 55 percent of the 598 billion total ba in the cr the house is nevertheless being asked to swallow these whole without amendment despite reports that the bills are laced with pork and major foreign policy provisions objectionable to the administration moreover nowhere can there be found the total amount being appropriated for some 25 programs under 10 acts which have not been authorized or included in the 13 appropriations bills already reported or passed in the house while all these programs are being carried forward at fiscal 1987 levels the report fails to include the funding levels for 4 of the 25 programs again a check elsewhere reveals that the total funding for these four programs alone is roughly 166 million the 25 programs are all bunched together in subsection 101 n and reportedly add up to around 3 billion then we have a hodgepodge of miscellaneous provisions in subsections

pacific is wellknown to date they have only been moderately successful the united states must seriously undertake to respond to the defense needs of the islands by developing bilateral security commitments i believe such arrangements would be received as positive and constructive and consistent with the spirit of the treaty of rarotonga the united states has been derided by some for its decision to not sign the protocols although announcing at the same time that the united states would abide by the principles of the treaty of rartonga it is the soviets who should be castigated for signing yet stating that they would not abide by the treaty and the resolution now does pursuant to an amendment i offered the soviet unions reservation which accompanied their signature amounts to nuclear blackmail against the countries party to the treaty the soviets stated that if any signatory country admitted a nuclear capable vessel into their territory they would no longer honor the protocol pledging not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons i for one take strong exception to such a coercive position and expect that those stated reservations will be removed by the soviet union the resolution has been amended to clearly state that the soviet reservation has the effect of posing a nuclear threat to nations party to the treaty which freely engage in peaceful cooperation with the united states i want to acknowledge the efforts of our many friends in the south pacific who worked to develop the treaty of rarotonga it was a formidable task to formulate a treaty that would provide for a zone of peace in the pacific and be compatible with the need for strong deterrence until our world is truly free and nuclear free i also want to commend my colleagues who have shown so much interest in pacific issues a considerable amount of time has been spent on this and other islandrelated legislation that is vitally important to the united states the pacific is changing at an accelerating pace it is in the interest of the united states to stay in tune with the many changes in the pacific and to take a responsive and leading role in maintaining a stable region for the

has never seen 1 hours worth of hearings in nor any examination by the cor mittees of the congress who have developed the expertise in drafting health care legislation and in providing secure funding for it no one knows if the bill before us is financially sound i wouldnt oppose a bill on an important subject like this on merely procedural grounds but there is good reason for a sound process and this bill coming as it does directly to the floor from the pen of the sponsor without any intervening examination has bypassed every opportunity this institution provides to be sure that legislation

district shut its doors there was no notice given to the workers i was angry i thought the actions of the ownership of that plant were despicable and i thought what congress should do is pass legislation that requires that notice be given to the workers then somewhere in the back of my mind i heard the voice of an old priest that used to rattle around the halls of i oras college in dubuque ia he said the road to hell is paved with good intentions i cannot mimic him very well but the fact of life is that in this case the road to hell is paved with good intentions we all want to help workers and some think that by passing this legislation we will but i suggest to my colleagues the opposite is true the fact is that when layoffs occur they usually occur because of a lost customer or they occur because of commodity price changes let us say the price of corn has gone up and the ethanol plant no longer has a market or maybe there is a new competitor the sponsors of the legislation say those are unforeseeable and we are not going to have a problem with that but the fact of life is that if notice is not given by those employers they are going to be in a position where they face litigation so the bottom line is that this bill prohibits a private employer from imposing a necessary partial layoff in order to save jobs for other workers and that is what is wrong with the legislation at its most basic but there is another thing that is wrong with it besides the fact that it costs jobs and that is that it is directed toward small businesses the large employers are already covered most of them by collectivebargaining contracts and the rest of them ladies and gentlemen will thumb their noses at this legislation look at what happens in canada the large companies every other week put in their paycheck a notice which says in 30 days or 60 days we will be closing down and it occurs week after week after wcek and they get around the bill but the smaller businesses are not sophisticated enough to do that so it provides no protection from the large but it hurts the small so i suggest to my colleagues if they want more plant closings vote for this bill

amendment that is proposed or the position that is proposed by the gentleman from california mr dannemeyeri will accomplish nothing and the reason for that is very simple georgetown and the district of columbia have reached an agreement in resolution of their dispute georgetown is quite happy with that agreement they have written all and sundry who have inquired about it stating that the entire georgetown community faculty administrators students alumni all are happy with the agreement and that regardless of what congress does as to the armstrong amendment georgetown will not change the stance it now has which it considers educationally sound that position as this bill moves along will be offered by the gentleman from california who will exert his right under our rules after we have receded to offer a motion which will take preference to concur with an amendment as i understand it that amendment that motion to concur with an amendment will fully spell out georgetowns right to express its views on any question in full keeping with its first amendment rights both freedom of speech and freedom of religion georgetown is perfectly happy with that solution to the problem so what basis at all is there for us to be trying to legislate with respect to the district of columbia i would finally like to appeal to my colleagues simply on the basis of protecting the prerogatives of the house of representatives the fact of the matter is that an amendment of the kind we are being asked to recede to here cannot be passed during ordinary house consideration of an appropriation bill because it permits an appropriation to take effect only if someone else takes some nonministerials act and that kind of an amendment has consistently been ruled out of order as legislating on an appropriation bill if we are going to accept these kinds of amendments when they are offered on the senate side where the senate binds itself by no such rule then we are continually going to be putting ourselves at a disadvantage with respect to the senate today it is only the district of columbia authorizing committee that is hurt by the action and i know members around here unlesss they come from the metrop~olitan area do not pay a lot of attention to the workings of that committee but i say to every other member of the house on every other authorizing committee maybe it is the

was being appropriated the report does explain that 768 5 billion of the 1 1 trillion outlay budget is uncontrollable leaving only 271 3 billion to annual discretionary action and it does explain just how much is being saved from various baselines and budget allocations the report even informs us that the committee heard 4 188 witnesses and produced 94 220 pages of hearing record but nowhere in the

whole without amendment despite reports that the bills are laced with pork and major foreign policy provisions objectionable to the administration moreover nowhere can there be found the total amount
