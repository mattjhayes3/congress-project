of some of you i agreed with chairman dixon to the new position the conference committee has taken this position on its face applies a standard on abortion to the district that is more restrictive than that applied to all 50 states and all four territories the new standard before us today goes well beyond the hyde amendment for medicaid abortion funding that applies to my district as to those of my colleagues in addition to the hyde amendment restrictions we have accepted these same restrictions on other federal funding funding that has never been used for abortion in the past is unavailable under present budget conditions in the district to be used for abortion now in the face of this uniquely disparate treatment to my district and my constituents a few opponents are now trying to pile on by insisting upon an unprecedented rule that would invade local funding this local funding my friends is 10 percent committed to local necessities other than abortion the conference report on h r 2492 as it now reads is a virtual carbon copy of the bills passed by the house for the 10 years from 1979 to 1989 and in 1991 and 1992 none of these bills for 12 yearsrestricted the districts use of local funds to pay for abortions the language in todays conference report discriminates uniquely against the district of columbia how much invidious treatment should one small jurisdiction be made to bear for 8 fiscal years from 1980 to 1988 the house passed and president reagan signed d c appropriations bills that were silent on the use of local revenues to fund abortions in addition in 4 of the past 5 years the house sent d c appropriations bills to president bush that did not restrict the districts use of local funds to pay for abortions it was not until president bush vetoed those bills that the house included language that restricted the districts use of locally raised funds to pay for abortions thus procedurally what the subcommittee has done in this case is what it has consistently done in the past when conference reports were turned down what our opponents are asking that this body do is unprecedented and a particularly dangerous precedent for conference reports conference reports have almost not been subject to amendment surely this body does not want to create this precederit just to penalize the district unnecessarily when the conference report has already excluded the use of federal funds for abortion i am asking my colleagues not to use the rule as a club to whip the nations capital a vote against this rule does much more than harm the district it is a precedent for the unmitigated confusion that would come with amendments outside conference reports a vote for this rule is in keeping with a long line of precedent that puts this body on record barring abortion using the only funds over which congress has any rightful jurisdiction there are more than 3 billion in funds in this appropriation that were raised exclusively in the district paid for exclusively by district taxpayers and district businesses these funds do not belong in your province my colleagues know well that my district and my constituents are experiencing

to resolve a problem which has resulted from the passage in 1992 of public law 102251 that legislation permitted gambling aboard unitedstatesflag cruise vessels andwas a great boon to our domestic cruise industry unfortunately an unintended consequence of that law has been a disastrous loss of business for the cruise industry in california resulting in a loss of jobs in my district of san diego and indeed throughout the state of california many california cruises embark from one port and then make port at one or two other cities in the state on their way to a final destination in mexico canada or alaska californias legislature became concerned that allowing gaming on these cruises might result in the state being forced to also allow gaming under the indian gaming law consequently the legislature took advantage of their right under the law to prohibit gambling on the intrastate segments of these cruises as a result many california cruise ship companies have bypassed these second and third ports of call within our state for instance ships which once departed los angeles and called at catalina or san diego on their way to mexico would no longer visit these other cities today we stand and watch these cruise ships sailing past this facility my amendment alleviates californias problem and will allow our west coast cruise industry to resume it is a carefully crafted amendment and i believe noncontroversial it has the support of the governors office and the legislature and we have worked with the attorney generals office in crafting it the amendment would extend the coverage of public law 102251 to a voyage that first begins and ends in the same state or unitedstates possession second is part of a voyage to another state or foreign country and third reaches that destination within 3 days of embarkation by establishing federal regulation of these intrastate voyage segments the amendment relieves california at its request of the jurisdiction to permit or prohibit gambling in international waters when a ship ultimately arrives at a foreign or outofstate port within 72 hours this will permit a california cruise vessel to resume multiple ports of call 0

jurisdiction over gambling in international waters it will no way affect any states right to regulate gambling in state waters or on voyages to nowhere or on other intrastate cruises the amendment has been carefully drawn to address a specific problem it has no effect on riverboat gambling or other such issues this language was passed by the house last year as an amendment to h r 1250 the other

why we need health care reform both increased access and cost containment but is also explains why grand academic theories of managed competition wont work uving on a modest income this young couple have a child who needs a serious operation they could join a famous wellestablished hmo and save money and obtain coverage for the needed operation but they would rather save their daughterslife than money and they know that the doctor and the hospital that is most famous for the best treatment of their daughters condition is not in that hmo emily friedman one of the nations best writers and thinkers on health care issues has listed the five rs of why managed competition wont work rural risk race rights and ir rationality as the following letter so clearly demonstrates this young american family wants the right even at great personal expense to themselves to seek t best treatment for their daughter the economists who designed the theory of managed competition would never understand this but when it comes to treating a loved one a family members a baby people are not economic animals they are irrational loving human beings who even on a very limited income will make enormous sacrifices to save their loved one any economic scheme like managed compettion that tries to come between parents and the health of their baby is going to be thwarted by the irrationality of love i wish the professors in their ivory tower would read this letter and as the saying goes get a life representative pets stark 239 cannon office building washington dc dear mr stark i am writing you concerning medical insurance three very serious problems with our current system are gravely affecting my family one is the proexisting condition exclusion clause allowed by insurance companies another is the time limitation on cobra law and the third is the threat of not being able to choose our own doctors i implore you to eliminate proexisting condition exclusion clauses in this countrys new healthcare plan heres why my husband and i have a 3month old daughter who has a congenital heart defect called aortic valve stenosis she looks like the picture of health but in reality she will require an operation probably before shes one year old and because her problem can recur and require another operation the medical insurance companies have declared her undesirable because she has a preexisting condition let me tell you what that means to us as a family since she was born a mere three months ago we have spent 1 224 in insurance premiums we have no other dependents by her first birthday we will have spent 4 = in insurance premiums and those figures do not include our share of the doctor bills which can run up to s6 000 a year in deductibles and copayments for this we are told we should feel lucky after we enroll in my husbands new insurance plan july 1 she will not become eligible for coverage for 12 months her current insurance coverage through a cobra plan im on runs out six months prior to that for those six months from january to july 1994 insurance premiums for the baby alone will cost us more than s3 500 and this doesnt include the cost of any doctors appointments just surgery and hospitalization part of the problem with her insurance has to do with the time limitation on cobra coverage you see ive been covering her on my cobra insurance plan but it runs out six months before she becomes eligible for other insurance the 18month cobra maximum just isnt long enough in some cases like ours and i think exceptions should be made another reason its so expensive to insure her is because we refuse to enroll her in a hmo medical plan which doesnt have a preexisting condition clause i have had bad experiences with that hmo and so have many of my friends are you aware that the hmos doctors are actually provided monetary incentives to steer patients away from further treatment the fewer referrals these doctors make the more money they makel imagine how this would affect treatment for someone like our baby who requires very close followup and only the most skilled specialists we saved our daughter from an unnecessary operation recently because we were able to obtain a second opinion from a doctor of our choice i am not willing to forfeit the right to choose we want to choose our doctors and we are willing to pay something to have that choice but we dont think its fair to be burdened with such high health care costs because our daughter was born with a problem the money we pay for medical insurance is paying for expensive health care and elaborate lifesaving measures for a lot of people who have created their own poor health because they do things like smoke drink take drugs eat unhealthfully and or dont exercise our baby did nothing but be born into this world and i certainly did my part by taking good care of myself during pregnancy my husband and i ar not rich by any means in fact although both of us are collegeeducated professionals from middle class families we now fall into what might be described as the new lower class my husband grosses 26 000 a year as a newspaper editor and i make nothingnot since i was laid off last july when i was eight weeks pregnant a lot of pleasures and even some necessities will have to be sacrificed to give our daughter the medical care she needs and in our downward spiral we can certainly never hope to realize the american dream when we are dead and gone our daughter is going to have to manage her own health insurance its going to be hard enough on her dealing with her health problem much less its expense this excessive monetary outlay is bound to affect the quality of her adult life as it already has ours this kind of medical selectiveness is essentially a form of prejudice thing about it preexisting condition exclusions are similar to other types of discrimination felt by blacks hispanics and other minorities people of color were born

or not you agree with the amendment that the senate passed or whether or not you even agree with the bill itself you should be willing to allow an issue to reach the floor and be debated thats what all of us were sent here to do please vote no on this rule"], [0.4954130947589874, 0.004586905241012573, 0, "what i want to do is recognize if they are going to say no and i really believe the reason they are saying no has less to do with their fiscal problems and more to do with knowing that we are going to come in and bail them out anyway they know this is on the greased skids so they know this is happening so they are not going to put up any money if we are going to pay for the whole thing these folks are not dumb these are elected officials and we like to think we are pretty smart so they know what we are doing here and they know we are going to pass this and they are not going to pass anything that is going to cost them money when we are willing to pay for the whole ball of wax what i am saying is that we need to be responsible here if we are going to take that approach to pay for it that is all i am suggesting let us go back to the committee let us pay for the measure let us come up with the revenue increases or the spending cuts to pay for this and let us move forward i yield 1 minutes to the gentleman from new york"], [0.4958367943763733, 0.004163205623626709, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i find it interesting that this particular amendment was not offered in committee when there was ample time to do it it was not offered it is kind of like the 5 years we have had to do some reform on pilt and we have not done it i say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle this is the chance to get this job done this is a killer amendment if we want to kill pilt vote for this if we want to see it go on and accomplish what we have been working for this is an amendment to be carefully looked at and to kill this amendment so we do not kill the bill i have a hard time with this as i look at it the fiscal concerns that we see coming from some of our friends are the same folks that as the gen tleman from idaho pointed out have authorized 5 billion in new spending in this same area the purpose of s 455 is to update pilt payments for inflationary increases the index provision affects the authorization only and for some reason somehow we are sayall through this debate things other ing in this area in this area only we than authorizations have been brought are going to bind future congresses and up and will prevent this problem from we are going to require them to keep recurring this authorization in law that is irrethis is a compromise and i would sponsible and it is something we should ask that the members defeat this not do amendment and vote for the bill this is a reasonable amendment and i reserve the balance it is one that i hope my colleagues will of my time support"], [0.49598264694213867, 0.9959826469421387, 1, "this bill today is a better bill both for iowa and the united states than we had 9 days ago but let me point out neither bill appropriates money they only authorize money to be appropriated later we have been appropriating money for these same purposes since 1981 without an authorization not one crime has been committed in the last 9 days because the bill did not pass 9 days ago not even one in the whole united states money was appropriated last week for next year for the same purposes as those in this bill we appropriated money a year ago for police prosecutors prisons and crime fighting without this bill what the bill last week did was to raise expectations that social programs would squeeze out some of the crime fighting programs this bill that we have before us today does block grant 13 of those programs that is good that is a good thing in the new bill because it gives local officials more opportunity to use it for the program that will best fit the need in their county however the final decision on appropriations for programs in this bill will be made next year in an appropriation bill at that time will be decided by a majority of this whole house not by a majority of either caucus this bill does change substantive laws on rules of evidence and applies the death penalty to more local crimes even the supreme court justices who fashioned that law in 1972 now say that was a failed experiment but that is in both the bills i think we should pass a bill today and get it over to the senate those who said we should have settled for the original bill were simply wrong and those of us who voted to insist on changes have been proven right waiting 8 days to pass this crime bill instead of the original one represents a big victory for crime fighting in both iowa and the united states"], [0.4960431456565857, 0.9960431456565857, 1, "i move to strike the last word i would only like to say that i support the amendment offered by the gentleman from texas as he presented it on behalf of the committee on agriculture i think that the approach that we are taking here as i understand it is to in effect make certain that the rural development administration continues and the question remains with regard to regional offices and this amendment will in effect allow the regional offices the elimination of regional offices to continue as was provided for under the appropriations bill but it would leave standing the rural development administration as it is and gives the authority to the secretary to transfer funds from the rural development administration and farmers home administration to establish after april 1 1994 any other entity that may be created through the secretarys reorganization plan whatever that may be i would simply like to say that i think that this deals with a concern that has been expressed pertaining to the regional offices and i think that this in fact is a solution that we can all agree with and live with until we have the secretarys reorganization proposal and that has been dealt with so i strongly support the amendment as it stands mr chairman"], [0.4961724579334259, 0.0038275420665740967, 0, "yesterday we offered this amendment and the gentleman from california offered a perfectingamendment we asked to be protected under the rights of the house so we could work out the language and we withdrew the amendments the gentleman from colorado the gentleman from louisiana the gentleman from california and i and the staffs sat back and worked out the language of the perfecting amendment and the reason is this let me go through just briefly what this is about the problem is that when the federal government wants to take land away from private citizens under eminent domain or anything else quite often there is not the money to pay for the land and in the meantime that rancher homeowner or private owner has to live under the restrictions and cannot improve the land therefore the land goes down in value and by the time the federal government pays that individual the land may be worth a nickel on the dollar that is not right and the gentleman from california agrees with that what our amendment did not make clear is that we want in the meantime for the rancher or the private owner to be able to go ahead and utilize the land in a normal way we do not want as the gentleman from california suggested in his perfecting amendment to add toxic waste dumps in that area which would really deflate the value of the land when the federal government took it over and it would cost billions of dollars to take it over or to affect the mining act on parks so we have worked it out and i think the gentleman from colorado the gentleman from louisiana the gentleman from california and myself offer a good amendment and i think we are in agreement with it i do agree that the clean air act would be a fine addition there let me yield to my friend the gentleman from california"], [0.49617820978164673,

gentleman from michigan just made a statement that i think we ought to deal with that is if we lose this the data that is coming down is worthless let me point out again that we have at least eight other centers that collect this data this is not the only one they do not have a unique capacity that no place else has in fact we cannot find any reason through nasa as to why this exists except that a powerful member of the committee on appropriations wanted it in his district that is all we can find if we talk to some of the nasa people privately they will not come in here and say that to us but they will tell us though that that is the case let me point out a second thing and then i will close because we do not want to prolong this too long the second thing is i am not trying to cut out the budget for ciesin what i am doing is asking us to exercise a little fiscal restraint and to cut out the amount of money that nasa did not request let us give nasa every penny they requested but let us cut out the 12 million they did not request"]]}
