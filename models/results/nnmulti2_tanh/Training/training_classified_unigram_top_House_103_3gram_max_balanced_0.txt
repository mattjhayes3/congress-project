the spending would skyrocket from 388 million this year to 541 million in fiscal year 1994 and 1 billion in fiscal year 1995 my amendment would prevent this profligacy and save the taxpayers 800 million it was just a few short weeks ago that the democrats in this house passed a 5year budget plan which included the largest tax increase in american history we were told then by the democrat majority that this hefty contribution on the part of hard working taxpayers was necessary to reduce the federal budget deficit and here they propose increasing spending on corporate giveaway programs by 158 percent and what does h r 820 do under this bill the federal government is going to build an enormous network of technology centers so bureaucrats can show business men and women what machines to buy and how to run their businesses and the same people who gripe about socalled junk bonds are putting uncle sam in the venture capital business if you thought the s l crisis was bad wait until bureaucrats start making multimilliondollar commercial loans and finally the government is going to spend hundreds of millions each year picking winners and losers in the name of promoting technology here is what we are saying to the taxpayers today the government that brought you amtrak the post office the usda and 500 toilet seats at the pentagon is going to teach real entrepreneurs how to beat international competition the reason this bill is on the floor of course is that the majority believes that committees here in congress and the bureaucrats at the commerce department know how to run the economy as george will noted in a column 2 weeks ago the liberals in washington dc believe they know far more about competing in the marketplace than the undiscerning men and women who have risked their life savings to start a real business in the real world well let us take a look at what the democrat majority has already done for business this year it has heaped another mandate on workers and business in the form of mandated leave legislation it has passed a budget resolution which promises business higher energy and corporate income taxes the majority has promised the business community and the country another 5 years of huge budget deficits which will deprive the private sector access to capital but we have only just begun on the way is striker replacement and the rest of the big labor and trial lawyer agenda which will undermine americas competitiveness the finest illustration of the economic illiteracy of the majority is this the democrat party opposes indexing the capital gains taxwhich lowers the cost of capitalyet supports indexing the minimum wagewhich increases the cost of labor but the democrats are here to help business today they say the party that beleaguers business with higher taxes and regulations at every opportunity now wants to help the majority wants to promote economic growth and jobs through investment sounding ironically like supplyside onservativq republicans but as my friend jude wanniski says the majority is operating on the dark side of the supplyside modelinvesting in government bureaucracies instead of the private sector so as russia sweden mexico france poland and on and onmove away from state planning to emulate the american model of free enterprise the majoritywhile paying lipservice to the market seeks to move more and more resources from the productive private sector to the wasteful public sector if my democrat friends are genuinely interested in creating real jobs in the private sector they should consider this over the last 4 years the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent these small businesses create 76 percent of the new jobs in the economy if you want to help the entrepreneur lower his cost of capital stop tying his hands with unnecessary red and green tape do not raise his energy costs and corporate taxes reform americas legal liability laws amend antiquated antitrust law in short get the government off the backs of small business but do not burden all businesses with massive new taxes and regulations and then give away a billion dollars to the politically wellconnected that will not make america more competitive i would close with a quote from adam smith who warned us of politicians who were onceited enough to try to direct an economy he wrote the statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would net only load himaelf a most unnecessary atten tion but same an authority which could safely be trusted to no council and senate whatever and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it

of the freshman class in this body when these members ran for election last year did they tell the voters that they were intending to vote for the largest tax increase in unitedstates history i dont think so did they tell the votersthat they would cast their vote to raise taxes dramatically long before ever voting for any spending cuts i dont think so i dont think my colleagues ran as business as usual tax and spend democrats well then let me explain this budget bill the clinton administration is asking freshmen representatives to support its called the omnibus budget reconciliation act the name is purposely confusing so that the american public is deceived into thinking its something harmless or even good i want the american public to know that this now budget bill really is the largest tax increase in american history it will cost american taxpayers at least 332 billion over the next 5 years as a freshman i have a hard time committing american taxpayers to 332 billion as an engineer i always like to quantify figures using basic math lets see how much this tax hike will really mean to the american family my district is one of 435 districts so i took 332 billion and divided it by 435 the result is 760 million per district that means my district in california alone would be obligated to pay 760 million in new taxes over the next 5 years then i took this simple math a step further there are about 570 000 people in my district so i divided 760 million by 570 000 people i was shocked to see that every man woman and child would have to come up with over 1 300 this means that the average family of 5 will be assessed nearly 7 000 in new tax increases let me repeat 7 000 in new tax increases america has never had this huge a tax increase in its entire history but thats not all this tax bill also includes a new btu tax again lets be honest this is a hidden gas tax this btu tax means 8 cents a gallon that might not should like much but it is were told avg 450 yr of new btu taxes per family is not that big a deal to the average american family i guess this is true its only the price of 2 haircuts but this is not all this btu tax is indexed annually for inflation the cost of this new tax will grow higher and higher each year but wait there is more the btu tax isnt just a gas tax on automobiles it also translates into more taxes on electricity water heating oil and almost every other products so by the time all these new taxes are added together i wouldnt be surprised if the total burden to the average family of 5 will exceed 10 000 in new tax increases thats outrageous we must stop this madness the point i raise for my fellow democratic freshmen is that a yes vote on this tax bill will have grave consequences in 1994 good luck going home and telling people that we voted for the biggest tax increase in unitedstates history i just wanted to quantify this bill using simple mathematics so that the american public will be told the truth let me repeat for the average family of five were looking at nearly 10 000 new taxes i say dont raise taxes no nation has ever taxed its way into prosperity cut these hundreds of wasteful government subsides

people have not had a chance to see it let me tell you how many americans have read the democrat leadership plan that we are supposed to vote on in a few days zero not a single one of the 250 million americans have read the democrat health care plan we should be saying my colleagues let the people see it let the people read it it is unfair for us to try to vote on a plan that our constituents have not had a chance to even look at when it is their right to choose a doctor their right to run a small business their right to invent a new medicine you know we are one of the last nations in the world that does not have socialized medicine theoretically having socialized medicine is a mark of civilization for all the people who have stood up and said we are one of the few nations in the world that doesnt have socialized medicine we ought to have it i look at places like cuba with mr castro who has socialized medicine china has socialized medicine a lot of other third world nations have socialized medicine that is not a sign of civilization it is not a sign of sophistication if you look at the other side of that debate you will see a great nation the united states of america more than half of all of the cures for diseases that are invented annually in the world are invented in the united states isnt that interesting that means we invent more cures more medicines that save lives than all the rest of the nations in the world combined and i would suggest that that is because we do n6t have socialized medicine i would suggest that our freedom has been the driver for innovation our freedom has built a health care system that draws canadians down you know the canadian system was health care nirvana it was heaven on earth and we had a lot of well meaning groups who came in last year and told us how great the canadian health care system was then around christmastime the biggest hospital in ontario shut down for a couple of weeks because they ran out of money funny socialism always runs out of money because governments never spend money in an efficient manner so canadians saw their biggest hospital close down for 2 weeks because they ran out of money then we discovered something else about canadian health care there are 177 000 canadians who are waiting for operations they are waiting in line for operations because you know what socialism causes lines if you do not think so go to the kremlin sometime take a trip to some of those liberated countries in eastern europe socialism causes lines and about 25 percent of the people who were surveyed in canada of those 177 000 waiting in line for an operation 25 percent of them said they are in pain while they wait 01610 we looked at other places we looked at japan that theoretically spends less money on health care it does spend less money but do you know why they spend less money because the average japanese doctor sees 49 patients a day and i had this impression i do not know if my colleagues or you have seen that have read about those professional packers that they have in japan on the subway trains where they get everybody they possible can into the train right at rush hour then they have two professional packers these packers are like sumo wrestler they are big healthy people they do not hurt anybody but their job is to pack the last possible person that they can get into that train they want to get that guy picked right inside there so they can close the doors and go out with a full train that is the impression i had when i read that their doctors see 49 people a day they do mass examinations americans do not want to walk in with 15 or 20 people and do an examination en masse that is japan they are heavy on efficiency they are a little bit short on privacy let us look at great britain which has socialized medicine that socialism that winston churchill described as shared misery they have a system in which senior citizens elderly people are not given lifesaving operations that is because socialism never works very effectively and they ran out of money so they tell senior citizens who are over a certain age you cannot have this lifesaving operation because you have lived a long and full life and you have to fall off the tree like a leaf in the autumn and let a younger person have that lifesaving operation that is great unless you happen to have fathers and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers who mean something to you and you know american families have a lot of grandmothers and grandfathers who mean something to them and so we do not want to have that brand of socialized medicine to date this administration has not shown us one model country that has a medical system a socialized medical system that we should follow last let me talk about something that is kind of near and dear to americans hearts that is a job remember that gentleman herb kane who stood with the president on a nationally televised program and he said he is a guy who owns godfathers pizza his father worked three jobs a day so he could go to college and become a success and herb kane said mr president i have put a pencil to your numbers here to your plan i will have to fire a lot of people i am paraphrasing him he said this is not going to work out i am going to have to close down franchises and get rid of folks the president said to him i do not know why you just cannot raise the cost of your pizza i could see a look of shock on mr kanes face and when he addressed the republicans recently he said to the effect if i could get more money for my pizzas i would be doing it you cannot just raise the price of your product and expect to continue in business he said i am asked by people why i do not feel i have a duty to give every single person who works for me a health care plan he says that is because my first duty is to give them a job and we are going to lose a lot of jobs under socialized medicine the plan that the gentleman from missouri is putting together with other democrat leaders right now is socialized medicine it is socialized medicine that is going to require employer mandates that means employers are going to have to pay a big new tax we have a group that is a think tank and there is plenty of think tanks around the country but the consad study group did an evaluation on how many american jobs will be lost under the ways and means committee plan that is the democratcontrolled committee that developed the plan in this house that is being followed by the gentleman from missouri by the democrat leadership is putting together their socialized medicine plan let me tell you how many jobs they say will be lost and how many will be affected what is an affected job it is a job not lost it is a job where you never get any raise you do not get any raise because your employer is spending the money he would have used to give you a raise buying this health care plan that he is forced to buy by government so
