our balanced budget takes onequarter out of every dollar for tax relief in fact over the next 5 years we pay down 861 billion of the national debt while providing 156 billion in tax relief one of the biggest concerns i often hear in the district that i represent in chicago in the south suburbs is the issue of fairness particularly tax fairness people are frustrated that taxes are so high but they are also frustrated how complicated they are and how unfair they are i have often asked this question is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay more in taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes i happen to have with me today a photo of a couple from joliet illinois two public school teachers michelle and shad hallihan who by the way just had a baby boy named benjamin just the other day they are celebrating the birth of that child they are a typical couple that pays the marriage tax penalty my friends on the other side they call michelle and shad a special interest because we are trying to help them but these are folks who suffer the average marriage tax penalty and 1 400 is a lot of money in joliet illinois it is 1 years tuition at a local community college several months worth of day care it is real money for people like michelle and shad hallihan now president clinton says he would much rather spend their money here in washington because he could do it better than they can that is really what this issue is all about do we spend michelle and shads money or do we eliminate that marriage tax penalty of course the president vetoed that effort to eliminate their marriage tax penalty today if my colleagues think about it their little boy benjamin just born just in the last few weeks if they were able to take advantage of the education savings account tax relief that was included in this which would allow them to set up to 2 000 a year in a special account for benjamins education h8620 co michelle and shad if we were to eliminate their marriage tax penalty could put that marriage tax penalty into that account and in 18

support of our efforts to eliminate the marriage tax penalty many of us over the last several years have asked a very basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code a married working couple where both a husband and wife are in the workforce that they pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right that 25 million married working couples 50 million taxpayers pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married we call that 1 400 the marriage tax penalty it affects married couples who because they have two incomes they are forced to file jointly they are pushed into a higher tax bracket and they pay higher taxes it is a marriage tax penalty and it is wrong let me introduce to the house some constituents of mine michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers from a community of manhattan just south of joliet illinois shad is a teacher at joliet high school michelle at manhattan junior high their combined income is about 62 000 they are middleclass teachers they are homeowners of course since they were married they have since had a child little ben remember their family someone new in their lives and they are so proud of little ben here who is growing very quickly their marriage tax penalty is about 1 000 a year that they pay just because they are married i think it is a fair question is it right is it fair that shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers who work very hard every day have a new little boy in their lives have to pay higher taxes send money to washington just because they are married i am proud to say this conference report before it eliminates the marriage tax penalty that good people hardworking middleclass people like shad and michelle hallihan pay every year because they are married under our conference report we help those who itemize their taxes as well as those who do not now my friends on the other side of the aisle say that if one is middle class and one itemizes ones taxes usually because one is a homeowner or one gives money to ones institutions of faith or church or synagogue or charity one is rich and one does not deserve marriage tax relief well republicans and fortunately 48 democrats believe we should help the middleclass homeowners who give money to charity they are not rich they work hard shad and michelle hallihan make 62 000 a year they itemize their taxes now we help those who do not itemize their taxes in this conference by doubling the standard deduction that is used by those who do not itemize their taxes we double that for joint filers to twice that as singles for those who are itemizers like michelle and shad hallihan and little ben who are homeowners so they are forced to itemize we widen the 15 percent bracket that is the basic tax bracket that affects everybody we widen that so joint filers married couples like shad and michelle with two incomes can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in the same tax bracket the same 15 percent tax bracket what i think is most exciting about this bill not only do we help middleclass families who are homeowners and give money to church and charity who itemize those taxes as well as those who do not is that it is effective this year when we pass this legislation and put it on the presidents desk today the president will have an opportunity if he signs it into law to help married couples 25 million married working couples this year because i would point out that doubling the standard deduction which helps those who do not itemize and widening the 15 percent tax bracket which helps those who do itemize such as homeowners and those that give money to church and charity that they will receive marriage tax relief this year because this legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 think about that when my friends on the other side of the aisle and bill clinton and al gore raised taxes in 1993 they made their tax increase retroactive which meant they went back in the tax year and took ones money well this year we have an opportunity to give marriage tax relief this year which means we go back to january 1 of this year if one is married one of 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty one is going to see marriage tax relief this year in tax year 2000 that is a great opportunity if one believes in fairness in the tax code as we do it is time to make the tax code more fair and more simple we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty now my friends on the other side of the aisle have been making lots of excuses they really do not want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty because they would much rather spend shad and michelles money they believe it is better spent here in washington than shad and michelle hallihan can spend it back in joliet illinois think about it the average marriage tax penalty for good hardworking middleclass married couples like shad and michelle hallihan 1 400 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet community college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home it is

on families my friends on the other side of the aisle always say it is going to somehow hurt people when they lower their taxes now where i come from people tell me their tax burden is too high our tax burden today is 21 percent of our economy which is consumed by the federal government since 1993 the tax burden has continued to go up in fact in 1993 the tax burden was less than 18 percent today it is 21 percent of our gross domestic product going to the federal government that tax burden is too high when it comes to medicare and social security thanks to this republican congress we have a balanced budget the first balanced budget in 28 years it is now projected to provide a 3 trillion surplus over the next 10 years under our budget of course we do something that congresses of the past and presidents of the past for the last 30 years have refused to do and that is we set aside 100 percent of social security for retirement security to save medicare and social security now these 3 dollar bills i have each dollar bill represents 1 trillion under our budget we set aside 1 trillion 2 trillion in fact we set aside twothirds of the socalled surplus over the next 10 years for retirement security leaving onethird for other purposes we believe the vast majority of that extra surplus the nonsocial security surplus should go to help working families helping working families by lowering their taxes now folks complain their taxes are too high that is a common copcern but folks also tell me back home that the tax code is too complicated they are frustrated that they will have to hire someone else to do their taxes they are frustrated about the unfairness of the tax code frankly a lot of them are just plain angry that under our tax code a married working couple on average pays 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married under this packaged tax relief to help working families we eliminate the marriage tax penalty for a majority of those who suffer it i have an example here of a couple back in joliet illinois michelle and shad callahan they are schoolteachers in the joliet public school district in fact michelle here is due any day to have a baby their first child they discovered when they got married that they now pay higher taxes just because they are married in fact they pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 their combined income is about 60 000 under our legislation we passed out of the house 70 percent of taxpayers receive direct marriage tax relief i believe by the time the house and senate work out their differences more families like michelle and shad will receive marriage tax relief we work to address the marriage tax penalty addressing the unfairness in the tax code and also simplify the tax code because in the housepassed tax relief 6 million couples will no longer need to itemize i would also point out that under our legislation since michelle is due to have a baby like many moms like to do she is a working mom she may take some time off from being in the work force to be home with her baby under the legislation we passed out of the house we are going to let michelle make up missed contributions to her retirement accounts with catchup provisions that will help michelle and shad and working families just like michelle and shad callahan this legislation is good legislation we simplify the code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty for millions of working couples by eliminating the death tax which is suffered by family farmers and family businesses by providing alternative minimum tax relief to millions of middle class families that now suffer the alternative minimum tax also if one is selfemployed an entrepreneur we give 100 percent deductibility for ones health insurance the same corporations get today one only gets 60 percent and we believe one should get 100 percent lowering taxes in a time of prosperity is a good idea in fact let me quote a democrat on the other side of the aisle bob kerrey

work period conducting 15 town meetings and i wanted to report today on really the response to the republican agenda of good schools and low taxes and a secure retirement for all americans i have the privilege of representing a very very diverse district the south side of chicago in the south suburbs of cook and will counties as well as a lot of rural and bedroom communities and one always listens for the common concerns when they represent a diverse district of cities suburbs and country during the last two weeks i got a pretty good response people were very supportive of the republican agenda of strengthening our local schools of lowering the tax burden for the middle class of making for a secure retirement for all americans by strengthening medicare and social security i would like to take a few minutes just to talk about some of those specifics of our republican agenda and of course let me begin with the republican efforts to strengthen social security and to strengthen medicare for the next three generations i am often asked a common question over the last several years that i have had the privilege of being in the congress and that question is when are you politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund i was pleased to tell my constituents that this is the year we are going to do that this is the year we are going to wall off the social security trust fund and say hands off and my constituents frankly were pretty shocked when they learned that the clintongore budget actually raids the social security trust fund by 351 billion i think it is important to note that when we compare republican efforts to wall off the social security trust fund which means 100 percent of social security according to this chart for social security versus the clintongore proposal for 62 percent of the social security trust fund going to social security and the other 38 percent being spent on other things that is what this means the president wants to spend 38 percent of social security on new government programs republicans of course want to wall off the social security trust fund essentially putting trust back in the trust fund with 100 percent of social security for social security and that is a big victory i also want to note that the republican budget sets aside almost 400 billion more than the clintongore budget for medicare and social security now our second priority in our agenda of course is lower taxes for the middle class and i am one who believes that when the tax burden for the average family in illinois is about 40 percent of their income going to local state and federal government for taxes that that tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden particularly for the middle class and when we talk about the tax burden i find that constituents whether it is at the union hall or the vfw or the local chamber of commerce they tell me that the tax code is too complicated requires too much paperwork and the majority of people have to hire someone else to fill out the tax forms and i also point out that the tax burden is really unfair as we work this year to lower the tax burden i believe that our top priority should be to simplify the tax code to address the unfairness in the tax code and of course we need to begin by eliminating the marriage tax penalty is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple living together outside a marriage that is wrong that our tax code punishes marriage the marriage tax elimination act has 230 cosponsors let us get it done this year let us simplify the tax code and eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the republican agenda a secure retirement and lower taxes also includes strengthening our local schools and we want to strengthen our local schools by empowering our local school boards and our local teachers and our local parents to run their schools and giving them the flexibility of course to meet the needs of local communities and that is an important shift because previously for 30 to 40 years all the power was moving to washington and i talk with local school administrators and school board members they tell me maybe in illinois 6 percent of our public schools budget comes from washington but so does twothirds of the paperwork and almost 100 percent of the mandates micromanaging how our schools are run we want to let local schools run themselves and meet the needs of their local communities and that is why we want to pass the ed flex legislation my hope it will be on the presidents desk fairly soon the other concern that local school board members also share with me is they say as my colleagues know youve increased funding at the federal level by 10 percent even while youve been balancing the budget increasing funding for education but if you look at how those dollars have been spent only 70 cents of every dollar actually reaches the classroom thirty cents is lost in the washington bureaucracy our goal is to ensure that more dollars get to the classroom with a goal of 95 cents on the dollar reaching the classroom and if we compare that to the current cost of delivering those funds to our looal schools that is a 25 percent funding increase above and beyond what they are currently receiving we are providing 22 billion in federal funding for our local schools it is just wrong that 30 cents on the dollar currently is lost in washington let us help our local schools let us lower the tax burden for the middle class let us secure retirement by strengthening medicare and social security"], [0.001374661922454834, 0.001374661922454834, 0, "i move to suspend the rules

elected in congress in 1994 what were the big issues of the day the democrat congress and president clinton had just enacted the biggest tax hike in the history of this country raising our tax burden to its highest level ever in peacetime history we had massive deficits of 200 billion to 300 billion a year as far as the eye could see and there was a proposed government takeover of our health care system the american people did not necessarily like that situation and they gave the republicans the opportunity to be in the majority for the first time in 40 years we said that we were going to meet the challenges we were going to balance the budget we were going to cut taxes for the middle class that we were going to reform welfare and of course pay downthe national debt i am proud to say that over the last 5 years we have accomplished many of those goals in fact every one of them we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years we cut taxes for the middle class for the first time in 16 years in fact 3 million illinois children benefit from that 500 per child tax credit the first welfare reform in a generation has reduced our nations welfare rolls by onehalf and we overhauled the irs and paid down 350 billion of the national debt those are great changes on top of that this past year we stopped the terrible practice probably washingtons dirtiest little secret and that is republicans put a stop to the raid on social security this past year for the first time in 30 years we balanced the budget without touching one dime of social security protecting that retirement income for our seniors those are great accomplishments of course this year we are working to continue our effort to save social security and medicare to pay down the national debt to help our local schools we also want to bring about tax fairness i thought i would take the next hour to discuss the issue of tax fairness one of the most fundamental questions of fairness that i am often asked in the south side of chicago the south suburbs the rural areas that i represent is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples on average pay almost 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married does that seem right that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay 1 400 more just because they are married than an identical couple with an identical income identical circumstances who live together outside of marriage that is not right is it this house over the last few years has been working to eliminate what we call the marriage tax penalty we sent to the president last year legislation which would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty had it been in effect and not vetoed by the president it would have provided marriage tax relief for 25 million couples this year we are back at it again in fact tomorrow this house is going to vote on a standalone bill a clean marriage tax elimination proposal h r 6 which i am proud to say has the bipartisan cosponsorship of 241 members of the house the state of illinois that i represent has 1 1 million couples suffering the marriage tax penalty i have a photo with me of really a fine example of a young couple in joliet illinois two married schoolteachers who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they teach in the joliet schools they suffer the marriage tax penalty in fact michelle pointed out to me we just had a baby of course they benefit from the 500 per child tax credit that we enacted just a few short years ago but they suffer a marriage tax penalty michelle shared she said tell your friends in the congress that if you wipe out the marriage tax penalty for the hallihan family that the money that otherwise would have gone to washington in extra taxes because we are married would buy 3 000 diapers to help us care for our child in the south suburbs of chicago 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at joliet community college and other colleges in illinois it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center it is real money for real people we are going to be voting on legislation tomorrow which of course wipes out the marriage tax penalty for a majority of those who suffer it it is legislation that helps 25 million couples it does several things first we double the standard deduction for joint filers the marriage tax penalty results from filing taxes jointly michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers with incomes that are nearly identical are similar to this machinist and schoolteacher what causes the marriage tax penalty is a married couple files jointly when you file jointly you combine your income if you stay single you do not so when you combine your income that pushes you into a higher tax bracket there is a case here of a machinist at caterpillar say he is single making 30 500 basically the identical income to shad and michelle if he stays single he stays in the 25 percent tax bracket if he meets a schoolteacher in joliet with an identical income of 30 500 their combined income of 61 000 because they choose to get married file jointly pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket as we can see from this example they pay basically the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 just because they are married it is just wrong that under our

that i encourage my colleagues to take a look at and support one is the minimum payment that we have that we have better disclosures on how long it would simply take to repay a balance if they pay the minimum almount each month that is the minimum payments requirement secondly the socalled teaser rates is that companies need to disclose what that introductory rate is if it is 9 or 10 percent and then what it is going to go up to after it teases them with that first 9 or 10 percent if it is then going to be 11 or 12 or 18 or 19 percent later on we need consumer disclosure and consumer protections so this is a good amendment offered by the gentleman from virginia and the gentleman from california and the gentleman from new york i strongly encourage my colleagues to support it and hopefully that will continue to improve this bill and we will have a sound bill both on personal responsibility and the consumer protections aspects"], [8.317828178405762e-05, 0.49991682171821594, 0,

briefed and they disgust me today what is the difference between a bond movie and the select committees report in the bond movie the department of justice would have allowed wiretaps in a bond movie

supports the idea that the cost of that bill should be paid for without raiding social security money now common sense would tell us we would therefore have on the floor the norwooddingell bill with offsetting provisions to make sure it is paid for without touching social security that is what common sense would tell us but that is not what we are permitted to do here today and that is what is wrong with this rule this rule is a conscious attempt to subvert the will of the majority it is the tyranny of the minority in urging my colleagues to oppose this rule i am not certain that we are

making and updating transplant policies with a statutory requirement that all organs be allocated where appropriate in other words the sickestfirst approach that the secretary originally advocated the amendment also would require by law the transplant policy to allocate all organs over the largest geographic area aformulation that would throw out the current local regional national approach this requirement together with other language in the amendment obviously has its goal as a single national list approach finally the amendment would require by law that where transplant policies based on medical urgency are not appropriate such as in kidney transplants all organs be allocated among individuals based on their time on the waiting list coupled with the requirement that waiting time

the onset it should be noted that the work of the conferees is not being done at this moment because we have to be here to be dealing with what in all due respect to the gentleman i consider a waste of time the fact of life is that there is a process a process where the house passes a bill and the senate passes a bill and under our system we sit down to work it out the gentleman does what he considers a good job at singling out some items that if we look at any budget could be for some people questionable items but this is the commerce justice state federal judiciary census bureau ins fcc ftc noaa this is a bill that encompasses so much that to single out some items that he may think are not proper and then try to in fact instruct the conferees to go out and destroy the bill is totally improper it is for that reason that i rise in strong opposition to the motion to instruct conferees on the commerce justice state judiciary appropriations bill this is as i said a waste of time conferees are unable to meet because we have to be on the floor on the motion i would be interested in knowing what programs of say the justice department the gentleman from oklahoma considers nonessential for that matter how would the gentleman from oklahoma define nonessential i expect his definition would not agree with mine or with that of the administration does nonessential mean unauthorized much of the justice department is unauthorized does nonessential mean mostly salaries and expenses of federal employees the fbi is mostly salaries and expenses the second item in the motion suggests that the gentleman from oklahoma thinks unitedstates engagement with the world is of little importance i wonder that after the senates failure to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty last week the gentleman also wishes to put the house on record as also favoring withdrawal from world leadership and refusal to meet our membership obligations to the various international organizations on the third point it has been clear from the beginning that the allocations within which the house and senate wrote their bills were too low and therefore unacceptable to many democrats and certainly to the president if republicans are truly interested in getting the appropriations bills passed they will have to compromise with the senate and the white house that is a fact doing as the gentleman suggests moves us in the opposite direction i would remind the gentleman that while he has strong views on spending restraint which i respect and while this motion may actually pass because it is not binding so it is basically free the votes are not there to pass bills that look the way he wants them to look i urge my colleagues not to support this motion and to have a fuller understanding of what this whole process is about i would urge the gentleman to take a closer look at the various departments and agencies and the significance of this whole bill rather than to single out something which he feels is not proper and therefore should destroy a whole bill and a whole process i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.000526130199432373, 0.5005261301994324, 1, "i yield
