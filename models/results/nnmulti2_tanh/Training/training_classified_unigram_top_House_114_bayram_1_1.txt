up for gun safety right now hundreds of people are outside some standing on the steps 91 of them wearing orange tshirts representing the average of 91 americans killed by guns every day in the united states of america i am from chicago and just last night nbc news ran a story on gun violence in chicago titled city under siege over the fourth of july weekend 50 people were shot in chicago three of the victims were children including two young cousins 8 and 5 years old who were shot while celebrating with their family on one street someone put a handmade sign that read dont shoot kids at play the stories of children caught in the middle of the ongoing gun violence epidemic are seemingly endless just last week dantignay brashear was walking down the street in chicago with her 4yearold son kavan when he was shot in the face speaking about the shooting the next day dantignay said he was with me he was holding my hand she thought he was safe we cannot accept the status quo when children are unsafe walking down the street holding their mothers hand kavan survived but his mother said how am i going to explain to him when he looks in the mirror and sees his face i wonder how do we explain to kavan and his mother that this house refused to take action to prevent this from happening to him or to any other child 1115 inaction in the face of these daily tragedies is simply not acceptable anymore chicago and illinois are trying to respond to this crisis but we need federal action chicago has increased its police presence law enforcement takes an illegal gun off the streets of chicago every 75 minutes illinois has enacted reasonable gun violence prevention measures there is no way for chicago or illinois to keep up with the influx of guns that are coming from across state lines sixty percent of the firearms used in chicago gun crimes come from out of state most come from just one state indiana the bloodshed in chicago doesnt start with the pull of a trigger it starts when the gun is purchased without necessary precautions in indiana no license or permit is required to purchase a gun there is no registration of weapons there is no waiting period to purchase a gun there are no restrictions on assault weapons any individual can take advantage of the lack of gun violence prevention laws in indiana and they do individuals purchase firearms at gun shows with no background checks at all and drive them back to chicago across the state line where they wind up on our city streets no state can address the gun violence epidemic alone we need federal action to require background checks on all gun purchases universal comprehensive background checks will keep guns out of the hands of criminals domestic abusers and the severely mentally ill universal background checks will not stop every gun death nono single piece of legislation not all the legislation in the worldbut they will certainly help they will save lives we simply cant stay silent any longer each day eight people are shot in chicago the american people are demanding action and it is time that the house listened to them speaker ryan call the bills maybe they will pass and maybe they

proximately caused by the party making the payment the jackson lee amendment would provide an exemption for cases where funds are necessary to remedy generalized harm other than for restitution to specific or immediately identifiable victims in particular jackson lee amendment no 4 would allow the federal government to engage with third parties that help carry out settlement agreementsagain settlement agreementsdollars that are under the purview of the settlement and that are minute in distribution indicated 1 1 percent in furtherance of resolution of the civil action or potential civil action in specific relation to sexual harassment violence or discrimination in the workplace jackson lee amendment no 4 would carve out this additional exception to protect such actions and the ability to provide the mediators or other third parties to intervene on behalf of civil action litigants it is clear that we have had a number of civil rights violations in this country we are not yet through with overcoming discrimination in many aspects of life particularly in workplace discrimination for instance in the settlement of an eeoc sexual harassment case of female laundry workers a consent decree resolving the case provides that in addition to paying 582 000 suffolk laundry will adopt new procedures to prevent sexual harassment and will train its managers and staff on identifying and preventing sexual harassment and retaliation the policies and staff training will be available in spanish eeoc will monitor suffolk laundrys compliance with these obligations and title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 for a period of 4 years because of this consent decree these women will receive due compensation for the abuse they suffered and there is confidence with the consent decree in place and the conditions of that consent decree that no more employees will be victimized in the future in another example of an eeoc sex discrimination lawsuitand so there will be those that will help implement this settlementthe cintas corporation settled to pay 1 5 million the corporation entered into a further agreement to hire an outside expert to reevaluate the criteria used to screen interview and select employees and the interview guides used in employee hiring to provide training to the individuals involved in the selection of employees whereby such training would cover record retention and an explanation of what constitutes an unlawful employment practice under title vii to continue to provide diversity harassment and antidiscrimination training annually to employees to post a notice informing employees that federal law prohibits discrimination and to report to eeoc over an approximate 28month period information and materials on training programs recruiting logs descriptions and explanations for any changes i would argue the point that this helps to promote the antidiscrimination necessary to correct the pathway that some have found their way in the jackson lee amendment no 4 would create an appropriate exemption to the absolute block and prohibition that the underlying legislation provides mr chair the jackson lee amendment no 4 exempts from h r 5063 settlement agreements that resolves a civil action or potential civil action in relation to sexual harassment violence or discrimination in the workplace mr chair h r 5063 as currently drafted is flawed and misguided this bill seeks to exempt only those payments to parties other than the government to provide restitution for actual harm directly and proximately caused by the party making the payment a few months ago we saw that the justice department filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the state of north carolina and other parties declaring north carolina house bill 2s restroom restriction unlawfully discriminatory attorney general loretta lynch stated that this complaint was about a great deal more than just bathrooms she explained this is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we as a people and as a country have enacted to protect themindeed to protect all of us and its about the founding ideals that have led this countryhaltingly but inexorablyin the direction of fairness inclusion and equality for all americans enforcing these rights is as important today as they were during the enactment of the civil rights act over fifty years ago h r 5063 would prohibit remediation of generalized harm in civil rights cases restricting relief for nonparties to the litigation and nonidentifiable victims of discrimination professor david uhlmann observed during last months hearing on this bill fails to adequately address the fact that generalized harm arises in civil cases including cases involving harm to our communities that cannot be addressed by restitution in these cases professor uhlmann concluded thirdparty payments are appropriate yet the majority witness daniel lungren specifically testified on behalf of the chamber that the bill should prohibit the unitedstates government from entering into a settlement agreement requiring a defendant to donate to an organization or individual not a party to the litigation the jackson lee amendment no 4 would remedy this flaw by creating an exception to cases where settlement funds are directed to the remediation of generalized harm other than restitution to identifiable victims for instance in the settlement of an eeoc sexual harassment case of female laundry workers and a consent decree resolving the case provides that in addition to paying 582 000 suffolk laundry will adopt new procedures to prevent sexual harassment and will train its managers and staff on identifying and preventing sexual harassment and retaliation the policies and staff training will be available in spanish eeoc will monitor suffolk laundrys compliance with these obligations and title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 for a period of four years because of this consent decree these women will receive due compensation for the abuse they suffered and there is confidence with the consent decree in place and the conditions of that consent decree that no more employees will be victimized in the future in another example of an eeoc sex discrimination lawsuit where cintas corporation settled to pay 1 5 million the corporation entered into a further agreement to hire an outside expert to revalidate the criteria used to i screen interview and select employees and the interview guides used in employee hiring to provide training to the individuals involved in the selection of employees whereby such training would cover record retention and an explanation of what constitutes an unlawful employment practice under title vii to continue to provide diversity harassment and antidiscrimination training annually to employees to post a notice informing employees that federal law prohibits discrimination and to report to eeoc over an approximate

unprivileged materials and reports from any audits made of a facilitys employee hiring or recruitment methods or practices should an audit be done record retention and reporting on applicant data according to eeoc general counsel david lopez the injunctive relief obtained provides confidence and a strong foundation for eliminating barriers in recruiting and hiring women and will prevent the reoccurrence of this type of situation the jackson lee amendment no 4 would have a direct impact on these very types of cases by providing an exception to cases where funds are directed to the remediation of generalized harm as highlighted in the above agreements that falls within the category of other than direct restitution to the identifiable victims accordingly i urge adoption of the

issue that often goes overlooked in our communities and that is the terrible problem of hunger among aging adults food insecurity among seniors has doubled since 2001 and is expected to increase significantly as the baby boomer generation ages today food insecurity impacts 5 million seniors across the country forcing them to make impossible decisions between food medical care home heating and other necessities we know that hunger is a health issue and that is especially true among seniors over the age of 60 research from feeding america suggests that compared to their foodsecure neighbors seniors suffering from hunger are 60 percent more likely to experience depression 53 percent more likely to report a heart attack 52 percent more likely to develop asthma and 40 percent more likely to report an experience of congestive heart failure baby boomers spend twice as much on health care as young adults do ensuring seniors have access to nutritious food is vitally important we know that seniors have unique nutritional needs and i am pleased to see scientists collaborating to create nutritional guidance for seniors researchers at the jean mayer usda human nutrition research center on aging at tufts university with support from the aarp foundation recently unveiled an updated myplate for older adults graphic to help seniors visualize what foods cover the nutritional needs that make up a healthy plate for adults their age the new icon also encourages them to follow healthy eating patterns i was pleased to join scientists from tufts as well as representatives of aarp last week at a briefing on capitol hill to unveil the new myplate icon and educate congressional staff on the importance of senior nutrition but if we want to ensure seniors have access to nutritious foods we must also ensure that they have the ability to afford fruits vegetables and other healthy options one critical step we can take toward the goal of ending senior hunger is closing what is referred to as the senior snap gap while millions of our parents grandparents teachers and friends are facing hunger only a fraction of lowincome seniors eligible for food assistance through snap are accessing the benefits presumably because of the stigma associated with assistance or because seniors are unaware they qualify for benefits many seniors also suffer from limited mobility or may have issues completing benefit applications which can be complex and very timeconsuming in fact seniors are more likely than any other age group to be eligible for snap but they are not enrolled to receive the benefits that is why i am pleased to see so many advocacy organizations using older americans month to call attention to the issue of senior hunger through their hashtag solve senior hunger campaign feeding america and other antihunger and aging organizations across the country are reaching out to seniors and their loved ones to raise awareness and ensure that those seniors who are eligible to receive snap benefits are connected to the appropriate resources we should do all we can to help solve senior hunger by talking to our family members and friends about senior hunger and by partnering with leaders in our communities who work to improve access to nutritious food for senior populations during my years in congress i have had the opportunity to visit food banks and other organizations in my district that are working to end hunger among seniors last year i had the privilege of spending a day with a meals on wheels program that is based in northampton massachusetts which is part of my congressional district i helped to prepare and deliver meals and had the opportunity to speak with seniors who were served through this incredible program members of congress have an important role in ensuring our nations seniors dont go hungry i encourage all of my colleagues to spend time with similar programs in their districts congress must adequately fund programs like meals on wheels which provides nutritious food to seniors and reject harmful cuts to snap which will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us children seniors and the disabled that hunger is still a big problem

good friend congressman green my nextdoor neighbor in houston and a friend of many of the same friends we know the work of the naacp local chapter in houston texas now the leading president is as i call him dean james douglas many presidents before of course have ably served our local chapter but we come today to acknowledge the grandness of the naacp and as my colleague congressman rangel just mentioned it is an organization that is everywhere in all ways it is well to note that many of the successes that we have had in freedom justice and liberty have come about through the naacp president truman was the first president in 1948 to speak to the naacp but it was not just an oration if you will the naacp seeks to work collaborate and get things done it was that close relationship with president truman that generated a commission that in the late 1940s after world war ii where soldiers came home to a secondclass citizenship soldiers who left the hills and valleys of america the farms and the urban centers of america african americans colored boys who went into world war ii came out as a secondclass citizen you will hear stories of soldiers coming back home being forced off trains or in the back of the train or the back of the bus not being offered food at a train station even with the uniform on so heroes that had fought in the war and managed to survive and come home still came to a segregated america it was in that backdrop that president truman spoke to the naacp and they called for a commission to address the question of civil rights in america out of that came thebecause it was in the realm of world war ii out of that came an important announcement that really i think was the predecessor to desegregating america that of course was the executive order that desegregated the united states military that is the clout of the naacp through the yearsthrough the yearsthe naacp certainly has a long history starting in its early birth but i want to carry it forward into the 1950s and into the utilization of thurgood marshall now it is called the naacp legal defense fund that separated it out but it was these lawyers of the naacp that rose to defend those in the civil rights movement who were the foot soldiers and the actors of the civil rights movement meaning acting on the issue the activists and they had the cerebral opportunity if you will the cerebral leaders the lawyers that came together to provide them the legal armor that they needed certainly we know that thurgood marshall had a very fond expression and appreciation for the naacp so we come through these years in the 1950s and the 1960s and the kind of continued support that the naacp provided in lasting and embracinglasting and embracingso it embraced the southern christian leadership conference which i had the privilege of working for it embraced various other organizations it embraced the various faiths in our community and it embraced any organization that was moving toward justice as dr king said bending that arc toward justice the naacp was there with its many chapters and it was there with providing the education of so many of these individuals that were in fact i call them foot soldiers in every hamlet of america now we come if i may cite him in the civil rights movement again joining with those marching across the edmund pettus bridge being a mighty vehicle if i might a lobbyist i understand congressman clarence mitchell was called the 101st senator he was a lobbyist for the naacp he was on the cutting edge of every single civil rights legislation for a period of i believe 40 years i may be exaggerating the timeframe but he was there for the 64 civil rights act there for the 65 voting rights act clarence mitchell of the naacp was an advocate not a lobbyist on behalf of the naacp and met and stood if you will to debate not on the floor of the senate with the strom thurmonds and others who had a different opinion about desegregation of this country let me take note of the fact that today i had the privilege of seeing an unveiling of a stamp in honor of robert robinson taylor the greatgrandfather of valerie jarrett and what i would say is that even his success in the backdrop of being the first graduate of mit african american graduate you can be assured that the naacp was moving along to add to the civil rights aspect of the great outstanding success and leadership that this gentleman mr taylor has shown so the naacp has been there to make a pathway the naacp has been there to embrace the naacp has been there to collaborate the naacp has been there to stand with you when you need them to stand with you i close by indicating that we have had a challenging year of addressing issues of criminal justice reform and i am very grateful that the naacp has also taken up this issue and will be a partner on this issue of criminal justice reform working with many of us as we commit to americanot just african americansthat we will answer the question dealing with justice equality and liberty i pay tribute finally mr green to the leader of actso who lost her life in the local chapter of the naacp i want to

well stimulation offshore fracking has been occurring for over 20 years off californias coast and yet we know very little about the impacts on our oceans that is why last year i introduced h r 1951

earlier this year this assessment confirmed that the potential for negative impacts on the environment and wildlife from offshore fracking and acid well stimulation as well as the many unknowns as to

but here is an opportunity for us to come together i am concerned about the debt my colleagues are concerned about the debt but here is an opportunity for us to show the american people that sent us here that we care about them we are listening to the american people and we are willing to do something about it in order to make sure that this policy results in that food going to our fellow citizens who need it most"], [0.48288434743881226, 0.017115652561187744, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i want to begin by saying i also have a great deal of respect for the distinguished minority leader she used in her remarks and made the point that the president had asked for a number of things last year the president asked for a billion dollars more for the nih we said you know we didnt think you asked for enough so we are going to give you 2 billion somehow that seems to get lost last year the president sent down his request for the centers for disease control we said you know we dont think you are spending enough on public health mr president we are going to spend more money than you asked for this year when the president submitted his budget he decided i am going to take a billion dollars of discretionary spending away from the national institutes of health and spend it someplace else we said no mr president we think that is pretty reckless by the way my democratic friends agreed with that too we said we are not going to let you take a billion dollars of discretionary money away from the nih and spend it someplace else we are going to keep it right there and by the way we are going to put more money than you asked for in this agency when the bill comes out and we are probably going to do the same thing for the centers for disease control so to suggest that the president hasnt gotten what he has asked for is to frankly misstate the facts we have had a great deal of mention that the president has had the request for 94 days what we have not had is one shred of evidence that in those 94 days he has not had the money to do every single thing he wanted to do indeed the chairman of the committee urged him to start spending money immediately to do that so there has been no loss of effort and the bill in front of us now funds it for the rest of the fiscal year it also funds the research on the vaccine at the nih into next year so again i am just going to simply disagree with my friend that money has not been available it has been available and frankly to the appropriate agencies more money has been available than the president has asked for more money will be available next year than he asked for i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from texas the distinguished chairman of the rules committee and my good friend"],

family with the clay hunt sav act clays story was one of bravery and dedication he relied on the va for care and received a 30 percent disability rating for ptsd brought on during his service he appealed the rating and encountered a bureaucratic nightmare clay had to wait months to see a psychiatrist at a va medical center two weeks later clay took his own life five weeks after his death and 18 months after filing an appeal with the va for his ptsd rating his appeal was approved clays story details the urgency that our nations heroes deserve the clay hunt sav act will increase access to mental health care and improve the quality of care troops and veterans receive together we can change this system so that no other veteran ever has to endure what thousands of veterans have already

the unitedstates marine corps until a neurological condition he suffered from eventually rendered him completely blind he received a 100 percent serviceconnected disability but that hasnt held him back daniel completed a blind rehabilitation program at the southern arizona va he enrolled at the university of arizona and was instrumental in establishing its student veterans center a place that

your comments and your concern for this significant problem i would like to take a moment to outline something that i have become aware of in my time here in office while this problem is very monumental there are many small things that the va can do right now to make a difference one of these changes can be made by the va immediately i would like to read a letter i received recently from an american legion representative in my district that illustrates the problem better than i could dear dr benishek here is the situation recently i encountered a suicidal veteran from the sault area who had severe ptsd 100 percent va disabled he called me on a wednesday hysterical and said that he was contemplating suicide he was traveling around with his wife in the car at the time i thought this was a very dangerous situation after several backandforth conversations with him i found out he was not taking any medicines and had not seen his va psychiatrist in a long time because as he put it the psychiatrist was not helping him and it seemed that he didnt really care he insisted that he stay at wilwin the american legion veterans facility but i told him we needed his psychiatrists okay as a veteran myself i thought i should try to help him the best that i could so i called the va suicide hotline to get answers on how i should handle the situation heres the problem i called the iron mountain va the call started out saying if you are having a medical or mental health emergency please hang up and dial 911 if you are having thoughts of hurting yourself and want to talk to a mental health professional please hang up and dial 1 800 273 if you are thinking of committing suicide you are already frustrated to the point that you would be glad to talk to anyone even if it is someone at the va can you imagine a veteran in this position even having a paper and pencil in hand to write the number down if he is unable to get the correct number the first time he must redial the va go through the whole spiel again and hopefully write the number on a paper the second or third time before he can try dialing once dialed the voice comes on the phone and says if you are a veteran push 1 and so on when i called the hotline after i pushed 1 listened to music for several minutes before a voice came on the phone she told me that she was not a veteran nor did she know much about ptsd veterans what i needed was advice on how to handle the veteran i was working with which she did give me how many veterans have committed suicide because of the vas red tape heres a solution when the va is called and the veteran is contemplating suicide or hurting himself you should be able to push 1 to get a direct line to the suicide hotline it should automatically register that the call is coming through the va system and yes it is a veteran calling this constituent was able to get the veteran he referred to the help that he needed but he raised an incredibly good point that i brought up repeatedly with the va the va told me it would take 6 months to change from an 800 number to simply dial 1 this is unacceptable i call on the va again today to make this change immediately i yield
