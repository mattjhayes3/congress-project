can best contribute to the debate by providing some comments and judgments on the nature of the presidents request my remarks are founded in the intelligence committees close monitoring and regular auditing of contra aid and particularly on information derived from the latest of frequent committee trips to central america the committee also carefully reviews intelligence reporting on central american issues finally our committee has thoroughly anafebruary 1988 february 1988 c o lyzed the details underlying the presidents requer t the adminisi ration ays that 36 2 million would s apport the contra forces for 4 2 months at what is described as an austere minimum essential level however an indepth examination of the presidents request reveals that this level of funding would both enhance and increase the contras capabilities the administration plans to provide more intelligence collection more communications and better command and control capability more aircraft with substantially greater airlift capacity better logistics support facilities more unitedstates ad isers and more propaganda activities in addition it should be made clear that the contra forces have increased during the period of nonlethal funding further not counting what may have already been cached inside nicaragua arms purchased in fiscal year 1907 armed those forces and could substantially continue to arm them for sevcral months after the february 29 cutoff that is why the lethal portion of the contra package is only 3 6 million all that the administration needs to do is fill in its arms inventory here and there to ensure a high level of military operations inside nicaragua that is why the presidents ncwest offerto defer the 3 6 million in lethal purchaseswont mean an end to military deliveries or military activity in fact 36 2 million will pay for an even higher level of military activity than before this is doubly striking when it is noted that combat levels during october november and december were higher than at any time in fiscal year 1987 that is because the contras fielded more troops inside nicaragua during that period and because the administration dropped more arms to them than it ever had before now the plan is to surge to even higher levels of combatall on the basis of this socalled austere request now what about the 1month hiatus in lethal deliveries promised by the administration there will be no hiatus in lethal activity only in lethal delivcry and that lethal activitycombatcould also increase above previous high levels because the delivery of arms to the contras in february will be beyond even the high delivery rates of the past the hiatus will be no hiatus at all lethal purchases and stockpiling will continue armed conflict will continue and even if there were to be a down turn in combat activity this simply ensures a stretchout in the contra war since the authority to deliver arms and other supplies to the contras will continue until tile last penny is spent a last comment on the administration requestwill it work the administration says the sandinistas are on tile ropes economically they say the contras have seized the military initialive and are conducting ever more effective operations in the field they say politically the sandinistas are increasingly unpopular the unspoken message here is that a contra military victory is nearly within reach it once again unmasks the ad 0nistrations constant and singleminded desire to force a military solution to the problems in central america the president does believe what he says when he calls the sandinists communists and reminds us that communisis never negotiate away power therefore negotiations inevitably will fall and the contras dont have to defeat the sandinistas tanks bnd helicopters all they have to do is bleed the sandinistas until they collapse on its merits this says two things about the policy that underlies contra aid the central american peace negotiations can frustrate a contra victory but call never ensure democracy and unless the administration is right and a sandinista collapse is imminent contra aid will have to continue

important facts about the earthquake in los angeles on october 1 properly called the whittier narrows earthquake and to indicate some of the lessons learned at 6 1 on the richter scale it killed seven people injured hundreds of others and caused over 200 million in damages twenty buildings were condemned and more than 2 000 homes were damaged the earthquake struck at 7 42 had it occurred a little later when more people were up and about the injuries could have been much greater the event should be looked upon as a scaleddown preview of the socalled big one expected to be a thousand times stronger than this recent event with a 5050 chance of occurring in the next 30 to 50 years the big earthquake is predicted to kill up to 14 000 people seriously injure another 50 000 and cause tens of billions of dollars in property damage having come so far in learning to live with damaging earth tremors we still have a long way to go and much to learn this earthquake provides an opportunity to learn some important lessons at my request the subcommittee on science research and technology of the science space and technology committee will be holding hearings tomorrow at 1 in 2318 rayburn to explore lessons to be learned from this most recent earthquake the first lesson and the easiest 0 swallow is that our hazard mitigati~n strategies such as stiffer building codes and improved emergency pieparedness procedures can be succepsful these hazard mitigation efforts were well in place when the earthquake struck and are credited tor saving over 10 000 lives and preventiag a great deal of property damage the second lesson is that although better prepared than all other regions california is not ready for a major quake that is one greater than eight on the richter scale thousands of buildings still need to be retofitted and preparedness and response activities need constant refinement los angeles alone has more than 7 000 yearold masonry buildings only 1 000 of which have been reinforceed under a 1981 ordinance that required that all be strengthened or demolished by 1992 there is much work to be done many buildings to be retrofitted in addition we can build safer new structures both public and private and we have learned where not to place them building our cities to smirvive earthquakes with minimal damage and minimal loss of life is one of our best defenses against catastrophe a third lesson is frightehiing and should be taken very seriousil despite all the exciting and inva juable advances in our understanding of how the earths crustal plates keep in constant motion and the enormous amount of seismic research conduqted in california it is not clear to seismologists whether or not the earthquake fell on a known fault in addition of the two distinct tectonic systems reshaping the los angeles basinthe san andreas ana the transverse range systemsscientists are still not sure which fault system was related to the quake the location of the earthquake suggests that the responsible fault belongs to the san andreas system but the nature of the faulting suggests the transverse range system is responsible seismologists at the usgs have stated that they would not have anticipated a quake at that particular location we can all appreciate that knowing where the earthquake will strike is more important than knowing exactly when it will strike certainly establishments located in highrisk areas will take more precautionary measures than those located far from an active fault system clearly more research is needed earthquake prediction which saves lives and allows for improved emergency response is still in its infancy it may be that the best defense that the los angeles basin has is additional time and resources for a stepped up research program in addition research that has been primarily focused on the san andreas system should be extended to other areas a fourth lesson involves a consideration of how a large earthquake is likely to affect not only the economy of california but that of the united states we need to take a serious look at the insurance situation as well as the possibility of a plan for major government backing in any future seismic disaster although all homeowner insurance companies in los angeles are required to offer earthquake insurance only about 15 percent of california homeowners have such coverage among the policies that do exist the premiums and deductible amounts are high while the maximum coverage is low the rates do not match individual situations such as proximity to a major fault zone or the structural integrity of the insured building also public information about risk reduction is severely lacking insurance policies should not make it attractive to build over active faults or in areas of high likelihood of ground failure insurance can and should be an important incentive for hazard mitigation and an instrument of economic recovery insurance industry officials with the encouragement of federal officials are preparing a plan for financial assistance from the federal government in the event of a large earthquake the need for such a plan rests in the possibility of a financial collapse from a catastrophic earthquake given the possibility of 70 billion in damage claims after a magnitude 8 quake the insurance industry should have the promise of federal assistance without a national earthquake or natural hazards insurance program our ability to restore homes and businesses could be severely threatened the rewards for taking heed to these lessons and responding accordingly could be tremendous the penalty for not doing so could be tremendously devastating"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise today to commend those members of the judiciary committee who joined me in the 99th congress on october 17 1986 to request of the attorney general of the united states that an independent counsel be appointed to pursue the revelations that were coming forward from the downing of a c123 cargo plane on october 5 of that same year laden with munitions that seemed to have apparently been involved with private efforts to support the contras from this humble beginning and the outpouring of other events related to this we now find ourselves in the incredible and very difficult situation that now engulfs the executive branch of the government so i wanted to thank my colleagues the gentleman from california mr don edwards the gentleman from connecticut mr bruce morrison the gentleman from michigan mr george crockett the gentleman from massachusetts mr barney frank the gentleman from wisconsin mr robert kastenmeier our former colleague from ohio john seiberling the gentlewoman from colorado mrs patricia schroeder the gentleman from california mr howard berman the gentleman from ohio mr feighan and the gentleman from west virginia mr staggers those colleagues of ours on the judiciary committee it seems to me have done a very very important service to this nation in determining that long ago some 5 months ago we were in need of an independent counsel to investigate these activities in connection with that petition to the courts and to the attorney general it was required that we present some theory of the activities that would justify the courts complying with our request that an independent counsel or special prosecutor be appointed so we had to construct from that point of view some indication of a factual nature as to what may have happened that would require the granting of our request and i would like now to just go back over that with the members we must remember that this was back in october of 1986 and here is the submission that we made to the department of justice we said this it has been reported that in december 1983 a series of meetings involving lt col oliver north central intelligence agency director william casey the vice president of the united states george bush thenwhite house counselor edwin meese theninterior secretary william clark and president ronald reagan and others took place to plan a supply network to the contras it is said that these efforts were undertaken in anticipation of congressional prohibitions on aid to the armed rebels lt col oliver north is reported to have been given principal responsibility in administering the supply operation and is reported to have had frequent contact with the contras through intermediaries including united states general retired singlaub and robert owen donald gregg the vice presidents national security advisor and retired general richard secord were also detailed to assist the coordination of the network it is also reported that the unitedstates officials planned to fund the nicaraguan rebels through highly unusual and illegal methods on november 25 1986 attorney general edwin meese acknowledged in a press conference that funds obtained from arms sales to iran had been transferred to the nicaraguan contras lt col oliver north and national security advisor john poindexter were said to be immediately involved several trips to iran paid for with united states funds seem to have been made by united states officials or representatives to discuss arrangements news organizations reported that chief of staff donald regan had been informed and approved the details of the iran arms sales it also was reported by news organizations on november 27 1986 that documents might have been destroyed relating to the arms sales to iran and benefits from those sales derived and forwarded to the contras the initial supply network plan was reportedly drafted by lt col oliver north and to have been approved by thennational security council counselor robert mcfarlane and president reagan from 1984 to 1986 when direct or indirect unitedstates official involvement with the contras was prohibited by law the supply network seems to have flourished the supply network seemed to involve the use of unitedstates funds at air bases and elsewhere in violation of unitedstates law unitedstates officials were alleged to have been involved in and knowledgeable of activities that may have constituted felonies including illegal arms shipments neutrality law violations foreign agents registration act violations and other criminal acts during the 2 years in which legal prohibitions on involvement with the contras were in place key individuals who say that they were involved in the supply efforts claimed to have frequent contact with administration officials and that their activities were known to those officials general singlaub for instance who acknowledged publicly his principal role in the supply efforts said in a 60 minutes interview with mike wallace on october 5 1986 that he kept informed cia director william casey about his activities in supplying the contras with military aid and received encouragement from him there were also reports singlaub acknowledged clearing his actions with north and meeting frequently with cia director william j casey the hearst syndicate also reported on may 15 1986 that general singlaub operating with unitedstates gov ernment approval agreed to provide arms and other supplies to nicaraguan rebel leader eden pastora also during the time in which the restrictions were in place public funds are reported to have been used to assist efforts to supply the contras department of defense funds are said to have been used to upgrade military airfields at ilopango in el salvador aguacate jamastran and mocoron funds are also reported to have been used to maintain safehouses pay telephone bills and other activities that may be directly related to the supply network flight logs also showed that pilots involved in the supply efforts including one killed in the october 5 downing of the c123 which had eugene hasenfus aboard had flown to sensitive unitedstates military bases including bases inside the united states where classified military research is conducted individuals receiving public moneys including official contracts seem to have been involved in aiding the contras and administering the supply network john hull an american with cia connections who lives in costa rica is reported to have received 10 000 monthly from the nsc in 1984 and 1985 to coordinate contra operations it was alleged during that time that robert owen who received contracts from nhao used oliver norths office in his capacity as unofficial liason to the contras and fundraiser for them it is also reported that robert owen worked to aid the contras through private channels while working as a consultant to the nhao at the state department two sources are said to have told senator kerrys staff that they witnessed owen engaged in arranging a weapons transaction with adolfo calero in the united states in the period when the boland amendment was in force illegal arms shipments were alleged to have transpired and the office of the unitedstates attorney commenced investigation into them in miami one such shipment seems to have originated from fort lauderdalehollywood fl airport on march 6 1985 and was coordinated by john hull and robert owen who met the shipment at ilopango military base in el salvador francisco chanes who is an official of legal humanitarian aid is also alleged to have been involved in the arms shipment any administration involvement in this incident or knowledge of it and failure to report it could constitute a criminal violation key law enforcement officials who may have feared public and congressional reaction to revelations of illegalities on the part of the contras and their associates may have exerted pressure to slow or halt the investigation at this point information obtained by senator kerry does not seem to have been acknowledged or acted upon at that time two unnamed law enforcement officials in an interview said that attorney general meese and former deputy attorney general lowell jensen applied pressure to slow the investigation of illegal arms shipment from hollywood airport the c123 cargo plane downed on october 5 1986 revealed additional information an identification card found in the wreckage of the downed c123 identified captured flier eugene hasenfus as an adviser in the unitedstatesa group at the ilopango air base in el salvador entrance onto the base by americans was said to require approval by unitedstates officials hasenfus it had been frequently reported was recruited by members of the network established by the administration an unnamed salvadoran familiar with cia activities in el salvador and also knowledgeable of the supply operation is quoted as saying do you think the salvadoran government would let hundreds of guns and big airplanes fly in and out of here for more than a year taking stuff to the guerrillas if the united states government didnt tell them to approving access to the base maintained with unitedstates funds could constitute unauthorized assistance subsequently hasenfus is quoted as saying that 24 to 26 cia personnel acted as flight crews and maintenance crews that they were also involved in refueling of flights that came through ilopango and that they helped create the flight plans all fuel at ilopango is thought to be purchased by either the cia the pentagon or the unitedstates military aid program at a press conference hasenfus is reported to say that max gomez and another cia employee were responsible for the logistics and flight plans for private contra supply flights mr gomez it is recalled was recommended by none other than the vice president of the united states national advisor mr donald gregg to the salvadoran air force as a counterinsurgency specialist and the distinguished vice president of the united states mr busn and mr gregg are reported to have met with gomez on at least two occasions mr gomez is also reported to have dined with the ambassador to el salvador mr edwin corr the ambassador stated at one point that he did not know mr gomez several days after that statement an embassy spokesman retracted the ambassadors comments there are indications that unitedstates funds were used to support gomezs activities at a time when such support was specifically prohibited by law in a report in october 27 of last year it was stated that three salvadoran workers were paid by the unitedstates embassy to work on mr max gomezs house in addition the captured flier mr hasenfus claims to have stayed at mr gomezs residence located at 5272 pasco escalon in san salvador when a reporter an american reporter attempted to visit the location and gain entry it is reported that armed security agents carrying unitedstates embassy identification cards appeared promptly at the scene the reporter was turned away also in october of last year captured flights and record logs show that at least 15 private flights carrying weapons to resupply the contras originated at the honduran military base of aguacate and some used the airfield at mocoron both improved with unitedstates military exercise funds but unitedstates spokesmen for the exercises insisted that the airfields were only used to give american soldiers practice in field construction techniques and said they would not be used for or by the contras because of laws prohibiting indirect or direct aid to the contras captured flight logs also record trips to highly sensitive unitedstates military bases including one in nevada that is said to have conducted classified military research nicaraguan troops are said to have recovered a navigational targeting instrument from the cockpit of the plane which mr hasenfus said was placed there by the central intelligence agency to allow pilots to make more accurate drops of weapons shipments phone bills from a safe house in san salvador where mr hasenfus and others stayed are reported to show numerous calls to lieutenant colonel norths private line at the national security council in the capital of our nation the phone records show a series of calls to mr norths colonel norths office arms merchants and air supply companies were involved in these telephonic transactions it is suspected that the unitedstates government paid for these phone bills as unnamed unitedstates official is quoted as saying that the economic support funds for el salvador honduras and guatemala had been diverted and were critical to the supply network any number of other events reported including that of richard secords involvement in arranging for third parties to supply the contras including key officials and individuals in saudi arabia in possible exchange for a favorable disposition of the awac deal of saudi arabia have been noted it is also reported that the attorney general of the united states edwin meese and deputy attorney general donald jensen applied pressure on the office of the unitedstates attorney to halt or slow the investigation into illegalities emanating out of contra supply efforts as it might have interfered with the administrations foreign policy goals this was information that the members of the judiciary committee provided the attorney general and ultimately the threeman federal court in asking for an independent counsel and suggesting possible alleged illegal efforts by the unitedstates officials to assist the contras that involved such conflicts of duty on the part of the attorney general and others in the department of justice that an independent counsel should be appointed and i am very very pleased of course to suggest to you that they were appointed and that mr walsh is on the job and is proceeding forthwith there was yet another part of our response to the department of justice the request for an independent counsel that suggested to them as was required under our interpretation of the law to elicit the statutes that might have been violated what crimes what criminal statutes might these unitedstates government officials have violated in their overenthusiastic efforts to assist the contras we set forward a number of them among them was title 18 section 641 of the

exception have reiterated that view in word and deed for 40 years yet it is precisely because of the unremitting hostility israel has faced during its four decades that both its survival and

exceptions yes there are flaws which are inherent in any democratic society yes the pictures on the nightly news in 1988 are troubling sewing doubt and confusion in the minds of even israels stronger

israels military edge as well as our capacity to maintain stability in the middle east lihe threat to israel is not negligible for example despite deep reductions in oil revenues saudi arabia continues to order weapons on a grand scale it leads the arab states in military expenditures this year alone they are spending over 18 billion on the militarya sum more than 75 percent of israels

whether we like it or not we live by perceptions of what other people think of us and what they think of our laws and i can tell you from actual experience that people around the world look upon the gephardt proposal as being a proposal that sets up surpluses in and of themselves to be unfair practice a practice that we should not be tolerating that will lead us into serious problems in the future when we will as we certainly must and as we certainlyas certain as night follows day after we run this series of deficits that we are now in the dollar and the yen and the other currencies realign themselves we are going to run some very large surpluses we are going to have to as a matter of policy and as matter of survival run these surpluses if we start off by saying that surpluses of themselves are bad we have set a trap for america from which we can never recover now there is no economist worth his salt who will not tell you that when the currency finishes realigning itselfand i think there is going to be plenty more depreciation of the dollar and appreciation of the yen before it is overthat america will be highly competitive around the world we unfortunately are not now but we will be and we certainly will deal with this reevaluation that is going on history shows us that and every sound bit of reasoning shows us that so if we set up surpluses as being a mistaken practice we are going to have to live with that and when we do and when we start running these surpluses in america in the 1990s we are going to be caught in a position that we intractably cannot get out of we will have burdened ourselves with a policy that will defeat us and make us a poorer nation that is a problem with mr gxrhardts amendment and whether he admits that or not or whether he

in our overall budget in the billions of dollars in the 1990s mainly because we will be building up a huge surplus in the social security fund that will amount to some 13 trillion and our budget

of h r 5 the school improvement act of 1989 which reauthorizes 14 major elementary and secondary education programs the most important programs are of course chapter 1 which provides supplemental education for economically disadvantaged children and chapter 2 which provides state block grants for needy school districts to improve basic skills development the legislation also extends a number of programs authorized under the elementary and secondary education act creates a new program for gifted children and focuses new resources on math and sclence basic skills dropout prevention and drug abuse prevention as a former teacher and school board member i am acutely aware of the need for legislation such as this that encourages and rewards excellence in education and provides necessary assistance to children who might otherwise never catch up with their more fortunate classmates however i must reiterate my belief that the role of the federal government in education is a limited one local governments are clearly best equipped to know what their particular community needs most they are attuned to the priorities of the community they share its values local governments are also in a better position to fund certain programs some states have actually enjoyed budget surpluses whilethe federal government continues to grapple with an enormous deficit this particular legislation will cost us 4 billion next year i think it is apparent that we must work toward limiting federal involvement in education i am grateful that the committee accepted my amendments to the education provisions of the antidrug abuse act of 1986 the roukema amendments provide for the inclusion of youth suicide prevention programs in the authorized drug abuse prevention programs the amendments are particularly timely in light of the recent wave of highly publicized teenage suicides as some of you may be aware in march of this year four young people in my congressional district committed suicide together there is no doubt that suicide among teenagers is among the most serious social problems in that group suicide is a leading cause of death among persons between the ages of 15 and 24 second only to traffic fatalities the number of young people taking their lives has increased greatly in the last few decades last week the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education held hearings on teenage suicide prevention a distinguished panel of experts offered their advice on how to prevent these tragedies the experts confirmed that there is a well established relationship between drug abuse and youth suicide my amendment recognizes this connection between drug problems and other problems facing our young people i would like to commend my colleagues mr hawkins and mr goodling for their excellent work in forging a bipartisan bill there is one program included in h r 5 about which i do have serious reservationsthat is the bilingual education act i have long been a critic of the bilingual education program for its failure to recognize the need to teach english to nonenglish speaking~children as early as possible as you know federal law mandates that school districts receiving money for bilingual education must teach in the native language of the school children this method has not proven effective this years bill will allow additional funding for alternative teaching methods such as immersion and english as a second language while this provides some flexibility i believe the legislation should have gone much further bilingual education programs should be geared toward getting school children assimilated into englishspeaking classes rapidly and effectively the in ability to speak english can severely hamper a citizens ability to participate fully in the mainstream of america we should not hestitate to support educational methods that ensure such participation i would like to make a statement on behalf of the chairman and the vice chairman of the committee and the excellent work that they have done an editorial in the washington post of april 22 entitled an education bill without losers quite correctly commends the leaders of our committee and members of the committee for developing a bill that will singularly help education in this country and there are all winners and no losers the editorial follows"],

congress by introducing h r 1398 the quality of life action act i am proud to note to my colleagues that i am a cosponsor of that act as well the gentleman in communicating with our office regarding his bill noted on april 3 that the national unemployment rate has remained unchanged in recent months and is now at about 6 7 percent as he rightfully pointed out in his communication every one of those people who are out of work representing that 6 7 percent nationally is a tragedy on an individual basis in the district i represent in northwest indiana however the picture is much bleaker than the national statistics would indicate during the last month our unnemployment rate in essentially lake and porter counties in indiana was at 12 9 percent and it represents 28 134 individuals who could not last month find work in northeast indiana people in our area have taken solace in the unemployment rate at 12 9 percent which is down from previous levels but i remind those people however that between the years of 1980 and 1985 we lost 30 000 workers out of our work force and they are simply gone so to be proud of the fact that we have an unemployment rate of only 12 9 percent in northwest indiana just east of our neighbors district that is double the national average and is unconscionable we must as a government face this problem and we must act i congratulate the gentleman not just for his introduction of h r 1398 but also for his extra efforts on the house education and labor committee it was during the past week that the gentleman offered an amendment to the elementary and secondary education act to improve the situation that we find ourselves in as far as those who are potential dropouts in our school system to ensure that everyone does have that equal chance for an education and fundamentally he also recognizes that aspect in his legislation that is before the house today we have in gary in high schools that will shortly be graduating approximately 3 000 students this will now be the third graduation i have seen in gary in about 1 000 of those students will go on to college or to military service another thousand will potentially find some type of employment in northwest indiana albeit at a much lower wage rate than we have historically experienced in that area but most importantly approximately 1 000 of those young people and i remind my colleagues that 98 percent of the gary school system is nonwhite are not going to find that first job come june they are not going to find that first job come september and they are going to be a drain not only on themselves and their selfrespect but on the entire community and on this nation we must act to solve this problem we must act not just for those who are jobless but also as my colleague from illinois mr hayes has pointed on april 3 for those who are underemployed i had a conference in washington dc earlier today and the question was raised about whether or not i supported the increase in the minimum wage i said absolutely i do when you have 1 1 million people in the united states of america today who make the minimum wage and who live below the poverty level that wage rate that floor to protect the individuals in our society must be raised these are some of the concerns that i bring to this house today again i wish to congratulate my colleague from illinois for this tireless efforts on behalf of those in our society less able to defend themselves and i join him again in trying to push this legislation"]]}
