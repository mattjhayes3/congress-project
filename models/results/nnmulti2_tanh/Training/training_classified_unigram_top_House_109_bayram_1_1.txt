future due to the rising cost of our debt our deficit we believe it is time to restore some common sense in fiscal discipline to our nations government i stand here today on the floor of the united states house of representatives as a voice for the people of arkansas fourth congressional district it is one thing for all of us to have the title unitedstates representative but it is another thing to be one and i believe it is important that we go back to our respective districts i go home every weekend to places like hot springs and texarkana and pine bluff and el dorado and mena and hope and arkandelphia and throughout the 29 counties and 150 towns that i so proudly represent and listen to the people and then i do my best to bring their voice back here to the floor of the unitedstates house of representatives the people are telling me that it is time that our nation get its fiscal house in order and stop this reckless spending that has resulted in the largest deficit ever in our nations history for a fifth year in a row and has resulted in a debt that totals 8 137 trillion that is 8 trillion 137 billion and some change in fact for every man woman and child in this country if w6 all had to get our checkbooks out tonight and retire this debt everybody including the children the babies being born today would have to write a check for some 27 000 you hear a lot of talk these days about this being a democratic idea or this being a republican idea and i am here to tell you that i believe the people in this country like me are sick and tired of all the partisan bickering that goes on at our nations capital it should not matter if it is a democratic idea or a republican idea in fact the american people are concerned not about petty partisan politics but they are concerned about paying for the high cost of their childrens college education the skyrocketing cost of health care and how to pay for prescription drugs they are concerned about their retirement security about privatizing social security medicare and medicaid skyrocketing natural gas and energy prices the war in iraq and thousands of katrina victims who nearly 4 months after the devastating hurricane still today remain homeless let me tell you about my america my congressional district back home in arkansas ranks 415 out of 435 among congressional districts throughout the country in average income per household half the children in arkansas are on medicaid eight out of ten seniors in nursing homes are on medicaid one in five people in my home state of arkansas are on medicaid yet around 1 oclock in the morning on november 18 congress nearly passed the socalled deficit reduction act that would directly and adversely impact the poor the disabled the elderly this bill mandates nearly 50 billion in spending cuts including 11 4 billion in cuts to medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor the disabled the elderly 14 3 billion in cuts to federal student aid programs over 3 billion in cuts to our farm families and over 700 million in cuts to food stamps then the republican leadership turns around and passes 56 billion worth of tax cuts 50 billion in spending cuts 56 billion in tax cuts only in washington do you add 6 billion to the nations debt and call it the deficit reduction act i will never stop fighting for the conservative smalltown values that i was raised on and still believe in and i cannot help but reflect on one of the memory verses that i learned growing up at midway united methodist church just outside prescott arkansas it is from matthew 25 40 and it goes like this i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me mr speaker the idea of cutting programs that would negatively impact the poorest among u does not resonate with the principles on which this country was founded these budget cuts are indicative of misguided priorities and do not reflect the values i learned growing up in places like emmet prescott and hope arkansas as members of the blue dog coalition we believe we have the answer to this massive debt this ongoing deficit and we believe we can get it under control without harming and cutting programs for the poorest among us it is called the blue dog 12point plan it is 12 simple points quite frankly that if irpplemented would truly restore some fiscal discipline and common sense to our nations government this evening we plan to spend the remaining part of this hour going over these 12 points so many people criticize what is going on but they do not offer up a solution and what we are trying to do as members of the blue dog coalition isoffer up an alternative offer up a solution to this massive debt and deficit this budget problem our nation has today with me to help do that i am real proud to have john tanner one of the founding members of the blue dog coalition from the state of tennessee dennis cardoza one of the cochairs of the blue dog coalition from california and allen boyd from florida one of the founding members longtime members former chairman of the blue dog coalition so we come to you this evening from all across america from arkansas and tennessee and california and florida to offer up what we believe are commonsense ideas to truly try to get this nations fiscal house back in order as 37 members of congress we have come together and we have written this 12point reform and we are encouraging democrats and re publicans to join us as we try to get this nation back on track and the reason this is so important and why this should matter to everybody across our land 8 137 trillion in debt that is very important for a lot of reasons not the least of which is our nation today the first 500 million we collect every day in taxes from taxpayers does not go to better roads better education better health care it simply goes to pay interest to pay interest on the national debt it is not getting any better in fact our

clumsy response to hurricane katrina this congress has a proven history of lax oversight of the administration and i do not believe it can be trusted in this case to undertake a truly independent and probing inquiry like most americans i welcomed the resignation of fema director michael brown he proved himself grossly underqualified for the important job of fema chief the key position for coordinating governmental response to domestic catastrophes his previous professional experience with the arabian horse association proved inadequate training for the awesome challenges any fema chief can expect to face mr browns appointment to this critical position when compared to his woeful qualifications reveals a disturbing willingness to place cronyism over competence mr browns unjustifiable appointment to fema is not the only outrage in the katrina tragedy president bush himself has acknowledged his own failure and that of the entire bush administration as the floodwaters rose and the cries went out from stranded victims george bush seemed not to notice only when his handlers realized the gravity of the situationdays after federal action could have preempted untold numbers of deathsdid the president rouse himself from the vigors of ranch life and deign to respond this he did by cutting his fiveweek vacation short by two days and dipping the wing of air force one as he jetted by the american people witnessed the bush administration negligent response to hurricane katrina and they want a full account of the political and systemic shortfalls that contributed to the inept and late federal response that is why so many americans oppose a partisan committee like the one proposed in this legislation in fact 71 percent of the public said that the proposed congressional investigation would get bogged down in politics rather than focusing on the facts such skepticism is wellfounded the republican majority of this congress consistently refuses to ask tough questions of the administration or hold it responsible for its misguided policies and outright dishonesty the congress for example did not probe the administrations faulty rationale for war with iraq unlawful disclosure of a cia agents identity deceptive cost estimates for its prescription drug proposal and unethical dealings with energy lobbyists having turned a collective blind eye to these wrongdoings there is no reason to believe that congress will suddenly reverse course and put national interests above their political loyalty to president bush a recent poll revealed that 76 percent of americans support the creation of an independent commission akin to the one formed by congress after the september 11 terrorist attacks my democratic colleagues and i have proposed just such a commission to examine the conduct of the federal government including the congress before during and immediately after hurricane katrina swept through the gulf coast region many in washington dc prefer a partisan inquiry into the federal governments response to the worst disaster in a nations history but rpy constituents have been clear the governments response was appalling and they want a

gentleman for yielding me this time and more importantly for his distinguished leadership on many issues concerning americas working families i know i speak for all our colleagues when i say it is a privilege to call the gentleman from new york colleague i also extend my thanks to the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on trade the gentleman from maryland for his very very substantive review of this cafta treaty it has been an enormous help to members and i thank him for his leadership as well i rise in strong opposition to the central american free trade agreement it is a small treaty economically but it has enormous implications for our country i oppose cafta because it is a step backward for workers in central america and a job killer here at home as a californian and there are many of us in the chamber this evening we all know full well the significance of our close ties to central america my own city of san francisco is blessed with large populations of central americans including those who sought sanctuary from el salvador and those fleeing decades of civil war in guatemala our fate is tied with our neighbors in the hemisphere president john f kennedy recognized this in 1961 when he announced the alliance for progress calling for vast multilateral programs to relieve the continents poverty and social inequities the alliance for progress included both economic cooperation and called for economic reforms as conditions of participation just as we call for stronger labor and environmental standards today as the reasonable condition for trade agreements i wish that the cafta bill we are debating tonight were an agreement that opened markets included basic labor standards and protected our environment this type of agreement would have lifted the economies of both the united states and central america it would have attracted support from a large number of democratic members who have long histories of supporting free and fair trade including recent trade agreements with australia singapore chile morocco jordan vietnam and cambodia unfortunately that is not the type of trade agreement before us tonight instead we are considering a trade agreement that protnotes a race to the bottom that hurts unitedstates workers that turns back the clock on basic internationally accepted worker protections and fails to protect the environment as a result the republican leadership is having a hard time convincing its own members to vote for this bill we have heard our colleague earlier the gentleman from ohio talking about twisting arms until they are broken into a thousand pieces the new york times today the gentleman referenced the new york times so i will too said that a white house official said that the last votes are likely to be won with the most expensive deals we should be able to pass good fair trade agreement treaties on their merits instead the administration is trying to persuade people with side bars side letters and side deals they have never worked in the past they are just a con and i hope that our colleagues will not fall for the con in their desperation to win votes the president and the republican leadership in the house have also proclaimed that cafta here tonight will promote unitedstates security and democracy in central america the truth is if we want to improve our national security and promote democracy there we should heed the words of pope paul vi who said if you want peace work for justice trade alone devoid of basic living and working standards has not and will not promote security nor will it lift developing nations out of poverty our national security will not be improved by exploiting workers in central america here at home this cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions i repeat here at home cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions we have lost 2 8 million manufacturing jobs since president bush took office cafta does not solve the jobs problem it only digs the hole deeper these downward pressures create a race to the bottom that needlessly threaten unitedstates jobs nothing in this agreement will help raise substandard wages in central america or help create a strong middle class that has the disposable income to buy unitedstates goods democrats understandthe need to help our central american neighbors reap the benefits of increased trade but the cost of this cafta are too high with too little to justify this agreements deficiencies we must have basic worker protections which ensure that our trading partners abide by the most fundamefntal standards of common decency and fairness the cafta we are debating today fails to promote these basic measures of decency and fairness and in fact takes a step backward from current law because it removes the requirement from these countries to abide by the workers rights standards of the international labor standards when it comes to the environment democrats believe that environmental principles must be a central part of the core trade agreement cafta will do absolutely nothing to

governments including our own for compensation if the environmental laws reduce the value of their investment or cut their profits i repeat cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if an environmental law reduces the value of their investment or cuts into their profits cafta places no value on the environmental health of the americas moreover the enforcement provisions of this cafta are virtually nonexistent it merely calls for cafta countries to enforce their own laws enforcement in these areas must be written in to cafta if they are to be effective they are not democrats believe that to keep america in the lead the nation must adopt a bold new and sustained commitment to technological innovation and educational excellence that commitment would ensure that our country remains competitive and vibrant against formidable international competition generating highquality jobs throughout the 21st century we are committed to addressing challenges of increasing competitive global market our economic future rests on our ability to innovate new products and to create new markets for those goods and services we insist that this administration revisit its flawed trade policy and work with democrats so that we can pass free trade agreements including a new improved cafta that will expand markets spur economic growth protect the environment and raise living standards in the united states and abroad that would allow us to move forward with our other priorities american families are facing serious challenges rising health care costs record gas prices climbing college costs and massive job layoffs they are worried about the direction of our country instead of addressing the serious issues that directly affect americas families and coming up with real solutions repgblicans have abused their power and focused on the wrong priorities pursuing an energy bill that does nothing to lower gas prices or a social security privatization plan that weakens the safety net for americas elderly sadly this trade agreement and the way it has been pursued by the administration has become yet another example of those misplaced priorities and missed opportunities again president kennedy said in 1961 that the united states and latin america are firm and ancient friends united by history and experience and by our determination to advance the values of american civilization we must support all economic integration which is a genuine step toward larger markets and greater competitive opportunity it was true then it is an inspiration now i urge my colleagues to send this cafta back to the drawing board the administration can negotiate a new cafta that will open new markets include basic labor standards and protect the environment such an agreement would attract strong bipartisan support this cafta does none of the above it does not protect the environment it does not grow the economy in our country it does not lift the living standard in central america and it does not have my support vote no on this cafta"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i thank the gentleman from american samoa for adding so much information to this presentation because i think that when people listen and hear what it is that we are sharing with this country there may be many many people out there that say i did not know that although we talk about many firsts accomplishments from members of our communities i am sure also that those who are first expect never to be last that they would continue that we would continue to contribute to this country and in order to contribute to our country we have to also defend the constitution defending the constitution and defending the rights of our people also entails the voting rights this past week h r 9 the voting rights act reauthorization was introduced the right to vote is keenly felt by the asian and pacific islander american community chinese americans could not vote until the chinese exclusion acts of 1882 and 1892 were repealed in 1943 firstgeneration japanese americans could not vote until 1952 because of the racial restrictions contained in the 1790 naturalization law with the markup in judiciary committee tomorrow we need to ensure that important provisions such as section 203 which has been very vital to the api communitys ability to participate in the electoral process gets reauthorized in this congress languageminority citizens were often denied needed assistance at the polls in the 1975 amendments to the voting rights act such assigtance became required in certain situations and we need to ensure that these provisions continue to remain in current law as americans we need to ensure that our children receive a quality education but also provide adequate teacher training funds for afterschool and extracurricular activities and ensuring that college is affordable for every student that deserves to receive a higher education according to the unitedstates census 50 percent of asians age 25 and over have a bachelors degree or higher level of education however i would like to emphasize that when we disaggregate the data when we tease apart the information for the api subgroups we find that the model minority stereotype is in fact a myth only 9 1 percent of cambodian americans 7 4 percent hmong americans 7 6 lao americans 19 5 percent vietnamese americans and 16 percent of native hawaiians and pacific islanders who are 25 years and older have a bachelors degree these numbers show that we must do a better job of disaggregating data and information about our communities to assess the needs of those hardworking americans who still falter behind to address the disparities between subgroups of the larger apia community we need congress to pass the asian american and pacific islander serving institutions bill which my colleague from oregon congressman david wu will be introducing later this month this legislation will provide federal grants to colleges and universities that have an enrollment of undergraduate students that is at least 10 percent apia and at least 50 percent of its degreeseeking students receive financial assistance as a caucus we will work to increase the availability of loan assistance scholarships and programs to allow apia students to attend a higher education institution to ensure full funding for teachers and bilingual education programs under the no child left behind law to support english language learners and to support full funding of minority outreach programs for access to higher education such as the trio programs to expand services to serve apia students a common misperception of apias is that as a group we face fewer health problems than other racial and ethnic groups in fact apias as a group and specific populations within this group do experience disparities in health and health care for example apias have the highest hepatitis b rates of any racial group in the united states apias are also five times more likely to develop cervical and liver cancer than any other ethnic and racial group according to the census bureau 18 percent of apias went without insurance for the entire year in 2000 this means that the uninsured are not only more likely to go without care for serious medical conditions they are also more likely to go without routine care less likely to have a regular source of care less likely to use preventive services and have fewer visits per year at the same time without appropriate language translation services or properly translated materials limitedenglishproficient immigrants cannot receive adequate care as well as state and federal benefits for which they may be eligible in the apia community 76 percent of hmong americans 61 percent of vietnamese americans 52 percent of korean americans and 39 percent of tongans speak limited english therefore eliminating health care disparities in the apia community must include data collection linguistically appropriate and culturally competent services and access to health insurance capac has been working with both the congressional hispanic and black caucuses on the health care equality and accountability act to eliminate ethnic and racial health disparities for all of our communities i have introduced the health care equality and accountability act which will address expanding the health care safety net by diversifying the health care workforce combating diseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities emphasizing prevention and behavioral health and promoting the collection and dissemination of data and enhanced medical research i would also like to extend my gratitude to the patriotic men and women serving our country in the military including the 60 813 apias serving on active duty in the unitedstates armed services as well as the 28 066 in the reserves and the national guard i also commend and thank the 351 000 apia veterans who fought for this country i would like to highlight and honor the filipino veterans as my colleague had done who have not been compensated and recognized for their service which i believe is a national disservice to these brave veterans as a country it is our duty to ensure that these veterans have equal access to all the benefits and treatment that other veterans receive we believe that our troops should be taken care of when we send them into battle and that they should be given the respect when they return home therefore i stand with my colleagues congressman issa and congressman filner to support their bipartisan legislation h r 4574 to restore full benefits to these veterans who fought for our nation during world war h with congressman issa taking the lead and congressman filner in a leadership position in the veterans affairs committee we have a great chance to get this bill to the floor in honor of the centennial celebration of filipinos in hawaii and to keep the word of congress that we gave to these brave veterans of world war ii i am proud of our communitys accomplishment and i would like to recognize many of the apia firsts in areas of art film sports sciences academia and politics in each effort these folks who were first expect that they are not the last in 1847 yung wing the first chinese american graduated from yale university and the first apia to graduate from a unitedstates college in 1863 william ah hang who was chinese american became the first apia to enlist in the u s navy during the civil war in 1944 an wang a chinese american who invented the magnetic core memory revolutionized computing and served as a standard method for memory retrieval and storage in 1946 wing f ong a chinese american from arizona became the first apia to be elected to state office in 1948 victoria manalo draves a filipino american diver became the first woman to win olympic gold medals in both the 10 meter platform and the 3 meter spring board events in 1956 dalip singh saud the first indian american to be elected to congress in 1965 patsy takemoto mink the first japanese woman and woman of color elected to congress who championed title ix in 1985 haing ngor a cambodian american became the first apia to win an academy award for his role in the movie killing fields in 1985 ellison onizuka a japanese american became the first apia astronaut whose life was lost in a launching tragedy in conclusion the asian american pacific islander american community continues to fight for our civil liberties and our civil rights as americans even after the internment of the japanese americans during world war ii we as a community did not grow embittered or cowed by discrimination instead we progressed and moved forward i am proud to be a member of the apia community because we continue to serve as positive contributors to our many communities by investing in education business and cultural opportunities for all americans in closing this asian pacific american heritage month we take pride in our history accomplishments and the promise of our future as we continue to pave the way for a better tomorrow in the name of dreams and challenges of asian pacific americans the 6 years i have served here i learned that asian americans have a unique contribution to make to this body and to this country and that we because of our history in this country uniquely understand and recognize that our constitution is never tested in times of tranquility our constitution is always tested in times of trauma terror tension and tragedy and to the point where we can internalize the principles of our bill of rights and our constitution and to the point where we understand that defending this constituion and its people will we be able to face as members of this body face overwhelming public approval which could be wrong and stand up to them say it is wrong because it does not follow the constitution these are the kinds of heritage and

tremendous ally of indian country and anyone who doubts this to any degree need only to look to his record and to his committees priorities he has always had nothing but the best interest of tribes in

concept of tribal sovereignty very seriously this bill however wellintentioned in my opinion violates and erodes the sovereignty of all american indian tribes as a result tribal governments in my state and all across the country have urged me to oppose this legislation and most tribal organizations as the gentleman from michigan has pointed out also oppose the legislation our constitution recognizes three types of sovereign entities beyond our own country first foreign governments second the states and third indian tribes existing law requires that to enter into gaming activities tribes must negotiate agreements with the federal government and the state government under this bill for the first time in united states history indian tribes would be required to negotiate directly with local governments in order to engage in lawful activity that diminishes the power of tribes and raises local governments to the level of sovereign entities this is wrong for two reasons first local governments are not sovereign units they are the creation of state governments and it is the responsibility of state governments to look after their interests second it is the responsibility of state governments to negotiate for and represent the interests of local governments in their dealings with tribes to shift this burden from the states to the tribes is both wrong and irresponsible as currently written the indian gaming regulatory act works it has provided tribes the opportunity to recapitalize diversify their economies and raise their voices in national politics it reinforces the tribes constitutional right to negotiate as a sovereign entity with the federal government and with state governments and it protects the interest of local governments by ensuring they work with their state governor and legislature in the state compacting process all things considered i see no upside in subjecting tribes to local governments therefore i see it as congress responsibility to continue

reporting to the department of homeland security illegal aliens when they are discovered through the normal course of law enforcement practice section 642 a of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 makes it illegal for local and state governments to adopt such laws these laws known as sanctuary policies prevent open communication between local and federal law enforcement and pose a great risk to all american citizens we cannot risk letting a dangerous criminal walk out of the sanctuaried city and possibly into our community instead by being deported as the law dictates across the nation there are repeated examples of illegal aliens who on multiple occasions have been apprehended by local governments only to be released to commit other crimes id 1430 the washington times has reported that in a december rape of a woman in new york four of the five men charged in the case were illegal immigrants and three had prior convictions that in keeping with federal law would have allowed their deportation unfortunately because the new york city sanctuary policy which prevented city police from sharing information with federal immigration authorities these criminals were released by local law enforcement authorities rather than deported had new york not enacted a sanctuary policy this rape may never have happened why take a chance on letting another rapist or potential terrorist walk out of a sanctuary city police station and possibly into your community instead of being deported sanctuary policies allow local governments to effectively set up their own patchwork of individual immigration sanctuaries this directly usurps the authority granted to the federal government under the constitution to establish our nations immigration policies some may argue that this amendment would coerce state and local police officers to step into the role of federal immigration agents this is a false argument the campbell amendment would not

funds we are providing in the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment in security both in the region and on american soil however congress has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and transparently and i know my colleagues take that responsibility seriously we have included financial reporting requirements for all funds in the foreign operations chapter for afghanistan countemarcotics and west bank gaza programs we have included additional auditing requirements as chairman i pledge to continue vigorous oversight of these programs the greatest weight all of us must bear is the knowledge that decisions we male as members of congress directly puts the lives of americans at risk already men and women from probably every district represented today have made the ultimate sacrifice in iraq and afghanistan i firmly believe the bill before us today will help to build stability and freedom in afghanistan the middle east and parts of asia again i urge my colleagues to vote yes on passage of the fiscal year 2005 emergency supplemental conference report on h r 1268"], [0.21084338426589966, 0.28915661573410034, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise again today to offer this amendment to cut the level of funding in this appropriation bill by approximately 1 percent this would equal 570 million as you well know i have offered this amendment on a number of bills this year and in prior years and i understand the difficulty that the appropriators have with narrowing down the requests from members and from the administration and although this committee has done an excellent job on this and i understand also that the committee will oppose me and beat me into submission i will whimper and go away but i still think the point needs to be made that we need to begin to really draw the line and the projected deficit is simply too large we could do something about the deficit now this will not solve it by any means if we did 1 percent i mean we are talking one cent on the dollar and that will not solve it but it would tell the american public that at least we are concerned about the deficit and we are willing to do something significant in that direction i have no doubt that some of the good programs in this bill would take a cut and that is unfortunate but the budget should be no different from the taxpayers budgets at home when you have less money you spend less money it is really as simple as that although we all know it is not really simple it is a difficult thing to do i would ask for

article in usa today that the fbis entertainment office consists of five agents they are responsible for responding to requests from hollywood for information when i was elected to congress one of the things that i wanted to be aware of the whole time that i was here is that we have a responsibility to spend taxpayers dollars wisely i do not think that the united states taxpayers should be subsidizing hollywood in any way i wanted to express to the chairman of the committee with my gratitude for his good work and to others interested in this issue that i hope that these agencies can be more fiscally responsible with these taxpayers dollars and i do not think that we ought to be subsidizing hollywood in any way when theywant information that was what i wanted to make very clear today the sum total of that amount is 250 000 each year that goes for hollywood liaisons i wanted to respectfully make the gentleman aware of this i move to strike the last word we will look into this we were led to believe by the fbi that they do not have this the gentlewoman may be right we will look into it and work with her to see that this does not take place"], [0.22985410690307617,

and give the airlines the ability the time and the means by which they may treat their employees better by holding onto their current pension plans whether they freeze them or they take some other action in conjunction with their employees so that their employees will not be thrown for the loss that the united employees saw when that company decided that it would use the pbgc the pension benefit guaranty corporation just as a convenient tool to discharge in bankruptcy those employees pension plans that devastated those employees the united erffployees and devastated their families why are we doing this on this legislation because it is very interesting through the course of this legislation during the consideration in the committee and on the floor we could never quite get a vote on airlines now we are going into a conference committee and the republicans say oh everything is going to be just fine and yet we know that already this conference commfttee is starting to attract attention that this may be a vehicle for other measures that are unable to move in this congress and so we do not know what is going to be in play so we wanted to make sure that the members of the house have the opportunity to say that these airlines ought to be able to try and work this out the other factor is that time is rungoing to have to declare and make a decision relatively soon we do not know if this conference is going to be committed so it is just a question for the members do you or do you not want to be able to be on record to suggest that this would be better treatment for these employees hopefully for these companies than what happened under the united pension plan you saw what mr pomeroy said many many business executives people involved in the pension business have looked at this bill and they have said that this bill is going to make it more difficult make it more costly and probably lead to additional terminations the pension benefit guaranty corporation the people that handle this problem when all else fails told us this is worse than current law now you can ride that animal if you want but you may also if you are deeply concerned about the airline employees in your area you may also want to vote for this motion to instruct so we send a clear message to the house conferees and the committee have refused to have this vote at any stage of the process that we be allowed to have a vote and that we support the effort of having the airlines be able to work this provision out that is what this motion to instruct does it is important it is important to the airlines it is important to the employees it is important to their families it is important to how we look at solving this difficult problem of holding onto peoples retirement nest eggs and to the pension plans that they are currently in this is presented as some great pension reform it really does little or nothing to forestall the trend that we now see developing in terms of the termination of pension plans and people losing their retirement nest eggs i would urge the house to support the motion to instruct"], [0.24347412586212158, 0.2565258741378784, 0, "i rise in strong support of the managers amendment to h r 5835 the veterans identity and credit security act of 2006 over the past 5 months data security incidents at the department of veterans affairs state

a number of other amendments which we have had which is recognizing the fact that when you are dealing with head start you are dealing with a population that comes from 100 percent of poverty or less and you are dealing with people who are going to have barriers in terms of their education they may be barriers in terms of where they live or the ability of the parents to care for them they may be homeless or foster children as the sponsor has pointed out and i think it is only right and just and absolutely the correct thing to do to increase that access in fact perhaps that is more important than anything else we can do in terms of the kinds of children we are reaching out to in terms of their background issues so for that reason i am extremely supportive of this amendment and i think it
