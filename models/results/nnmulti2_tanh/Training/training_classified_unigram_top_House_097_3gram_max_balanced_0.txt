genuine respect for than the gentleman from georgia who in my judgment is a man of impeccable integrity i fully support the efforts of the committee on public works and transportation to inquire into the manner in which superfund legislation is being carried out and i recognize that access to the development of documents is critical to the success of such oversight efforts further i yield to no one in my efforts to enforce the clean water laws and in particular to the controlling of our toxic substances and my desire to uphold the prerogatives of the house of representatives therefore it is a matter of considerable regret and disappointment to me that a conflict with the administration over access to files had been allowed to deteriorate into confrontation reflected in this proposal to cite the epa administrator for contempt of congress i have believed throughout and continue to believe that this dispute can and should be resolved through negotiation leading to committee access to the documents in question and therefore accomplishing far more quickly what the contempt citation presumably is supposed to achieve when one considers the full range of potential court action that could be involved in this matter to date it has not been possible to develop in as important a matter as a citation for criminal contempt the same sort of strong bipartisan consensus that normally characterizes the work of the committee on public works and transportation that consensus over the years has not been achieved easily and i am very disappointed over the fact that we have not been able to achieve this but the principal issue i think and the concern of the administration is the question of precedent i do not believe the administration is desirous of depriving the congress of access to legitimate requests for information to carry out its investigation i do not believe that they are desirous of holding back on environmental enforcement information what i do believe is that they are concerned about some of the enforcement sensitive information and even more importantly concerned over the precedent that could actually cause problems in enforcement in other areas going beyond the environmental protection issue i am talking about areas of drug traffic and i am talking about organized crime as well as some of the sec matters the contempt power of congress is an extraordinary power and should not be used unless all other avenues have been exhausted the committees action i think fails to recognize that epa agreed to turn over to the committee a substantial amount of information including some sensitive documents it would have been far more appropriate had the committee accepted the documents analyzed them and then used the knowledge thus derived to argue for any additional documents indicated indeed the committee in my view would have been in a much stronger position had it done so as the gentleman from colorado"], [0.00013244152069091797,

construction to field a variety of new weapons systems to modernize our armed forces provide important staging facilities in the persian gulfindian ocean region so the rapid deployment force can defend our interests there improve unitedstates readiness in europe and the pacific area and upgrade some of the poor living and working conditions of our military personnel at home and abroad as you can see this is not just a simple brick and mortar bill with it the army will be able to build 47 projects totaling 132 million so it can base the patriot and roland air defense missile systems in europe place the multiplelaunch rocket system with our troops in germany and the united states and introduce the combat electronic warfare intelligence cewi system in germany this new generation of weapons is the result of extensive research and development begun during the early 1970s to insure that the army will be a modern fighting force in the 1980s for the navy there are projects totaling 24 5 million to continue the development of a west coast trident submarine base at bangor wash and 69 6 million for the start of a new east coast trident base at kings bay ga with the authority in this bill the air force will be able to develop two groundlaunched cruise missile glcm bases in europe as part of natos upgrading of tactical nuclear forces there is 69 1 million in the bill for this purpose also there is 102 3 million for facilities to house and maintain the airlaunched cruise missiles alcm being placed at four unitedstates b52 bomber bases and 19 million for the bed down in europe of the new tr1 allweather reconnaissance aircraft which will provide battlefield surveillance to theater and tactical commanders in nato perhaps the most controversial weapon system supported in this bill is the mx missile the administration requested 366 million to start construction of a horizontal multiple protective structure mps basing mode even though it is evaluating alternative methods for basing the system this creates an awkward situation in which the congress is being asked to authorize a basing mode that the administration may want to change after completing its review and the president makes a final selection in july as presented to the comihttee the mps plan would house 200 missiles in 4 600 horizontal shelters clustered on mostly federally owned lands in utah and nevada the committee approved 356 6 million for the mps basing mode deferring for 1 year 9 5 million requested for land acquisition purposes because of the present uncertainty over how the mx system will be finally based the committee felt it should allow the president the flexibility to change the basing mode and at the same time insure that any alter native approach selected by him must be approved by the congress in this way the proper checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches on this issue are preserved by section 305 in the bill that section states that no funds authorized for mx basing in this bill may be obligated for an mx basing mode other than mps unless first the president determines and certifies to the congress that it is in the national interest of the united states to develop a basing mode for the mx missile system other than a multiple protective structure basing mode and second the congress before the end of the 60day period beginning on the date of the receipt of such certification adopts a concurrent resolution stating in substance that it approves the development of the alternative basing mode selected by the president it should be made clear to all that this in no way is an attempt to force the mps system on the new administration it merely means that if the president does select this basing system the funds are available for him to proceed and no time is lost on the other hand if an alternative is chosen and the congress approves of it these same funds can be used for the new basing modeand again important time is saved we should remember that congress has directed that the mx missile system must be operational by the end of 1986 when our present icbm arsenal will be most vulnerable to the soviet unions new generation of longrange ballistic missiles regarding another important matter i want to state that this bill authorizes 424 6 million to build staging facilities at access bases in the mideast and southwest asia for the rapid deployment force the committee did defer 49 5 million in projects at lajes fields in the azores and 26 million for airfield development at ras banas egypt these actions were taken because negotiations have not been concluted with portugal on the azores program and a decision has not been made on the final air force mission requirements in egypt the deferral of these two projects should not be interpreted as a lack of support for the rdf when all the related details for these projects are finalized i am confident they will be approved by the committee this bill also carries slightly more than a billion dollars in new construction to improve the readiness of unitedstates and allied forces in europe this is one of the largest amounts ever requested for construction in europe in recent years and demonstrates our commitment to nato it also says the united states is willing to take the first bite on financing a longrange plan to restation certain unitedstates army units within west germany so they will be more effectively deployed against the warsaw pact threat for this purpose the army requested 18 million to initiate the restationing plan and our committee approved it but we also feel strongly that the west german government should be a full partner in this redeployment effort and thus help bear the cost which could run into hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade governmenttogovernment discusslons on this question are in progress and hopefully a bilateral agreement can be reached before next years budget submission this restationing plan also will greatly improve the working and living conditions of the american soldier in germany gen frederick j kroesen commander in chief of the 200 000 troops in the unitedstates army in europe has told many of us that these conditions must improve if the morale of his troops are to remain high it is easy to agree with general kroesen once you see some of the unitedstates bases in west germany let me quote from an eyewitness account from a chicago tribune reporter who recently toured some of the american bases in west germany in hanan stores are housed in peeling whitewashed huts that used to be german cavalry stables in the small bavarian town of kattebach one company has 6 showers for 57 men and 2 women three are in a latrine with mildew all over the walls and ceiling its been that way for a year when the shocked soldiers ii12677 juine 4 1981 arrived from the clean comfort of ft lewis washington it will be at least this summer before improvements are made in the bavarian base town of schwabach and at scores of the 700 unitedstates bases in europe the motor pool is a sea of mud for most of the year that just makes it more difficult and more unpleasant to maintain the armored vehicles trucks and tanksoften 20 years oldsupposed to take soldiers to war if youre single and live in the barracks you may be crammed in with five even seven others home for many gis is a 6by6foot section of a room in a barracks built for adolf hitlers nazis or even kaiser wilhelms troops and barely renovated since this bill provides funds to help correct some of these quality of life problems facing our service personnel a matter that should be of great concern to all of us while the military construction program this year is one of the largest in recent years i believe it more genuinely reflects the needs of the department of defense than has been the case in recent years due to a series of contributing factors the department of defense physical plant is in an accelerating state of decline often impairing our defense capability much of it is of world war ii vintage which means that many facilities still in use are obsolete and have far exceeded their planned economic life this condition coupled with inconsistent funding support during the past several years has produced a large facilities backlog in both construction and maintenance as a result it has precluded optimum training created lower morale and has severely inhibited reenlistment efforts this situation must be turned around i believe this bill will help do that therefore i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation which meets the military services needs and at the same time is fiscally responsible in that the total amount authorized is well within the administrations budget request i yield back the balaince of my time"], [0.00015375018119812012, 0.4998462498188019, 0, "i and sufficient quantity of stainless steel move to strike the
