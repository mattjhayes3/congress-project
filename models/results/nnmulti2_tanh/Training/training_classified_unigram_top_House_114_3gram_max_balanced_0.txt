vast majority of our constituents want us to do something about preventing more gun violence in this country mass shootings have become unacceptably commonplace in the united states of america and we have a responsibility to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands the shooting in orlando was the largest mass shooting in our countrys history this is a moment of truth and we cannot have another moment of silence without some action we are pleading with the speaker of the house and we are pleading with our republican colleagues to allow us to bring two bipartisan bills to the floor for consideration so that we can debate them and vote on them one is the no fly no buy legislation if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane because you are on the terrorist watch list according to the fbi then you are too dangerous to buy a gun it shouldnt be controversial the second is to eliminate the loopholes in our background check system which says that you have to go through a background check if you go to a licensed gun dealer but that you can get around that by going to a gun show or by buying a gun online overwhelming numbers of democrats and republicans according to the latest public opinion polls think both of these ideas are smart commonsense approaches the only thing that is standing in the way is the republican leadership in this house please schedule these bills for a vote no we will not be satisfied with the nra bill that you want to bring to the floor this week that basically is nothing but a press release but will not keep guns out of the hands of people who are suspected of being terrorists i hope that we can reach some sort of accomodation with our republican friends we are not going away this issue is too important and it is about time we acted silence and indifference can no longer be tolerated in this chamber if we defeat the previous question i will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up no fly no buy it is bipartisan legislation that will give the attorney general the authority to bar the sale of firearms and explosives to those who are on the fbis terrorist watch list i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the

much more to be done dr martin luther king expressed this a half century ago when he said of all of the forms of inequality injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane i couldnt agree more and it has been the work of the cbc and of the congressional black health braintrust which i chair to advance the critical phrase of the human rights and civil rights struggle health equity this year the cbcs health braintrust will focus on three core principles strengthening our communities improving health access and marching toward a healthier future the disparities facing minority

made funding decisions that have benefited only a few at the expense of the middle class and minorities the great recession and subsequent years of budget cuts have only made things worse for these communities while the republicans budget demonstrates their commitment to maintaining this inequality the budget put forth by the congressional black caucus today attempts to rebuild and restore what we lost especially in the housing sector which is why it has my support first the cbc budget retains a robust consumer financial protection bureau which congress created to protect all americans from predatory loans that led to millions of foreclosures many of which were in the african american community the cbc budget also makes critical investments in affordable housing programs including fully funding public housing and fully restoring section 8 housing choice vouchers lost due to sequestration the cbc budget would also invest muchneeded resources to add over 20 000 new beds for the homeless across our country investments in these important rental and homeless assistance programs is especially important given the fact that we have nearly 8 million households in america for whom

observations on race and justice in america our attention to the divides in our society however does not end because we entered a new month we must remain focused on how we can bridge the divides in our society and how we can bring our nation closer together the divides are striking and we know them all too well the school to prison pipeline education disparities health disparities the injustices in our justice system it is well established in fact that students of color face harsher punishments in schools than their white peers leading to a higher number of youth of color in detention suspension and yes expelled african american students are arrested far more often than their white classmates black and hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in schoolrelated arrests or referrals to law enforcement currently african americans make up twofifths and hispanics onefifth of confined youth today disparities are found not only in how we punish behavior in schools but also how we fund education this is true in k12 it is also true in higher education and we know that a college degree is a path to a middle class life as african american students graduate with more debt than their white classmates the cuts to pell grants are threatening african american access to a better education without the pell grant program hundreds of thousands of young african americans would not be able to afford college the disparities in access to health coverage are startling the infant mortality rate among african americans is 2 3 times that of nonhispanic whites and african american infants are four times more likely than nonhispanic white infants to die mostly due to complications related to birth weight we must confront these prejudices and these injustices in our nation headon the congressional black caucus is committed to resolving these challenges the congressional black caucus has fought to ensure funding the pell grant pell

like a sea of red as deltas marched in and lined up one after another wearing our colors crimson and cream deltas lined the outside of the hearing room we did that because prior to entering that room media and some of my colleagues on the other side had tried to make it a bad thing that she organized and was a founder of her college chapter of delta sigma theta sorority what we were able to do was to show them when we work together whether that is democrats and republicans or sorority members or nonsorority members when it is the right thing to do we can make a difference i was so proud last

before the senate judiciary committee for nearly 8 hours and she responded to nearly 900 written questions which is unprecedented many of the written questions were from senators who had already declared their opposition to her nomination ms lynchs nomination has now been pending far longer than any recent attorney generals nomination which in my opinion is shameful she deserves to be voted

the fetus would be forced to give birth the bill also treats doctors as criminals for providing care that has been the law of the land for 42 years and it puts doctors safety at risk by requiring

liberals would pass when given free rein and a blank check with doddfrank democrats deemed it necessary to punish small community banks with burdensome regulations they cannot afford to comply with doddfrank created a new unaccountable bureaucracy called the cfpb which is funded in a way that obscures its transparency and prevents congress direct oversight of the agency the lack of accountability like that seen with the cfpb and the heavy hand of agencies like the epa and the irs have become hallmarks of this administration with the stimulus bill democrats gave handouts to their union and socalled green energy friends taxpayers were on the hook for loan guarantees to companies like solyndra which used its political connections in the white house to push through irresponsible loan approvals when solyndra went bankrupt it was at the cost of the american people many other smaller boondoggles came out of the stimulus silly studies on ducks over 1 million on road signs that promote the stimulus and over 3 million for a tunnel for turtles in florida this leaves obamacare too many americans have felt the negative consequences of what boils down to a government takeover of the healthcare industry the president claimed this law would decrease premiums by 2 500 per year instead they have risen since obamacare has been enacted to go with the increase in cost many americans have seen a sharp decrease in their choices there are fewer plans available restricting the ability of hardworking families to choose coverage that is appropriate for their circumstances taken together this trio of liberal policies is adding layers of bureaucratic red tape forcing americans to pay more for health care and putting taxpayers on the hook in 2009 democrats used the blank check to add 1 5 trillion in discretionary spending when republicans gained control of the house of representatives in 2011 we put discretionary spending on a downward trend discretionary spending funds our federal agencies such as the epa and the irs as well as the department of defense we have made real cuts in spending not slowdowns in growth and not projected cuts down the roadhonesttogod cuts in spending since i took office in 2011 discretionary spending has been cut significantly by 434 billion but this does not address mandatory spending which is the real driver of our national debt this includes programs like food assistance welfare medicare medicaid social security and interest on our debt reforms are needed to ensure these programs work efficiently and are sustainable because of the way obamacare was written and enacted mandatory spending also includes large portions of obamacare funding mandatory spending is on autopilot and will continue with or without congress annual appropriations process the fact is we have to change the law that means both chambers of congress have to pass reforms and the president has to sign them or we have to override a veto mandatory spending accounts for threequarters of all money spent by the federal government this is a 180degree change from when i was a teenager when in 1970 mandatory spending was only about a third of government spending realistically there is only one path to a balanced budget and shrinking our national debt that path is to pass a budget and use a process called reconciliation a budget facilitates reconciliation which only requires a 51vote majority in the united states senate and avoids a filibuster by liberals who want to continue running up americas credit card not doing a budget forfeits the opportunity to do reconciliation reconciliation with mandatory spending program reforms coupled with real tax and regulatory reforms will send a strong signal to our entrepreneurs and businesses

important for these critical discussions we are trying in many ways under your leadership to really tell the truth and let the entire country know exactly what the economic status is what the job opportunities and educational opportunities are in the african american community and how those disparities continue to grow and really how we need to really do everything we can here to begin to close those gaps and disparities so thank you very much once again we stand here tonight to discuss economic opportunityof course i have to say the lack of opportunity in the black community in recent months we have seen communities across this countryincluding baltimore and my hometown of oakland california in my congressional districtdemand an end to the systemic and institutional racial biases that plague our society people especially young people are calling for an end to centuries of oppression they are fighting for equality of opportunity the opportunity for every american to live the american dream too many places in our nation are tales of two cities one city is bright shiny and new it is home to new condominiums and fancy restaurants the other city is left with boarded up stores abandoned homes and too many people without a job and without hope i know congresswoman kelly congressman payne congressman jeffries myself all of us represent these cities these two cities within one context one environment one framework one boundary we all know that the inequality of opportunity really is not a new phenomenon we have lived with these structural injustices for centuries but it wasnt until the race riots erupted in watts chicago and detroit in 1968 that our government began to take some notice after the riots president johnson convened the kerner commission to investigate the root causes of the unrest the kerner report clearly showed a nation moving towards two societies one black one whiteseparate and unequal while the kerner report identified the problem our nation failed to truly address it there still is not liberty and justice for all the kerner report also called for better training for police new investments in jobs and in housing and the end of de facto segregation now this report really could have been written last month sadly nearly 50 years later we still live in a country where the color of your skin and the zip code in which you were born determines your future but i am proud to be working with members of the congressional black caucus to continue to address these persistent inequalities in our nation by working on policies and programs to create economic growth educational opportunities and job opportunities for example we know that black children are disadvantaged from day one more than one in three black children are born in poverty that is one in three in the worlds richest and most powerful nation a third of all african american children are forced to grow up with the harsh reality of poverty day in and day out this is outrageous it is unacceptable the cycle of poverty continues in the school systems that institutionalize this discrimination while black students represent just 18 percent of preschool enrollment they account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions can you believe that preschool student expulsionsthat is really a disgrace we are talking about kids ages 2 to 5 years old these kids dont even get a start let alone a head start what in the world are children that young doing being expelled from preschool then in high school the graduation rate for black students is 16 points lower than the rate for their white peers black students are far less likely than their white counterparts to obtain a 4year college degree and the crisis and inequality extends from education to the economy itself over the past four decades the unemployment rate for blacks has remained nearly double the rate for whites today the unemployment rate in the black community stands at 10 1 percent that is reported now to put that into context the current african american unemployment rate is higher than the national average was at the height of the great recession in addition to higher unemployment rates african americans are also nearly completely locked out of some key economic sectors especially the tech sector only 1 in 14 technical workers in silicon valley is african american or latino that is 1 in 14 that is why the cbc has launched the tech 2020 initiative to work with the tech sector to increase workforce diversity and investments in stem education and to expand market opportunities for businesses to ensure that the jobs of today and tomorrow are open to all for african americans in the workforce our nations inequalities are also evident in their paychecks congressman payne just laid out the statistics for women while women earn 77 cents on the dollar that a man earns it is just 64 cents for african american women the median income for blacks is a mere 34 000 that is nearly 24 000 less than the median income for whites most black families hold their wealth in home equity so the great recession hit the black community particularly hard too many families lost everything and many more black families are struggling as home prices fail to keep pace with the stock market of course the net worth now of african american families is now 6 cents to the dollar for white families the time for action is now these communities our communities cannot wait any longer we must come together like never before to address the inequalities in our nation that leave black families behind in my role as cochair of the cbcs task force on poverty and the economy and chair of the democratic whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity we are working very hard to give black families a fair shot we are talking about all families not leaving any family behind i am proud to be working with more than 100 of my colleagues to advance policies that build pathways out of poverty into the middle class for everyone for all americans yes black lives like all lives do count we have introduced the half in ten act to develop a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade this bill would lift more than 22 million americans out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by doubling down and coordinating proven antipoverty programs the congressional black caucus also took a stand on poverty in its alternative budget proposal we called for robust investments in education infrastructure and affordable housing programs that would ensure opportunities for all we must keep up this fight until congress makes these long overdue investments we need to strengthen the social safety net and invest in proven antipoverty programs such as the earned income tax credit and the supplemental nutritional assistance program these were initiatives begun 50 years ago under president lyndon johnsons great society program and they are working we also need to raise the minimum wage and fight for a living wage that is why we are cosponsors and we are very proud to be cosponsors of h r 122 the original living wage act sponsored by congressman al green which starts by raising the minimum wage for federal workers and building up to a living wage and congressman bobby scotts raise the wage act h r 2150 would increase the minimum wage to 12 by 2020 thirtyfive million americans would benefit from this also we wrote a letter signed by 72 colleagues urging the president to adopt a fair chance hiring policy at the federal level for individuals who have been previously incarcerated a fair chance hiring policy would level the playing field and help stop the cycle of recidivism that is plaguing our communities this is simply the right thing to do the federal government should not put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake and having paid their dues to society finally i am saying tonight and i think all of us are saying that we need to give families the opportunity to build wealth and live the american dream we can end poverty not just in the african american community but in the entire united states as a whole so we have got to keep calling for action as dr king said in his two americas speech that he gave on april 14 1968 at stanford university 1968 he said we must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability it comes through the tireless efforts and persistent work of dedicated individuals we must be those dedicated individuals working for the social progress that is so desperately needed when you look at the analysis of the economy job opportunities and educational opportunities in the african american community we must win this fight because the gaps and the disparities are too great only then will america be strong because we have to remember that we are a country where everyone is equal under the law in fact when you have communities with such horrible statistics as we are laying out tonight such horrible economic and educational gaps our country is not as strong as it could be and so we are

matriarch of our nations civil rights movement ms boynton robinson fought courageously to ensure that every american citizen had the right to vote her drive to secure universal voting rights was amazing and certainly she risked her life when she crossed the edmund pettus bridge in her words her son said civil rights was her entire life we now understand that congressman lou stokes made an amazing and impactful statement legislatively and throughout his life he was a consummate public servant a trailblazer who broke down barriers for generations of african americans he was the first african american congressman from ohio who served 30 years representing a portion of cleveland he prioritized the advancement of our nations most vulnerable populations he advocated for more funding of education housing development projects access to health care he was one of the fiercest advocates for public housing mr stokes was a major proponent and leader that asked the housing and urban development to assess the poor deleterious horrible conditions that children were living in as housing impacted their health in fact just recently i presented my housing authority a lead poisoning grant which was instigated was encouraged was advocated for by congressman lou stokes he has saved thousands upon thousands of lives i thank him for organizing the congressional black caucus health

secure retirement house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again for every increase in the minimum wage it has been accompanied by an expanding economy house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio indicate that the gross domestic product will grow 1 5 trillion over 10 years this is a sorry track record of economic forecasting and therefore this budget is one that i have to oppose because it favors the wealthy over working class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose the republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social

and metropolitan planning organizations offer the highest return for taxpayers and commuters through increased transparency and improved accountability americans of all types are suspicious of government right now in the context of transportation funding many americans believe that highway and bridge project decisions are based on politics and insider connections rather than statewide and regional transportation goals in many areas of the country local commuters have little idea how state departments of transportation and mpos make their project decisions or why they choose one project over another yet every year lawmakers ask taxpayers to spend more and more of their hardearned dollars on infrastructure projects with minimal transparency and accountability this amendment requires state and regional transportation plans to include project descriptions and to score projects based on criteria developed by the state or the region not the federal government requiring that projects be assessed with objective criteria ensures that limited transportation resources are invested in projects that provide the highest return on investment to commuters furthermore requiring transportation decisionmakers to communicate how projects are chosen enhances the publics understanding of and confidence in the project selection process many states and mpos are incorporating
