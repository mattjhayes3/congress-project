take a few minutes to talk about the future last december when faced with the prospect that tax rates for the richest 2 percent of americans would rise to where they were in the 1990s when we balanced the budget and enjoyed unprecedented prosperity republicans decided that extending these unnecessary and unaffordable tax cuts was their number one priority as we all remember they held muchneeded relief to the middle class hostage and they got their tax cut for millionaires and billionaires according to the joint committee on taxation this tax is adding 39 billion to the deficit this year and will add even more next year speaker boehner has said that our national debt is a moral issue and i agree with him we need to act to curb our exploding deficits and mounting debt but republicans and democrats have different approaches to the problem the republicans approach is the irresponsible continuing resolution that was passed by this house 10 days ago republicans would cut 600 million from the cops program and 256 million from the state and local law enforcement assistance program which would make our streets less safe republicans would cut 75 million from the legal services corporation which would deny legal services to the victims of domestic violence republicans would cut 53 million from the food safety and inspection service which would threaten public health republicans would completely eliminate family planning funding which would result in more unplanned pregnancies and more abortions adding insult to injury republicans would cut 758 million from women infants and children which would deny these mothers and children the nutrition they need to begin life on the right track republicans would cut pell grants by 15 percent which would deny young people the opportunity to get a college education i could go on but i think you get my point the cuts in the republican continuing resolution are shortsighted counterproductive and the wrong way to cut the deficit and the one community or the communities that will suffer the most are minority communities in this country and that includes the black communities black students black mothers and black infants as well mark zandi the former economic adviser to the mccain campaign said that these cuts will destroy 700 000 jobs and stall our economic recovery which would lessen future revenues and further exacerbate the debt problem and a goldman sachs economist warned that the republican plan could reduce our nations economic growth by 1 5 to 2 percent in the second and third quarters of this year maybe i should amend my previous statement the cuts in the republican cr are shortsighted counterproductive and may not even cut the deficit we need a smarter approach we need an approach of shared sacrifice not sacrifice by the most vulnerable we do need to cut the deficit but there are different ways to cut the deficit and i believe the republicans have chosen the wrong way democrats offer a better approach we can cut the deficit by at least 61 billion in such a manner that helps doesnt hurt struggling americans our economy and our shared future first as i mentioned before we need to get rid of once and for all the tax cuts for the richest 2 percent of americans it is too late to save the 39 billion that we wasted this year but we could save more than that next year next i think we need to get rid of special tax preferences for oil and gas companies many of which were instituted by republicans the last time they were in the majority this would save 44 billion over the next 10 years there is no good reason to keep these subsidies in place the oil companies have said themselves that they dont need them john hofmeister the former ceo of shell oil said on february 11 in the face of sustained high oil prices it was not an issuefor large companiesof needing the subsidies to entice us into looking for and producing more oil next defense secretary gates has called for 78 billion in defense cuts over the next 5 years saying that these funds can be cut without putting national security at risk we should listen to him i want to thank my friend from the virgin islands

such an important time for this discussion i also thank you congresswoman christensen for your visionary and bold leadership as you continue to make history truly you have done remarkable work here in this body it is really especially poignant that this year during black history month the republican leadership has proposed a budget for fiscal year 2011 that will fall most heavily on the backs of the most vulnerable in our society african americans latinos and the poor those who have been shut out of the american dream at a time when we should be remembering and uplifting the accomplishments and contributions of african americans to the history culture civil rights and economy of america we are literally during this month debating steps that will severely undercut and undermine that legacy can we cut nearly 750 million from the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program while we have a record high unemployment rate throughout our country but especially among african americans we cant do that the unemployment rate among african americans is over 15 percent many african american women rely on wic while they seek jobs which we are trying to hopefully create how can we cut 317 million in funding for vital family planning health services provided through a network of clinics throughout the country that serves nearly one in five women these programs are vital not just in saving lives through cancer screening hiv and std testing and contraceptive services but for providing a link for the many poor and lowincome women in terms of their link to the public health system many of these women are african american women and how can we cut nearly 1 1 billion from the head start program which will effectively knock out 200 000 children from participating in this critical early education program which helps provide health nutritional and support services to prepare children for school many african americans who were part of the head start program are now making history in our country because of this great early childhood education program the other side has made it clear that no matter who is impacted by these cutswomen infants children the working poor people of color african americanstheir response consists of only three words so be it so be it if 800 000 jobs are lost so be it if people are put out on the street with no access to homeless assistance grants or temporary housing so be it if people dont get enough nutritional support or if kids have to go hungry so be it that is not what the civil rights movement was about we should be working together to build up a nation instead of tear down the very programs and institutions that have contributed to our nations growth and success we should be working together to reduce inequality help the unemployed and get our economy moving again above all we should be working to create jobs thats what so many prominent african american leaders have fought for over the yearsfrom those who are well known the world over like dr martin luther king jr to people who are sometimes well known just in their own neighborhood tonight there is one person i want to mention who influenced my life and the direction i took our late beloved former congresswoman shirley anita chisholm in 1968 congresswoman shirley chisholm was the first african american woman elected to congress and she was a founding member of the congressional black caucus we celebrate this year 40 years of this great institution in our congress the conscience of the congress it is the 42nd anniversary of the election of congresswoman chisholm who represented her brooklynbased congressional district with grace and distinction for 14 years earning a reputation as one of the houses most eloquent orators and greatest champions of human rights social and economic justice in 1972 congresswoman chisholm again made history when she became the first african american to run for the presidential nomination of a major party that campaign captured the imagination of millions and inspired countless individuals to engage in the political process for the first time and i know for a fact that congresswoman shirley chisholm paved the way for our great president obama to be able to win the presidency 2 years ago congresswoman chisholm was a catalyst for change giving voice to the overlooked and underrepresented members of our society people of color women children and the african american community and she fought for the unemployed she fought for those who wanted to work for those who were seeking the american dream i cant help but wonder what she would say right now if she knew this was taking place im sure she does know this is taking place and i can feel her telling us that we have to fight the good fight because her legacy is so important within the context of creating jobs that we are trying to do for our country later this week i will be introducing two pieces of legislation to honor the work of congresswoman shirley chisholm the first would recognize and celebrate the 42nd anniversary of her election to congress and the second would call on the postal service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring the life and accomplishments of congresswoman chisholm i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support these bills as we work to finalize funding for the 2011 fiscal year let us remember that budgets are moral documents and as congresswoman chisholm said when morality comes up against profit it is seldom that profit loses so we have to stand up for morality reverend jim wallis and sojourners challenged us they asked us what would jesus cut programs to help the poor or wasteful weapons systems at the pentagon ending the war in afghanistan or programs to feed and shelter the poor this weekend once again i will be participating in the faith and politics civil rights pilgrimage we are going to selma montgomery and birmingham alabama the epicenter of the civil rights movement we will be led by our hero a warrior a great civil rights leader our colleague congressman john lewis who sacrificed so much for civil and human rights and economic justice i have participated in this pilgrimage many times and i always feel a sense of gratitude to congressman lewis and to rosa parks and to dr king to shirley chisholm to all of those who fought so hard for equality and jobs and freedom this year however i feel that many of these gains mind you that all of our great civil rights leaders fought for are about to be eroded due to the increasing income inequality and the reckless budget cuts which will gut so much in the way of our countrys response to the civil rights movement so as republicans fight us so hard to enact budget cuts that will destroy nearly 800 000 jobs be assured that in honoring the legacy of our great black leaders we will fight back thank you"], [0.0002759099006652832, 0.9997240900993347, 1, "first let me just say i am shocked and appalled at the comment yesterday by the speaker when he said so be it in response to the likely job losses that will occur as a result of this continuing resolution an independent analysis by the nonpartisan economic policy institute indicates that this bill will result in the direct loss mind you of 800 000 private and public sector jobs instead of doing everything we can do to halt the loss of jobs and put people back to work this bill takes the wrong approach putting our economy and our country back on the path to recession for every job opening in this country we have 4 7 unemployed people who are looking for work why would we want to add to their numbers so be it cannot and should not be our response to this economic crisis not with a 9 percent unemployment rate and over 15 percent in communities of color and record layoffs and furloughs at the state level and especially not when republicans have the temerity to demand tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires paid for through borrowed money this is just wrong and its immoral as a member of the house appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services and education i am in strong opposition to these cruel cuts budgets are moral documents and they are a reflection of who we are and what we value this spending bill makes it clear that the poor the young women the elderly teachers firefighters cops and the communities that they protect and serve are not valued make no mistake this bill will harm the most vulnerable among us and it represents a wrongheaded approach to reducing the deficit or expanding job growth in our country i am especially concerned about the proposed cuts to education and training programs among the range of cuts include workforce investment act programs which last year helped over 8 4 million job seekers find jobs they got additional education and job training support this is being cut all told when counting rescissions of prior funding elimination of the requested fy11 funding and the advanced funding needed to run these employment and training programs they will experience nearly a 5 billion cut republican cuts in job training will only prolong the recession keep unemployment high and keep more americans collecting unemployment instead of training and getting ready for our 21st century job opportunities how can we justify cutting job training programs in the middle of an economic crisis how will my republican colleagues respond to the unemployed in their communities who come to them and ask them for help will they just say so be it pell grants pell grants provide vital funds for students who wish to attend 2 and 4year colleges but who need help to pay their expenses in my district alone there are 16 institutions that provide pell grants to over 18 000 recipients this proposal would cut pell grants by 845 making college less affordable and accessible for lowand moderateincome students more than 8 million students benefit from pell grants and many would be hurt by this cut especially as schools are raising tuition fees to meet rising costs and to deal with tighter budgets the bill also entirely eliminates federal funding for supplemental educational opportunity grants which colleges and universities use to assist undergraduates who have the greatest financial need that program assisted 1 3 million college students last year head start under this proposal is cut by nearly 1 1 billion this will effectively knock out 200 000 children mind you in republican and democratic districts from participating in this critical early education program this helps provide health nutrition and supportive services to prepare our children for school the job corps program this program is cut by 891 million which will result in 21 384 jobs lost in communities in every state the majority of which are in the private sector there will be 1 7 billion lost in economic activity as a result of this and 36 000 atrisk young people will be turned away from job corps costing the government and the economy as much as 17 billion over the course of their lifetimes additionally the cuts will guarantee the closure mind you of 75 job corps centers across the nation in your districts and in our districts slashing one of the most effective accountable and marketdriven solutions for millions of youth who leave our schools unprepared is really the wrong move at the wrong time the majority has stated that they want to cut the deficit but in effect they are cutting the social safety net lifeline for those who need it the most this cr leads us down a path that will result in hopelessness joblessness and desperation and it destroys the future for our young people i urge my colleagues to meet the

its just common sense that you dont pay down a deficit our children didnt create by compromising their health our constituents deserve a balanced approach to deficit reduction the republicans approach

concerns over the congressional republicans irresponsible fiscal scheme that will harm communities and students back home that i represent we need a multiyear strategy to cut the debt and the deficit but a strategy that ensures that america retains its superiority in education innovation and research we must cut waste and close the huge tax loopholes written by lobbyists like the ones for oil companies but congressional republicans do not do this instead of tackling the debt and deficit in a smart and strategic way the congressional republicans scheme will result in job losses and it will make economic recovery more difficult for american families and businesses and here are some stark examples from the community i represent back in florida in the tampa bay area first on education and the pell grant i represent an education community with a large public research university a private college and many community colleges when the republicans propose cutting the pell grant and support to students this harms our ability to maintain our superiority in education when we are competing with countries all across the globe you know over 9 million students and families rely on the pell grant every year in america and we have worked very hard through the economic recovery to help those students maintain that same level of pell grants so dont take us backwards you shouldnt be taking us backwards do you know what its like for a hardworking family to pay tuition right now is tuition going down is tuition being cut are books being cut no so lets not turn our backs on our students and families at this time the same thing for head start in tampa and hillsborough counties we have an awardwinning head start initiative and the evidence that head start gives students a boost in life is very well known parents have to be involved we wish all eligible kids could get that boost even now before the congressional republican cuts we have 2 400 families on the waiting list and 1 000 infants and toddlers on the early start list the republican cuts again take us backwards i hear from back home that 452 families will be told that there is no room for their child they will also lay off 123 teachers just in my home county alone because in the state of florida they predict that they will have to lay off almost 2 000 teachers under your cuts schools and students the republicans again are off base in cutting my local schools particularly the title i schools that serve kids that need a little extra attention we estimate that republicans will be eliminating 20 to 30 jobs in my home district that serve students that need that achievement gap boost you are harming the high poverty middle and high school students also in the county across the bay that recently was able to expand beyond elementary school madam chairman rather than close the tax loophole for the oil companies that are making multibillion dollar profits the republicans instead cut my local police and sheriffs departments like the help we get under cops for the antimethamphetamine initiative and for our juvenile justice initiative to try to prevent gangs from forming in the counties the youth initiatives have received national awards from the attorney general and it would be a real shame if we had to turn these back also in my home county we rely on some very robust ports in the tampa bay area as our economic engine you are going to cut that support for that economic engine to dredge the canals and ports so the ships can come in and we rely on those for jobs you also are going to cut the national oceanic and atmospheric administration now after the gulf of mexico suffered the economic hit under the bp oil blowout our coastal communities were hurt badly the tourism industry the seafood industry and our wildlife habitat suffered significant damage so coming from florida when you all say that you are going to turn your backs on our ability to monitor our oceans that is very harmful because clean oceans and clean beaches mean a healthy economy certainly closing the oil company tax loophole would be a wiser course of action we all know how harsh it has been under the great

state grants without the state grants that wont be possible all im saying with my amendment is to let us see what the gao says would happen if the federal government comes in and runs these exchanges rather than the states i dont think it is going to be a good thing by comparison but i would like the gao to certainly study it i would point out 49 states the district of columbia and four territories have gotten beyond the ideology and have applied for these exchange grants there is almost nobody on either side of the aisle that doesnt have their state applying for these grants because the states know that if they are going to set up these exchanges they might as well have the money so they can have the flexibility to do it the right way so all you are doing by repealing these grants is pulling the rug out from the states your own state in almost every case whether you are a democrat or a republican i dont want to repeat what mr deal said now the governor of georgia but my colleague from texas often mentions the governor of utah and i just wanted to read a quote from the governor of utah"], [0.00472685694694519, 0.4952731430530548, 0, "i am truly honored to have had a chance to serve in congress with my colleague and friend representative jerry costello beloved by his constituents congressman costello has been a staple in southern illinois for many years for me personally he has been a model a mentor and an example of how to succeed in an age of hyperpartisanship congressman costello fearlessly crosses the aisle for his district last year he even championed the no taxpayer funding for abortion act ive also had the pleasure of collaborating with the congressman on two committees science space and technology and transportation and infrastructure he has been such a mentor for me on these committees during my first term in congress and has been a great ally especially on transportation issues and 2nd amendment rights congressman costello will be sorely missed both on these two committees and in the illinois delegation on behalf of my staff and the people of the 14th i thank him sincerely for his service"], [0.0047476887702941895,

instead has chosen to continue his indiscriminate killings of innocent men women and children his ruthless campaign of brutality has now shifted to northern syria where syrian security forces led by president assads brother have instilled fear in the residents many of those innocently protesting for reform and freedom have been gunned down and many more have fled their homes leaving all belongings and possessions behind with a complete ban on the entry of foreign journalists into the country it is nearly impossible to determine just how dire the circumstances are however with the thousands of syrians fleeing the violence into nearby turkey it is clear that conditions both in syria and on the turkishsyrian border are deteriorating i therefore urge president assad to allow humanitarian aid groups access into syria by refusing entry president assad has forced his own people to not only live under deplorable conditions but he has forced them to live in a constant state of fear aid groups must be allowed in to provide the vital care if the syrian regime has any compassion it will do so"]]}
