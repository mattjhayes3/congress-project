vote as speaker you only have to vote when you feel like it or to break a tieyou said that your votes were not reflective of your true feelings on national security and defense i said i am going to

the coast guard as a member of the coast guard subcommittee i am well aware of the funding difficulties the coast guard has faced in fiscal year 1988 i have supported and spoken in favor of granting

understand it says to mr gorbachev allow your citizens who are involved in divided spouse and blocked marriage cases to join their loved ones abroad two weeks ago as the distinguished ranking minority member has pointed out many of us in this body joined in celebration of the longlast reunification of keith and svetlana braun of michigan a married couple separated by the soviet government since 1984 their reunification was a testament that the power of love was far greater than an ocean and indeed far greater than the government that had separated them and just this past weekend and i do not know whether anyone on the floor knows this word spread that galina michelson separated from her husband anatoly for more than 30 years and elena kaplan separated from her husband for almost 10 years will soon be able to join their american husbands in the near future but the same surreal barriers which the kremlin used to keep svetlana and keith braun and anatoly and galina michelson apart remain in place in ten other divided spouse and blocked marriage cases these prisoners of love are yuri balovlenkov whose wife and two children live in baltimore md sergei petrov pyatras pakenas victor novikov andrei zhitkov victor faermark whose wife andrea wine is a leader in this country and throughout the world in behalf of divided spouses leonid sheiba vladislav kostin yevgeny grigorishin and tatiana alexandrovich people whose only crime has been to ask to live with their spouse as was promised by the soviet union and 34 other signatories in signing the helsinki final act in 1975 article 11 of the soviet fundamental legislation on marriage and the family statesthe soviet constitutionthat each spouse is free to select his or her place of residence and so each of the spouses that i mentioned has applied to emigrate to the united states each has been denied at least once so much for article 11 of the soviet fundamental legislation on marriage and the family the helsinki final act specifically states that in dealing with requests from couples from different participating states once married to enable them and the minor children of their marriage to transfer their permanent residence to a state in which either one is normally a resident the participating states will also apply the provisions accepted for family reunificatlon so what does it say about a government that continues to spend so much time energy and manpower denying a husband and wife the right to live together as one and what does it say about a government that allows some members of a family to emigrate and not others it says that this government is still unwilling to live up to the commitments it made in helsinki in 1975 let us hope that through passage of this resolution that within the next few months victor faermark is reunited with andrea wine let us hope that yuri balovlenkov is at long last allowed to see his youngest daughter a daughter he has never seen and let us hope that galina vileshina who only recently was allowed to visit her husband in the soviet union is finally able to be with him forever and let us hope that in the spirit of signing a new agreement between our two nations that the soviet union will also begin to live up to its previously signed international commitments we keep hearing about a new more open soviet union well living up to these commitments will show that soviet promises equal soviet actionsand it will have a profoundly positive impact on the degree of confidence between our two nations let me conclude with the challenge i offered
