{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "i rise in opposition to the republican majoritys socially and fiscally irresponsible budget resolution for fiscal year 2001 i strongly support the democratic substitute and urge members to do the same this bill is socially irresponsible because it cuts nondefense discretionary spending 114 billion below inflation over the next five years it does so in order to fund a fiscally irresponsible tax cut that could balloon to as much as 200 billion in five years and over 1 trillion in ten years this bill hurts the most needy americans whom the republican party has traditionally ignored it benefits the most wealthy as well as the republicans special interest friends lets take a close look under the majoritys bill funding for critical education training employment and social service programs is either frozen or cut producing significant reductions in current service levels only special education is spared the sledgehammer for example by fiscal year 2005 40 000 fewer children would be able to participate in head start and 164 000 fewer lowincome families would be able to receive liheap assistance in just one year 316 000 fewer lowincome students would be able to receive pell grants and 310 000 fewer lowincome women infants and children would be able to participate in the wic program the bill would also slash title i funding forcing school districts to provide services to a smaller number of lowincome students the clinton clay class size reduction initiative would be cut leaving school districts with fewer resources to hire and train new teachers afterschool and summer programs established to help improve student achievement and reduce juvenile crime would be cut back undermining vital school reform efforts clearly this budget abandons those most in need of federal support it also fails to address important national priorities such as securing social security and medicare and paying down the debt none of this is necessary the democratic substitute shows why our substitute cuts taxes but does so in a manner that targets the benefits to working families our substitute provides sufficient resources to invest in education

probably the end of october we might end the session but from what i hear today it may be close to thanksgiving before we get out of here either way it is a most regrettable session it is a tragic comedy that ought to end as soon as possible one of the most regretful parts of this session is that the republican majority that is in charge of the congress is not listening to the american people we as politicians always are accused of holding our fingers in the air to see which way the wind is blowing and shaping our actions and our policies in accordance with public opinion it is very interesting that this is a year when in very important areas we are not listening to the people when we should be i am not saying that we should always follow public opinion i think a representative government means that they expect some judgment to be exercised by those who are elected and sometimes their conscience and their knowledge and their vision may conflict with the opinion of the masses but in general we should always be listening and when there is a conflict we should certainly try to work towards some kind of compromise some kind of merging of our own opinions with those of the majority we pay a lot of money for polls and both parties and individuals rely heavily on focus groups and all kinds of devices to find out what people are thinking but we have a situation now where it is quite clear on several major issues exactly where people are where the majority is and this republican majority refuses to listen of course i am told that if the republican majority wants to shipwreck that first session of the 106th congress or maybe the next session too and we come to a situation where their conflict with the majority of americans is so great until the democratic process will gointo action and it will throw them out of office we should not worry as democrats we should be happy that there is such confusion and such daytoday trivializing of the processes of the congress everyday we have stupid bills that really do not mean very much and are a waste of time in our committees instead of meeting issues head on we are dancing around them and camouflaging the real intent of the majority on these bills currently we have a situation of that kind in the committee on education and the workforce as we seek to reauthorize the title i portion of the elementary and secondary education assistance act i am sure many other committees are finding the same tactics where we do not address reality we trivialize the process by playing around the edges and we are proud of not doing anything this is a nocommitment congress some people have often used the joke that when congress is out of session the republicans say it is good for us not to be around because we only do harm when we are here well i think that worse than doing harm is to not address the issues at hand and to do nothing sins of omission are the sins of the 106th congress it is a shipwreck congress as we come closer to the close of this first year it seems that matters are growing worse each day not better we might say that maybe we had a high point last week where we did vote on the hmo patients bill of rights the patients bill of rights that would allow people to have some kind of leveraging as they deal with the health maintenance organizations well we finally came to a point where we got a vote on the floor we got a long debate and there were attempts to poison the bill with substitutes and even now there are attachments to the bill which place the hmo patients bill of rights bill in some jeopardy but at least it has been accomplished finally but what took so long when so many americans have made it quite clear that they wanted something done about reining in the hmos they wanted this patients bill of rights very badly do we always have to reach the point where 80 percent of the people are for something before we can get some action by the republican majority here in the house why must it take 80 percent before they realize that there are political dangers in not doing anything so finally they yielded and we were able to get a patients bill of rights flawed as it may be passed out of the house and it is now going into the conference process with the other body and the other body has a bill which is quite different and weaker and we must watch closely to see that the patients bill of rights the heart of the matter is not sabotaged and rendered impotent it is very important that with all of the kinds of experiences that we now have all of the anecdotes that can be told on either side both republicans and democrats if one is a congressperson one is constantly being assailed with stories of the hmos and our failure to do anything to combat the abuses that hmos are guilty of so it is something that had to be done the focus groups told us the polls told us but it took us a long time to get there i am happy to see that in certain places there is movement ahead of the congress and we will have to run to catch up but i think that there issuch a strong impetus to have justice in the area of health care that we are going to get it by and by it just takes too long the democratic process should not take so long i understand that california in california today or yesterday the governor signed a bill where california now has a standard a fixed standard for nurse and patient ratios in nursing homes and hospitals we have to have a certain number of nurses in ratio to the patients that is reasonable so that the patients will get a reasonable amount of care governor gray davis democratic governor of california signed that bill i want to congratulate the people of california congratulate the legislators out there for moving forward on correcting a major abuse that hmos have caused as a pressure to bring down the cost of health care the amount of money that they pay the hospitals for health care they have forced hospitals into situations where they have cut back on personnel often personnel that is vital to the health and safety of the patients 0 2130 we should not tolerate that there are elements in the norwooddingell bill which deal with standards deal with protection access to services emergency care a number of very direct approaches which rein in abuses that are known to have been practiced by the health maintenance organizations most important in the norwooddingell bill is the provision for the suing of hmos we can take an ijmo to court and sue which nobody is recommending a large number of court suits but if the power to sue is there then it establishes a whole different environment that patients operate in and it is very important to keep that provision in there so we can applaud that finally after begging after pleading after pushing after the public opinion polls kept rising we were able to get some action on the floor we have a bill that is going through a process now which has to be watched closely but i hope it is progressing the fact that the house and senate now have to go into conference and come out with a bill that both houses can live with and the president will sign is a good sign we are much further along than we were i assure the members before we passed that bill last thursday prescription drug benefits are not dealt with in this bill this is to deal with reining in hmos there are some items in there related to prescriptions and how hmos must handle prescriptions there are some efforts to cut abuses by health maintenance organizations in the case of prescriptions but we have not addressed the issue of providing prescription drug benefits for people who are on medicare there is a need to be able to let every american share the benefits of modern science there is a need to be able to make certain that no person goes sick or is in pain unnecessarily if we have the drugs if we have the medication which can ease pain can improve health then the factthat a person has no money should not be a barrier to the use of those modern miracle drugs i think that there are some situations where various ailments or diseases are quite rare and unusual and the production of the drugs and medications necessary to treat them is very costly they deserve special treatment but there are a large number of drugs which are designed to deal with commonplace ailments diabetes is an ailment which afflicts millions of americans there are medications for diabetes which everybody should be able to have access to some of them are a bit expensive and expensive is a relative term if a widow is on a small pension and social security and has to pay her rent and food et cetera what is expensive to that widow might seem rather inexpensive to some others of us who are healthy and still working and have good salaries but why should the person who needs it most and the people who are most frail who are the eldest people the people who have declining incomes in many cases or no incomes do without in too many instances i have had people tell me i could not keep taking my medication i could not maintain the drugs that i needed because i just did not have the money it was a matter of either i eat or i take my medications and i had to stay alive some of those same people we do not find them around after a few months because the drugs they take are vital to their health or they become much sicker as a result of not being able to take drugs that are beneficial to the prevention or the retardation of certain kinds of advancing ailments so they get very stck they go the hospitals and they are charity cases they must be taken care of in a much more expensive setting than would be the case if they were allowed to have prescription drugs i am on several prescription drug bills i am happy to say that we have colleagues who have proposed remedies and the president has certainly proposed an initiative that will begin to deal with the problem of the denial of prescription drugs to persons who are in need of these drugs i am on a bill that the gentleman from massachusetts has to require the secretary of health and human services to submit to congress a plan to include as a benefit under the medicare program coverage of outpatient prescription drugs and to provide funding for that benefit i am on another bill that the gentleman from new york has which is a bill to amend title 18 of the social security act to provide for the coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under part b of the medicare program the gentleman from maryland has a bill i am certainly on a bill with our colleague the gentleman from washington in his bill of course he covers all prescription drugs because that is a singlepayer bill h r 1200 i just want to take this opportunity to say that h r 1200 the singlepayer bill sponsored by the gentleman from washington is still very much alive as a piece of legislation we continue to reintroduce it i am on that bill i am on a bill with the gentleman from rhode island with the gentleman from vermont a bill to require persons who undertake federallyfunded research in developmental drugs to enter into reasonable pricing agreements with the secretary of health and human services and for other purposes some might have seen some of these exposes that have appeared on television in the last few months of what the drug situation is with respect to the united states as a principal creator and manufacturer of modern drugs we have a situation where we are charging our citizens far more for those drugs that are created in this country than citizens of other countries are being charged we do not have to go all the way to europe just go next door to canada or next door to mexico and we will see tremendous price differences between the drugs important prescription drugs that are being sold in canada and in mexico versus the price we pay here many of these same drugs have been developed as a result of basic biology and chemistry research that has been done in american universities financed by the taxpayers of the country and have been done in our institutes of health there are studies and all kinds of things we do to enhance the production of important modern drugs but we are as citizens forced to pay enormous prices far more than people in other countries this is unacceptable this is a reason to get angry we cannot dawdle here in the congress and let this continue to go on we need to come to grips with the fact that our people our citizens who in many cases have financed partially financed the development of important modern drugs are being charged enormously excessive rates for the use of those drugs that is more unfinished business the public says they want something done about this the polls say we need to do something about it the people have spoken but nobody is listening the republican majority is not listening to the american people some folks in new york state for example have made a joke out of the fact that the first lady hillary clinton is considering running exploring a possible run for the senate she has announced for several months now that she is on a listening tour she is not running she is on a listening tour they made fun of that and thought it was very funny that it is a new twist and people like to play with it but i think it is a very good idea to have every american elected official start out by listening it is a very important part of our activity we pay a lot to get to the point where people are talking to us through our polling through our focus groups it is a vital part of the operation no political campaign goes forward without polls and without attempting to measure the opinion of the public so we know that they want prescription drug benefits we know they want a bill of rights for health maintenance organization patients we know this very well so why is the republican majority refusing to listen to the american people we have some areas where the public has no opinion or no particular concern where there is a great deal of activity here in washington to spend their money to spend the taxpayers money the other side likes to talk about taxpayers money being wasted on food stamps and wic programs and medicare and programs that benefit people but they are very much involved in the effort to revive the f22 the f22 is an airplane that may be a miracle airplane it may be able to do all the things one day when they get through with the research and testing the f22 may be a miracle airplane able to do wonders but it costs billions of dollars to manufacture f22s they are trying to work out a situation where they can get it through the testing stage and we will build 50 to 60 billion worth 6f f22s why do we need 50 to 60 billion worth of f22 fighter planes when we have very good planes that are far superior to any planes manufactured anywhere in the world why do we need another super super fighter plane but there is a great deal of discussion underway about what can be done to save the f22 how can we develop a rationale to spend billions of dollars to develop this plane that is manufactured mostly in marietta georgia the home district of our former speaker of the house of representatives mr gingrich what can we do to revive the f22 the public is not asking for the f22 in no poll no focus groups will we hear people crying for more f22s i marvel at the way the majority the republican majority gets stuck and stays in one rut i was looking through my records and found that on march 14 of 1995 that is 4 years ago more than 4 years ago i commented on the f22 and the folly of pursuing money for the f22 at a time when the republican majority was proposing to save money by cutting back on school lunches i think about a month later in april i talked about the nation needs your lunch where the republican majority was saying to schoolkids we have a budget crunch we need your lunch we have to cut back on school lunches in order to make certain that we balance the budget that same republican majority was at that time very much pushing the f22 i am going to go back and read from march 14 1995 what i said i would like to make one more plea for justice i want to again beg the leadership of this congress to abandon its reckless demolition of the programs that have helped to make america great in the eyes of the whole civilized world the way we as a nation have treated the least among us is the vital ingredient of our greatness this is a plea for honest decisionmaking yes there is waste in government and it must be removed but school lunches and summer youth employment programs are not wasteful these are the government programs that work these are the programs that are still very much needed the cia is not needed at the level of 28 billion a year which they admtitted was at least that much in 1995 the farm price supports for rich farmers are no longer needed at the level of 16 billion a year we do not need another sea wolf submarine and we certainly do not need to spend billions of dollars for f22 fighter planes the f22 enterprise in marietta georgia represents a longterm overwhelming pork barrel for this same amount of money we could double the number of jobs in the civilian sector creating infrastructure and services that are needed the f22 is republican pork in the federal budget this is a huge hog that deserves to be slaughtered my point is that the f22 in 1995 was on no list of public opinion at a high level demanding that we build f22s in 1999 it is even less desirable than it was in 1995 yet we are going ahead not listening we are not listening to the public when they say they want a patients bill of rights we are not listening to the public when they say we want prescription drug benefits we are not listening to the public when they say we want school construction an increase in the minimum wage they are not listening but they are trying hard to put together a program to maintain the f22 in 1999 in 1995 i did a little poem for them that went as follows the f22 for pork not for me and you the f22 toys for skies blue empty of any enemy crew the f22 jobs for just a few the f22 rich georgia stew pork pork pork not for me and you off the orphans starve the kids gave the contracts roll out the bids bully the poor be a hightech dog eat the best meat high on the hog for the peach who gives a hoot the f22 pork is now the georgia state fruit pork pork pork where they grow the f22 that is the speakers hometown too the f22 pork pork pork not for me and you 0 2i45 the f22 mostly manufactured in marietta georgia the home of former speaker newt gingrich and there are still people who are working day and night to put together a plan to keep that f22 flowing at the cost of billions of dollars nowhere is the public asking for more f22s we are spending a great deal and amount of time to do the things that nobody wants done except a small special interest few but we are ignoring some other big issues while we dawdle here in this 106th congress and do not pay attention to anything of great importance the era of prosperity and relative peace in the world which has given us time to focus on important vital matters is being whittled away we should be dealing with the fact that in this era of peace we should invest more funds in ways to keep peace going not in f22s and other war machines that are really outdated where is the next contact likely to come from probably between india and pakistan every day some new development takes place way over there between two very highly populated countries that have been at each other for quite awhile mainly over the issue of kashmir the pakistani government was overthrown today there was a coup the elected government elected by a majority of the people was overthrown by the army pakistan has had a long history of military rule and whenever the military rules they only go backward they have a lot of economic problems at this point and they are likely to get worse why is the pakistani army in charge now because the elected prime minister a person chosen by the people decided to dismiss the chief of staff of the army the chief of the armed forces the chief of the armed forces is the person rumored to have caused a major up heaval a few months ago when he marched without the knowledge of his government without the knowledge of the prime minister of the approval of the elected officials that went into kashmir beyond the line of demarcation and caused a crisis with india that blunder is the kind of blunder that could lead to a situation where we would inevitably be drawn in not that we could do much to solve the problem in that place it is not so easy to have a bombing campaign which would bring whoever is right and wrong and it is not clear who is right and who is wrong to the table in that situation there may be two recent nuclear powers i will not say amateur nuclear powers but they certainly are recent there is a recent acquisition recent testing of nuclear bombs if they start throwing bombs at each other then the atmosphere is polluted the winds are blowing who anywhere in the world is going to be safe from the kind of radiation fallout who anywhere in the world will be safe from the kinds of things that would permanently be done to the environment as a result of some kind of even a smallscale nuclear war between pakistan and india so we ought to be studying ways to deal with making peace in the world and pakistan india and kashmir ought to be one of those places that we are focusing attention on we have focused very little of our energy and attention on that region if the same kind of energy and attention that we focus on the middle east was focused on that area we might have gotten close to a solution by now not that we have done too much in the middle east we just need to do as much to deal with the worlds second most populous nation india and a very densely populated nation of pakistan there is a territory called kashmir and it lies between india and pakistan and years ago when i was still in school india promised that it would allow selfdetermination for the people of kashmir that has been on the agenda for all of these years and still no plebiscite no vote has been allowed under the supervision of the united nations or some kind of outside objective observers which would allow the people of kashmir to make a determination as to what they want to do whether they want to become part of india or part of pakistan or become independent i h9888 india says no the focus of the world is on the gunhappy army of pakistan yes that is a problem pakistan must find a way to control its own military on the other hand the situation is exacerbated by the fact that india over these years has refused to allow a plebiscite where the people can vote their own destiny we applauded we were very happy when finally east timor was allowed to vote and overwhelmingly the people of east timor voted to be independent as a result of that of course they paid a heavy price because in a very few days the armed forces disguised as guerrillas and local militia exacted a heavy toll in terms of lives and property but it went forward troops from australia are there now and people who like to put down military interventions and say they are never good i think the people of east timor a very small nation of less than 500 000 people welcomed the entry of the australian and other troops under the united nations command to help bring some justice there well we hope we never have to send troops to kashmir and i doubt if it will be so easy to do that why are we not working on some peaceful solutions to that problem right now why are we not working on peaceful solutions to the problems in a large number of places in the world why do we not spend some money on our peace academy we have a peace academy most people have never heard of it there is an organization with a very tiny budget that does things in the name of promoting peace our peace academy really ought to be as large as our military academies if we are serious we have west point we have the naval academy we have the air force academy we have the coast guard academy we have the war college we have numerous places where we are still training some of our best minds for war for old fashioned war violent war but we have no places where the federal government is investing significant amounts of money to train people for peace so i mention this because the folks who are here pressuring to find billions of dollars for the f22 are off course they are certainly not listening to the american people i think if it went to the american people common sense would set a different agenda they would say what is being done to promote peace how are we investing to promote peace and that would go forward we are not listening though we are not listening to those who want to see justice in the world with the least costly means and that is through a process of peaceful negotiations in kosovo there are some people who have said that it would not have gotten as bad as it was if we had given the peace process the nonviolent approach more resources and they are probably right but that is a matter of hindsight now there are a lot of situations in the world where as a matter of foresight we ought to be investing more heavily in peace but we are not listening the republican majority is not listening to the american people they are not listening on the hmo bill of rights they were not listening they are not listening on prescription drug benefits they are not listening on the minimum wage bill we have a minimum wage bill now which members of the house of representatives have signed a discharge petition for because under normal circumstances we could not get the bill to the floor now that large numbers of members have signed and we also know that a considerable number of members of the majority of the republican party are willing to vote for a minimum wage bill finally we hear rumors that there is going to be some movement on a bill which would merely raise merely raise wages from 5 15 an hour to 6 15 an hour in a twoyear period fifty cents a year over a 2year period considering the fact that we have unprecedented prosperity in this nation our ceos corporate heads are making salaries higher than ever before some of their salaries dwarf the budgets of small countries we are in a situation where the majority the republican majority will not listen to the american people who say it is only fair only fair that we increase the minimum wage so that the people on the very bottom are able to begin to make their work count for more people who are making minimum wage a family of four who lives in poverty they are still below the poverty line at this point if they are making a minimum wage let us raise it over a twoyear period by one dollar republicans have a counterproposal the leadership of the majority of the republican party has not committed themselves but there are proposals to raise it 25 cents per year over 4 years the unprecedented prosperity that we enjoy now is not enough to make them sympathetic toward a 50 cent increase per year but it appears that finally they are going to listen to the point of yielding to a minimum wage bill being placed on the floor if they can exact a high price for business there may be some compromise coming i think it is important it is important to people in my district new york is one of the states with large numbers of people who are still making only the minimum wage and we need to help those people who are working get better rewards for their work the welfare reform bill is coming to a point now where the limits are going to be kicking in and more people are going to be thrown off welfare certainly some mothers of young children and they need to have jobs out there that at least pay 6 15 an hour instead of 5 15 an hour the republicans are not listening but i think we have reached the 80 percent point at least 80 percent of the american people are saying we think that it is only fair that there be an increase in the minimum wage what the republicans are proposing in the area of programs that help the people on the bottom the most are across the board cuts at this point we have the appropriations process which is creeping forward i said this this first year of the 106th congress is a tragic comedy it is tragic that certain vital things are not getting done it is a comedy to see the kinds of proposals that keep popping up that they expect us to take seriously even the republican candidate for president has stated that he does not want to be identified with certain proposals that have been made recently one proposal to cut off the lump sum payment of the wage extension that people get as a result of having worked and not making enough money they now want to cut that into 12 parts and pay it out on a monthly basis instead of the earned income tax credit being paid in a lump sum at one time i think the reaction of the republican candidate for president was he does not want to be any part of an action which attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the poor i applaud his candor and i applaud his truthfulness but that only led to another absurd and very harmful proposal by the republican majority now they are proposing across the board cuts let us cut everything drastically the health and human services bill which contains most of the programs that benefit the poorest people in america that was being targeted as the last bill to come out of appropriations where the highest amounts of cuts will be made now they are getting a little more generous and saying we are not going to just make them bear the brunt of the burden we will have it across the board and all the appropriations bill will be cut and let everybody suffer at a point in history where we have the greatest prosperity this nation has ever known we want to go to the american people and say we are going to cut title i we are going to cut head start we are going to cut food stamps we are going to cut aid to college students the pell grants and student work programs we are going to cut we are going to cut and say with a straight face that we are being responsible this is responsible because we need the money in order to put it into a pot for a tax cut a tax cut for people who are working and earning sizable amounts of money most of the tax cuts the greatest benefit of the tax cuts would go to the richest people in america that is responsible that is listening to the american people the fact that the polls show that most people have used their common sense and said look this tax cut does not make sense the people who need it most are not getting it the people who need it least are getting the most why do we need this kind of tax cut i am in favor of a tax cut i am in favor of a tax cut but we ought to start at the bottom and cut the payroll taxes on the poorest people in america the biggest increases in taxes over the last decade has been in the payroll taxes social security and the taxes of medicare the taxes that have been imposed on everybody and poor people have paid the biggest increases so let us start there and cut the payroll tax first and then come up and cut the people at the lowest income levels first and keep going so we can give the middle class which probably suffer the most because they have enough money to really place them in jeopardy in terms of unfair taxation but not enough to be able to benefit from all the loopholes and the corporate giveaways so they suffer the most the middle class needs some relief but that is not the way the republican majority proposes to handle the tax cut after they have across the board cuts their tax cut will not give the money to the majority of the people in america in any kind of significant way so they are not listening they are not listening eighty percent of the people say this tax cut proposal is no good but they are not listening when it comes to education and school construction that is a high priority the american people keep demanding it i have been on the floor time and time again saying that the people want more federal assistance for education they want more government involvement at every level whether we are talking about the state government or the city government or the federal government they want more government my people in my district need help they are tired of situations where the children have to eat lunch at 10 00 in the morning because the school is so overcrowded and most of the schools in my district there are twice as many students as the school was built for so it is overcrowded from the time they come in in the morning to the time they leave and the lunchroom cycle has to be arranged so that the lunchroom is not overloaded at any one time that means that some schools have to have three and four lunch periods if they have to have three and four lunch periods in order to get the kids in there safely and out then they have to start having lunch in somecases at 10 00 in the morning that is child abuse to make a child eat lunch at 10 00 in the morning is child abuse but it is going on in large numbers of schools because they see no way out in the same schools there are some students being taught in the hallways some being taught in closets there are situations where the presidents proposed bill to give money for more teachers at the lower grades cannot help us because of the fact that if they get more teachers they do not have a way to reduce the classroom size because there are no classes in a first grade class one teacher cannot be put in one corner of the room and another teacher in the other corner of the room and expect to have any productive teaching taking place it will not happen so as we get more teachers in order to reduce the size of the classes they need more classrooms it goes on and on and the public says look we are tired of it we want more done about education and we want specifically to have something done about school construction school infrastructure school repair school wiring things related to the physical infrastructure i have been saying this for some time so i guess my credibility in this house would not be that great because one might say i am prejudiced i am locked into a position let us look at the polls that all of us politicians respect the abc news washington post poll released on september 5 1999 says the following support for education over tax cuts we find that improving education and the schools will be very important to 79 percent of americans when choosing the president next year more than any other issue more than any other issue only 44 percent say cutting taxes is very important making it 14th out of 15 issues do my colleagues want to know what the 15 issues are the top five issues according to the abc news washington post poll released on september 5 1999 is one improving education 79 percent rank education as the number one issue handling the economy 74 percent managing the budget 74 percent handling crime 71 percent protecting social security 68 percent now the fact that any one of these made the top five is such that i would not quibble about which is most important first place or third place or fifth place those are top five education is always in the top five for the last 5 years sometimes it trades places with social security and sometimes with crime education has always been there in this poll 79 percent say improving education is the top issue what are the lower five of these 15 they are still important issues helping the middle class 61 percent handling gun control 56 percent still over the majority feel that handling gun control is important handling foreign affairs 54 percent still over a majority over the 50 percent cutting taxes below the 50 percent only 44 percent are interested in cutting taxes campaign finance reform 30 percent i am sorry to see that campaign finance reform is down there so low but to make the top 15 is important considering this nation has more than 250 million people and all the opinions of different problems and issues to make the top 15 is important campaign finance reform is one of the those issues where i think we elected officials members of congress and others have to move public opinion we have to explain to the people we have to use our own set of principles and our own values to help guide public opinion into realization of how dangerous it is not to have campaign finance reform and to have money play such a great role in our democracy let me just go a little further on this education issue when we take the education issue and break it down into parts the polls show that 80 percent of americans support at least three education priorities what are those three priorities fixing rundown schools ninetytwo percent favor fixing rundown schools 92 percent only 7 percent opposed and 1 percent says they do not know let me just say that again fixing rundown schools 92 percent favor and only 7 percent oppose are we listening is the republican majority listening is the democrat minority listening are our democratic leaders listening is the white house listening we do not have in this congress adequate proposals to address the fact that 92 percent of our people say fixing rundown schools is a top priority eightysix percent say that reducing class sizes is a top priority 86 percent favor 13 percent oppose 1 percent says they do not know but reducing class sizes 86 percent favor and 13 percent oppose placing more computers in the classroom 81 percent favor 16 percent oppose 2 percent do not know a lot of people will say well that is a luxury computers in the classroom hookup with the internet all this stuff we need pencils and papers we need chalk we have got to stay with the basics well i think the common sense of the american people have run off and left members of congress who think that computers educational technology hookups with the internet all that is not vital to the education of children in 1999 who are going to be in a cybercivilization tomorrow they are going to have to take jobs in a world where if one cannot use computers and use them effectively there is very little hope for one ever having the opportunity to make a decent living so placing more computers in the classroom is of vital importance the common sense of the american people has sensed this instincts have told them that this is important we are privy to all kinds of studies we know as members of congress that we are considering another bill to bring in people from outside the country who would fill the jobs and information technology because we have so many vacancies there is so much pressure from industry here in this country to get more people from the outside to take these jobs we know that most people out there do not know that but their instincts tell them their observations at a very low level without all the benefits of the staff and the studies that we have say that computers in the classroom are important in other words 80 percent of americans support at least three education priorities fixing rundown schools reducing class sizes placing more computers in the classroom i think i have just begun to tell my colleagues that the three are inseparable if we do not fix rundown schools if we do not create more space if we do not allow funding for schools to be able to wire for the internet and in many cases the wiring in the walls will not take and they have to be rewired in many cases they have asbestos problems and that has to be taken care of as a construction issue so fixing rundown schools is vital in order to be able to put more computers in the classroom fixing rundown schools of course is obviously vital if we are going to reduce class sizes in the places where the children have the greatest amount of problems with reading and where we want to reduce class size in order to be able to give the early teachers the elementary grades a chance to be able to help kids more to learn to read to establish the basic fundamentals that allow them to be successful in school in those places they have the worst physical plants the worst infrastructures they do not have any classes they need more classes before they can have reductions in class sizes we are not talking in new york city this fall about the tremendous shortage of classrooms and the overcrowding we talked about it last year and the year before now the silence is such that one thinks the problem has been solved and resolved it has not there is more overcrowding now because there is a great increase in the number of students that have gone into the schools there is more overcrowding now because children are being held back on the policy of no social promotion some children of course last year had to go to summer school and had to attend summer school in buildings that were so hot that it was torture for young kids to be in those buildings during the summer because they have no air conditioning and they have very poor ventilation then they found out some of those same kids should not have had to be there because they had passed the necessary tests and they did not need to go to summer school in order to qualify for advancement to the next grade there had been an error an error in the calculation of the test to show us how blunders place children at risk and make them suffer the private sector i think was involved in that testing blunder as well as the board of education but let us put that aside for a moment and consider the fact that there is silence in new york city a city that had 2 billion in surplus last year and did not spend a penny to help renovate repair help building those schools not a penny of that surplus went into the schools there was silence at the state level the state had a 2 billion surplus and the governor vetoed a bill which called for 500 million to help repair schools the burden should not only be on the shoulder of the federal government we need movement on the federal government because in the process of having the federal government move we hope to stimulate and drag along other levels of government in this process of getting schools built why do i think it is so important because as i said many times before in any religion the state of the temple the church or the synagogue the way the physical building looks is the beginning of the assessment of the way people feel about that religion if it is a dilapidated rundown neglected building then nobody is going to take the parishioners seriously about their religion and the way they feel about it because that symbolism that highly visible statement of how one feels is there when one does not take care of school buildings one sends a message to parents in my community and certainly in inner city communities across the country that we have abandoned the schools that is almost true the major leaders of america the people who are in the power structure have abandoned public schools in their heads already many have overtly done it others do not realize yet but the way they behave their hesitation their neglect their sins of omission means that they have abandoned public schools already because if one does not move to build and rebuild the physical infrastructure then all hope is lost parents have no hope when they hear the rhetoric of the department of education of the white house or the congress or any member of the congress they hear the rhetoric but they see the schools collapsing they see the schools have leaky roofs crumbling walls they see the schools have coal burning furnaces there are still more than 200 schools in new york city that are burning coal and jeopardizing the healthy kids immediately and causing respiratory illnesses among teachers when though see these things happening they are correct in not believing that elected officials are serious about maintaining the public school system is it any wonder then that so many inner city parents white and black and certainly a large number of black parents are opting to support vouchers more than 50 percent in certain surveys in a survey that was taken last year 57 percent of black parents in inner city communities said that they would certainly support vouchers in order to get their kids a decent education they did not have any faith left in the public school system that is most unfortunate but that is a truth i have to stand here and admit they have given up hope because they realize that their child only has one life and they only go through the process of being educated one time and they cannot afford to wait any longer they are desperate but in their desperation they are turning to a system which will also disappoint them because all we have done is create a hope in a false institution that does not exist the private sector cannot handle the millions of youngsters in public schools who need help there is a large scholarship program that was developed by some millionaires in new york and they put up large amounts of money and a thousand youngsters could be provided with a scholarship which allowed them to go to a private school of their choice the money that they got as a scholarship would pay half of it thousands and thousands are on the waiting list because there are no schools to accommodate all of those young people there are no private schools that can accommodate it it would take 20 or 30 years to build a private school system that could accommodate the 53 million children who now go to public schools in america it is not an answer to the problem and the parents who have given up hope are only going to have their hopes dashed greatly as a result of this illusion that is being created by people who wanted to destroy public schools to make a point and to prove that the private sector can do it better if they lose a generation they are so cold hearted that they do not particularly care what happens to that generation but that is about what we are facing a generation will be lost while we try to get in place a private school system to replace a public school system which now takes care of 53 million students it is most unfortunate i can only close with the same message that i have brought here before many times both parties are negligent in focusing on the principal problem with the education improvement effort kids must be provided with an opportunity to learn as we try to raise standards as we standardize curriculums we need to focus on the students themselves and provide them with the maximum opportunity to learn at the heart of the opportunity to learn is a physical facility we need a physical facility which can support the opportunity to learn they need a decent library they need decent laboratories they need a clean safe environment conducive to learning we cannot go forward unless we address the issue of school construction school repair school modernization the bills that we are supporting in the democratic caucus is a bill that i have my name on as a cosponsor is totally inadequate it is a bill to sell bonds and the federal government will pay the interest it is a commitment of the federal government over a 5year period to 3 7 billion for the school construction situation under a situation where each locality or state will have h9892 cg to vote to borrow money and we will pay the interest on the principal that is totally inadequate as would he go into a cybercivilization i strongly advise urge and plead that all elected officials understand that what would he need is an omnibus cybercivilization education program to guarantee that the brain power and the leadership needed for our present and our expanding future digitalized economy and hightech world will be there at the heart of such a comprehensive initiative we must set the allimportant revitalization of the physical infrastructure of americas schools these necessary brick and mortar creations will long endure as symbols of this particular set of leaderships commitment to education it will also serve as practical vehicles for the delivery of a kind of hightech education required in the 21st century all of the most brilliant and visionary education achievements of the clinton administration may be merged and focused through these vital and physical edifices we have had a net day movement for the volunteer wiring of schools we had the technology literacy legislation the community technology centers the distance learning projects and the widely celebrated and appreciated erate for telecommunications the lifting of standards the improvement of school curriculums and the support for smaller class sizes are also initiatives that require the additional classrooms and expanded libraries and laboratories that school modernization will bring we are not listening to the majority of americans the republican majority is not listening and too many other people in other places also are not listening we need to listen on all of these vital issues whether it is the hmo bill of rights prescription drug benefits minimum wage the need to fund hhs right across the board with increases instead of decreases or school construction all of these are areas where leadership is needed where the demands right now in a time of great prosperity and peace are that we lay the foundation for a cybercivilization and we do that with an education program that is across the board seeking to improve education but starting with the allimportant area of construction of new schools"], [1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.9999998807907104, 1, "i rise today to commend deputy

crimes against individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender deputy attorney general holder urged congress to pass legislation that would expand federal authority to prosecute those responsible for such crimes on may 3 1999 i hosted a community discussion at clark university in worcester massachusetts on this timely and important piece of legislation h r 1082 the hate crimes prevention act of 1999 the forum brought together scores of community leaders and organizations including the national conference for community and justice the human rights campaign the safe homes

james byrd junior a 49yearold black man was murdered in a brutal attack in jasper texas his alleged assailants three white men dragged him for 2 miles while he was chained to the back of a truck four months later matthew shepard an openly gay student at the university of wyoming was kidnapped robbed beaten and burned by two men on a cold october night this young man with a promising future died 6 days later recently in littleton colorado certain high school students appeared to have been specifically targeted and murdered because of their race and chosen faith in my own district the jewish community center in worcester massachusetts experienced the evils of antisemitism when nazi swastikas were painted throughout the facilities those who participated in the community meeting last week shared moving accounts on the effects of intolerance these crimes attack the very democratic foundation of our country the hate crimes prevention act would expand the situations where the department of justice can prosecute defendants for violent crimes committed because of the victims race color religion or national origin it would also authorize the department of justice to prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes against others because of the victims sexual orientation gender or disability current federal law does not cover crimes with these motives in 1997 the latest year for which fbi figures are available over 8 000 hate crime incidents were reported that is nearly one hate crime every hour clearly the time to pass the hate crimes prevention act is now over 40 states have hate crimes statutes including i am proud to say my home state of massachusetts however only 21 cover sexual orientation 22 cover gender and 21 cover disability by strengthening the federal law state and local authorities will be able to utilize federal personnel and investigative resources hate knows no boundaries we need a law to protect all americans tough federal hate crimes legislation would give our justice system the tools and authority to recognize acts of violence committed on the basis of a persons gender race ethnicity sexual orientation or religion by recognizing these incidents and punishing those responsible we can begin to eradicate these acts of hate from our schools our neighborhoods and our country dr martin luther king junior believed that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere by passing this legislation congress will send a clear and powerful message that we will not tolerate these violent acts which not only change the life of the victim but affect the entire community the ripple effect caused by these crimes sends shock waves throughout the targeted community often leaving fear despair and loneliness in its wake we all need to join together to break down the walls of ignorance and to build a community founded on tolerance justice and compassion the allies of hate are not just the perpetrators silence and complacency are allies as well the enemy of hate is a community and a congress that does not tolerate hateful messages words or deeds we must take a stand and pass the hate crimes prevention act of 1999 now not next year or

of new mexico this bill seeks to compensate uranium miner victims for their losses it also seeks to compensate the millers and transportation workers who received radiation exposure the federal government was aware of the dangers and yet it allowed thousands of men to be exposed to high levels of radiation causing death and serious injuries the congress has acted once before on this issue but we did not go far enough the bill moves us in the right direction it moves us in a just direction for more than 50 years the unitedstates government has ignored a group of its citizens who are most in need of its attention for years our government asked its citizens in arizona utah colorado and new mexicomany of whom lived on the navajo reservationto serve their country by mining milling and transporting uranium for 50 years these citizens did what was asked of them but slowly over the years they began to realize that their lives were changing more and more of them were becoming sick they were developing respiratory problems they were developing cancer although the federal government had adequate knowledge of the hazards involved in uranium mining miners were sent into inadequatly ventilated mines with little or no knowledge of the dangers they were being exposed to in 1990 congress realized that something had to be done so it passed the radiation exposure compensation act reca to compensate underground miners in several of the states where uranium mining occurred unfortunately we did not go far enough over the past 9 years we have learned much more about the effects of radiation on our health and communities we know now that exposure to radiation was not limited solely to miners but to those who milled and transported the ore we know now that exposure to uranium is responsible for more medical conditions than originally thought and we know now that the devastating effects of exposure to uranium extends far beyond the few states included in the original law it is time for us to make things right that is why today i introduce the radiation exposure compensation improvement act of 1999 this bill has bipartisan support and is cosponsored by my colleague from new mexico mr skeen the credit for this bill belongs to those activists who have dedicated their lives to correcting this injustice this is a companion bill to legislation introduced in the other body by mr bingaman of new mexico and cosponsored by the democratic leader in that body mr daschle first our legislation expands the geographic area eligible for compensation to include the navajo reservation according to a recent study by the national cancer institute navajo children in the 1950s found themselves exposed to extremely high levels of radiation during the period of heaviest fallout from the nevada test site there are several differences between this legislation and similar legislation introduced in this body during the last congress 1 we include transport workers who may have been exposed to radiation while transporting the uranium away from the mines 2 the compensation we provide for the socalled downwinders includes diseases that were not previously attributed to radiation exposure and are not included in the house bill these include salivary urinary colon brain ovarian and male breast cancer the reca improvement bill needs to keep pace with medical knowledge 3 we direct the secretary of health and human services in consultation with the secretary of energy to report on the known health effects to communities where there were uranium mines and mills a report on the status and outcomes of reclamation of uranium mines mills and mill tailings is required along with recommendations for further action 4 finally we ask the secretary of hhs to evaluate access to

students setting up classrooms in trailers hallways and closets the unitedstates department of education estimates that 6 000 new schools must be built by 2006 at a cost of billions of dollars to handle this overflow yet the republicans have chosen to cut nondefense discretionary spending like education furthermore 46 percent of todays schools lack adequate electrical wiring to support the fullscale use of technology and our schools are still suffering from a digital divide schools with 90 percent or more of minority students have less access to computers17 students per computer compared with only 10 students per computer in schools with less than 25 percent minority students yet instead of focusing on these important issues the republicans are increasing defense spending by 17 4 billion the biggest percentage increase in the dod budget 11 percent is not for what is really needed like pay raises or operations and maintenance countless numbers of our soldiers are on food stamps but the republican budget focuses more on building new weapons than helping to retain our soldiers and to improve their quality of life our longterm national security depends not just on how many bombs and missiles we build but how well we can retain our soldiers and how we can prepare our children for the highlycompetitive global economy they will face the democratic alternative focuses

voluntary prescription drug benefit for all schools through medicare and issuing reconciliation instructions to the ways and means committee to make it real providing more debt reduction than the republican budget by not spending all of the onbudget surplus the democratic alternative maintains onbudget surpluses for the next ten years unlike the republican budget thus the entire debt would be

led the fight last year to restore food stamp eligibility to the children of legal immigrant as well as elderly legal immigrants who entered the country before enactment of the 1996 welfare bill the

individual freedom and personal responsibility the republican party best reflects my values and opinions i believe the strength of our nation lies with the individual and each persons dignity freedom ability and responsibility must be honored i believe in equal rights equal justice and equal opportunity for all that every single child has a right to live in an environment where they can achieve their fullest potential i believe that free enterprise and the encouragement of individual initiative have brought prosperity opportunity and economic growth to our country i believe that the government must practice fiscal responsibility and allow individuals to keep more of the money that they earn i believe that the proper role of government is to provide for people only those functions that they cannot perform for themselves and that the best government is that which governs the least i believe the most effective responsible and responsive government is the best for the people and closest to the people i believe americans must retain the principles that have made us strong while developing new and innovative ideas to meet the challenges of a changing world i do believe that americans value and should preserve our national strength and pride while working to extend peace freedom and human rights throughout the world finally i believe that the republican party is the best vehicle for translating these ideas into positive and successful principles of government as america faces tragedies like the shootings that we have seen across the country in the last few months i remain even more convinced that a return to traditional values and personal responsibility that made this country great are absolutely essential i think president reagan said it best when he said we must reject the idea that every time a law is broken society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker it is time to restore the american precept that each individual is accountable for his actions as a

order and have a debate a debate about the mandate does not mean that stops the mandate we have the prerogative to stop it or proceed but what mr boehlert does today is take away the real meat behind this thing the hammer behind the thing the thing that makes it work and that is accountability this is about accountability we as members of the house should not have any fear to have a debate about the cost of a mandate and then have the responsibility to make a decision whether or not the mandate is worthwhile whether or not we should proceed and if it is worthy of our vote then we vote for it

bureaucratic overreaching by the secretary of the interior when it comes to trampling on the rights of states to regulate gaming activities within their borders this amendment would prohibit funds from being expended to approve class i gaming on indian lands by any means other than a tribalstate compact entered into by a state and a tribe there are four compelling reasons to vote in favor of this amendment first the united states supreme court has ruled that it is unconstitutional for the indian tribes to force the states to allow gaming within their borders by suing in federal court there is nothing in the supreme court decision that allows the secretary to take it upon himself to approve compacts where the states and tribes have not agreed in many cases the tribes are now completely bypassing negotiations with the states because they know they will receive a more favorable ruling from the secretary of interior second the national governors association and the states attorney general believe that the secretary lacks legal authority for rulemaking and that statutory modifications to igra are necessary to resolve state sovereignty immunity issues let me share with my colleagues what the national governors association stated on this issue they strongly believe that no statute or court decision provides the secretary of the united states department of the interior with authority to intervene in disputes over compacts between indian tribes and states about casino gambling on indian lands such action would constitute an attempt by the secretary to preempt states authority under existing laws and recent court decisions and would create an incentive for tribes to avoid negotiating gambling compacts with states third while not an entirely enthusiastic supporter of the national gaming study commission i do agree with its adopted language that opposes the secretary of interior empowering himself to grant class i gaming licenses to indian tribes why my colleagues say because the gambling commission after a 2year exhaustive study determined that indian gaming was poorly regulated throughout this country and out of control finally there is nothing in the indian gaming regulatory act which grants this authority to the secretary of the interior this amendment would prohibit overreaching by the secretary of the interior of the worst kind i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help reign in a bureaucracy that is so obviously out of control that it would grant gaming licenses in states and jurisdictions where both the governor and the people do not wish to sanction this activity may i say before i close i have lived in las vegas for 38 years i grew up there i know gaming i agree that the poverty on the indian reservations is horrific but if anyone thinks granting indian tribes gaming licenses is a panacea for the reservations abject poverty they are sadly mistaken certainly there must be better ways of bringing economic development to chronically poverty stricken indian reservations and of correcting a failed and disgraceful national policy when it comes to our indians giving them carte blanche
