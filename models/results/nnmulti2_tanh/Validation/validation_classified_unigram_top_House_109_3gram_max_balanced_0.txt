floor day after day to share with the members what we are doing right and what we are doing wrong so many times we focus on this side of the aisle on the plans that we have here on the democratic side of the aisle inhelping americans to continue to prosper need it be they are in small business or they wake up and go to work every day educating our children making sure that we have a healthy and prosperous and safe america before i get started i know mr ryan will be joining me momentarily i just want to share with the members a few plans that we have on this side of the aisle that we would like to implement the only thing that is stopping us from bringing these plans to the floor and implementing action well we are moving in the right direction with great force is the fact that we are not the majority here to be able to bring these issues to the floor as you know in the past i have talked about energy i encourage members to go to housedemocrats gov to pick up a copy of our energy agenda talking about alternative fuel talking about bringing about flex vehicles in the industry to be able to allow more americans to purchase vehicles that are flex vehicles that they can use e85 and gasoline real security plan it is there dealing with homeland security we have already said on this side of the aisle if we are in the majority that we would irplement all of the 9 11 recommendations to make america safer this is a bipartisan commission as the members know that was appointed and this house was part of it and they did outstanding work those recommendations have still not been fully implemented to protect america we have our initiative that we have been trying to promote for the last 3 to 4 months in a very forceful way which is allowing working americans to be able to earn more money it has been 9 years since the american people have received an increase as it relates to the minimum wage it is very very unfortunate that we have americans that are working for 5 15 an hour the minimum wage has been the same since 1997 which is now approaching 10 years as you know many americans have suffered under the low minimum wage that we have now that is throughout for individuals that are working every day and i have a few facts here of the last 50years i mean this is the lowest it has been in the last 50 years also 6 6 million americans will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage and something that i must add the republican leadership has said that they vow not to raise the minimum wage again this year or next year so i think that is something that the american people need to pay very close attention to threequarters of the minimum wage workers are adults that are over the age of 20 many of whom are responsible for over half of the familys income one day of work it takes an entire days wage for an earner to buy a tank of gas also studies have shown that zero jobs have been lost when the minimum wage has been increased eightysix percent of americans do support an increase in the minimum wage twentyone states have moved in the direction of increasing the minimum wage i do not know what is going on here with the republican majority in not moving in that direction to allow more american people to have money in their pocket to be able to provide for their families we havetalked many times on this floor in the 30something workifg group about the new weight that has been placed on the heads of the american people as they start to send their young people to college li 1730 just yesterday we had a town hall meeting downstairs in this building in hc5 here in the capitol building with some young people who are thirdparty validators with the student loans they have out now and this is very serious because now people are starting to prepare their young people to go off to college in the month of august and late july many of whom are now having to take out these student loans at a very high interest rate they are going to end up paying almost 100 more a month in interest to pay for their college and i think that is something we need to pay very close attention to it is very unfortunate that on the majority side on the republican side all due respect to all the innovation that one tries to come up with on the other side of the aisle it is costing the american people more and it is putting our young people in debt in this country even before they can grab their college degree and earn a living they are already on average somewhere around 25 000 or 30 000 in debt when they step across the stage that is very very unfortunate we cut student aid here we increase student loan rates here the states in turn have to cut and the cost of college is increased it increases on these individuals it is an increase on these individuals i think it is also important mr speaker for us to talk about the fact that we have the will and the desire on this side of the aisle to move america in the right direction i talked about this last week and i think it is very very important to bring this up here again today that we are willing to move this country in the right direction in a new direction making sure that americans have more opportunities i think it is important for us to point out the fact that on this side of the aisle we have committed again to raising the minimum wage we have committed to helping this country become energy independent investing in the midwest versus the middle east within 10 years we have also committed on this side of the aisle i mentioned it earlier to implementing all of the 9 11 recommendations but one of our major commitments on this side and also to the american people is that we have said that we are willing to bring this budget back into balance within a reasonable time not that we are going to cut the deficit in half or we are going to balance the budget but we are going to be able to bring us out of this deficit spending that the republican majority has led us into with record deficits as far as the eye can see we have the resume on our resume we have the accomplishment of being able to do that we have accomplished that before in the past and i think it is something that one needs to pay very close attention to when we say a commitment to making sure our fiscal house is in order it is not a slogan it is not something that someone says well the polls say you need to say you are going to bring spending under control we have actually attempted to do that you have seen this chart before we cant talk about it enough because the facts are in regardless of the floor speeches that may go on on the republican side of the aisle i think it is important for us to outline the fact that we have put our legislation where our mouths are we have said that we want to see this house say that if you are going to spend then spend in a way that almost every american family has to spend if you are going to buy something you have to know how you are going to pay for it you cant put everything on a credit card and what is unfortunate is that we have allowed other countries to be a part of our country financially not because the american people have made a bad decision but it is because the majority and the white house have made some bad decisions here i have a paygo rule that on this side we have adopted that we are willing to pay as we go if you are going to buy it you have to show how you are going to pay for it it is not that you spend or you buy and then you borrow john spratt who is the ranking member on the budget committee on the 2006 budget resolution and this is the congressional record this is not something the 30something working group put together this is rollcall vote 87 march 17 of 2005 republicans voted 228 against this payasyougo amendment that we put forward again mr sprat and the ranking members substitute amendment to house concurrent resolution 393 this is also rollcall vote number 91 march 25 2004 224 republicans voting against payasyougo on a rule we tried to put in place when i say try that is all we can do at this particular point because until democrats are in the majority we are not going to be able to put this country into the fiscal position it should be in once again and i do say once again i pull my chart out this is almost my exhibit a here thirdparty validator and the source that has given us this information happens to be the unitedstates department of the treasury here we show that 42 presidents over 224 years were only able to borrow from foreign nations and this is money that the united states has borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years and 42 presidents 1 01 trillion through world war i world war ii the great depression a number of other conflicts slowdowns in the economy and other issues that have faced this country 42 presidents have only borrowed 1 01 trillion in 4 years 4 years with president bush 1 05 trillion with the republican congress just in 4 years if someone came to me and said kendrick you have to throw all the charts out but one if you just wanted one chart this would be the one that i would pick because i think it reveals what has happened here in this house how it has been so easy for the republican majority to put runaway spending on a credit card and allowed foreign countries to be able to own a part of the american apple pie what is so very very unfortunate here as all of this borrowing has taken place you would think that student loans would have a lower interest rate you would think that alternative fuels would have an opportunity to be a part of the marketplace and that we would be moving towards more cleanerburning fuel you would think that we would have a worldclass health care system and that companies as big as general motors and as small as a momandpop store that has five or six employees in it would be able to provide health care for their employees and you would also think that a number of states would not be suing the federal government because of the underfunding of the leave no child behind with all of the money that has been borrowed from foreign nations but what has happened is that the superwealthy in this country have gotten the biggest tax cut inf the history of the republic what has also happened is that republicans have been allowed to spend in recordbreaking i mean just off the charts for republicans to come down here and blame democrats for spendingi mean really i know it is kind of hard for them to keep eye contact with someone like me and those of us in the 30something group who knows better who know what the facts show that 1 05 trillion has been borrowed from foreign countries they are weakening our country as they start to move and allow these other countries to be able to own so much of the american apple pie and i will close with this before i yield to ms wasserman schultz who came in before mr ryan i think it is important for us to look at it from this standpoint that if you borrow money from someone the relationship has changed i heard someone from the white house say this morning on the today show we are the last standing superpower okay well you must be talking about militarily because financially we are getting weaker every day under this administrations policy and the rubberstamping of this republican congress i think it is important that everyone understands that we have borrowed money from countries that we have never borrowed money from before in a recordbreaking way the republican majority has done so without our help but because they are in the majority that has happened and now they are looking at us under a different light we still have budgets that are being passed here on this floor that is going to even make the american people more indebted to foreign nations some that we have questions of their links to possible terrorism and other questionable measures with that i would like to yield to ms wasserman schultz"],

paying the price for this rubber stamp are the american people at the gas pump this is graduation time a lot of parents are going to see their children walk across the stage but guess what college assistance and affordable loans will not be there for those children because we are willing to give 42 000 43 000 in tax breaks to millionaires the republican congress says they gave tax cuts for the american people yes they are american people too but i am not talking about the middle class the middle class family does not consider themselves millionaires i am holding this rubber stamp because this is what got us here mr ryan talks about paying for that let us put that rubber stamp over here how we are paying for it is we are making history in all the wrong places 224 years 1 01 trillion borrowed over 224year 42 presidents combined 1 01 trillion the republican congress and president bush he could not do it without the republican congress has been able to borrow 1 05 trillion over just

to take the country down the track it has gone down and the bottom line is that a republican majority from the leadership on down to the newly elected member of the republican conference has to take credit for giving the president the kind of power that he has right now we are fighting wars abroad for democracy when here at home we dont celebrate that very democracy that so many people speak of we have individuals that are on their third and fourth deployment i am on the armed services committee so i get the reports i get the letters from my constituents saying my husband my wife my mother my dad my niece my uncle my nextdoor neighboris on his way back to iraq again abec se we went alone we didnt go with a true coalition so i think it would be hard if i was a part of the republican majority to try to muster up some talking points for the floor right now to be able to say well okay some of this stuff is not believable so lets try to attack some members of the democratic caucus lets try to muster up and embellisha record on possibly being weak on terrorism or being weak on national security thats where the republican majority is now they are gasping for political air right now but you know what is so important about this issue and this discussion about national security is that it is supposed to be nonpolitical and unfortunately it is and that is because the majority hasnt allowed bipartisanship in this house for so many years and so they can hang it around their neck and say it is our war it is our failure as it relates to national security and border security dont act like it is a crisis right now you allowed it to happen under your watch you have been the rubber stamp congress now mr ryan and ms wasserman schultz let me just tell you what the rubber stamp congress has accomplished borrowing 1 05 trillion from foreign nations in 4 years in more than 224 years of this countrys history with 42 presidents 1 01 trillion they were able to borrow in 4 years and this republican congress and the president has allowed that to happen these are the countries here that own a part of the american apple pie japan china the u k the caribbean taiwan germany and opec nations you know this whole oil thing that we will talk about in a minute korea and canada they all have their hands in the pockets of the unitedstates taxpayers not because of the unitedstates taxpayers but because of the republican majoritys outofcontrol spending oil companies oh wow at this time in history when they unearth what happened under this republican majority and this presidency they will see these record breaking profits there was a meeting in the white house i have the article to prove it and i talk about it all time it was a special meeting that took place in the white house and the vice presidents aides and all met and then the policymakers came here to the congress to the rubber stamp congress now let me set this up here because we believe in the 30something working group in thirdparty validators washington post wednesday november 16 2005 white house document shows that executives from big oil companies met with vice president cheneys energy task force in 2001 something long expected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by the white house last week industry officials testified before congress document obtained by the post on november 2005 shows that officials from exxon mobil phillips shell oil companies and bp of america met in the white house complex with cheney aides to develop a national energy policy parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated in congress that was 2001 look what happened 2002 34 billion recordbreaking profits 2003 53 billion 2004 84 billion 2005 113 billion in profits for oil companies meanwhile average americans are spending through the nose and trying to make it to work and to drop their kids off look what happened here this is what happened under the republican majority and a rubber stamp congress so shall it be written and so shall it be done e85 we talk about alternative fuels flex vehicles every magazine i open talks about flex vehicles here is the bottom line the republican congress have allowed these oil companies to be able to do anything they want to do when they want to do it this is an actual pump here at an exxonmobil station it says you cannot use your mobil credit card to buy e85 meanwhile we can continue to feed off the saudi arabian middle east what got us in this thing in the first place policies you can use your oil card there you can buy a bag of chips you can buy a carton cigarettes but e85 that is produced in the midwest versus the middle east you cannot use your mobil credit card for that and on retirement packages and i dont know very much about lee raymond but the bottom line is he is a retired executive from exxonmobil with a 398 million retirement package and a 2 million tax break this is what happens with a republican majority again the republican majority rubber stamp dont worry about balancing the budget democrats we tried to balance the budget we have done it before we have tried to do it under this republican majority not one republican vote to balance the budget on rollcall vote 87 march 17 2005 ranking member spratt and the budget committee put it forth again failed not one republican vote on rollcall vote 91 in 2004 their will and desire is not there the american people deserve balance minimum wage yes there was some bill that came up before we left for the break to talk about minimum wage a bill that the republican majority knew that the senate would not take up and would never make it to the presidents desk but because we were hammering them on it they said lets pass this they added all kinds of stuff it is called the potomac twostep this chart the bottom line is these are not minimum wage increases these are increases for members of congress this is our pay this is what we make oh look at them since 1997 there hasnt been an increase in the minimum wage and you not a minimum wage worker right now and i am not talking to the members of congress i am talking to the american people the bottom line is if the minimum wage goes up and that means if you are a salaried worker then your wages will go up but the bottom line is that it is a fact that the republican congress has said not over our dead body we are going to get our increase but we are not going to give the american people a minimum wage increase it goes on and on and on i am going to close with this the prime minister of iraq and the president of iran mr delahunt brought this picture out last night i dont care whichever way you cut 300 billion of spending over 2 000 troops thousands and thousands of american troops injured here in washington d c stay the course no plan the secretary of defense says if you talk about or say anything about redeployment of troops or withdrawing from iraq you are fired no question from the congress no response from the congress the secretary of defense is not called to the hill immediately the republican congress what are they saying they are saying nothing so accountability is not there they are embracing and guess what this is a la the unitedstates taxpayer through the republican majority because of a lack of diplomacy and a lack of plan and going to a war of choice versus after osama bin laden in afghanistan andgiving those troops in afghanistan the support they need so ms wasserman schultz mr ryan i rest my case the bottom line is that was not a message for democrats or republicans it was not a message for independents or the green party or other party affiliations that is a message for americans the bottom line is whatever you may feel if you are a member of the republican executive committee or you have always voted republican or you always voted independent you have to have issues with what the facts are i yield to ms wasserman schultz"], [0.000945746898651123, 0.9990542531013489, 1, "the republican majority is big on the talk in the stump speech and having the press conference with security homeland security all this kind of stuff but when it comes down to the printed word when it comes down to the budget that is handed out from the white house and when it comes down to what this republican majority does it is 2 000 from what the 911 commission called for and what we called for as house democrats versus the presidents proposal and you can look it up on line that only asks for 210 agents democrats fought for the funding on almost five different occasions again for the record ms wasserman schultz h r 1268 a motion to recommit and 2 000 vote number 160 and that happened on 5 5 05 also you look at house bill 2360 was blocked it was an obey amendment vote number 174 that was on 5 17 05 it failed 223 to 185 on a partisan vote h r 1817 a motion to recommit 2005 again vote number 188 again failed on partisan lines you start talking about on border security and closing the gaps on nine separate occasions over the last 5 years democrats put forth motions here on this floor because that is the only thing we can do being in the minority we are not able to bring the bills to the floor because the majority is blocking those bills from getting out of committee and they are noted right here and i am not going to go through that at this particular time but all of this is on line housedemocrats gov if anyone wants to go on and get this information also when you start talking about aviation security democrats offered a motion to require air cargo to be screened within 3 years the motion was rejected by republicans again 2005 vote number 188 5 18 05 democrats have spoken repeatedly on the issue of transit security making sure that we authorize including a 2 8 billion initiative to improve transit security and a 1 billion initiative to improve rail security substitute amendment defeated again so when you start look looking at the record and what the record says versus what is said here on the floor by the republican majority and the rubber stamp majority i wish the rubber stamp republican majority would stop fighting us and start saying to the president guess what we no longer want to rubber stamp everything that you send here i just wish the republican majority would just leader up and say hey mr president so you start reading the paper could someoneget me a newspaper please because i want to just have it as a prop because as americans start reading the paper they are reading about how republican members of the house and the senate the president flies into town they get on the plane and leave town some even get in their car and go i was on the other side of my district well let me tell you something if the president of the united states is in my district i think i would know i think it would be some sort of news flash or some sort of email that would come to me and say you know the president is coming in your district today will be in an elementary school maybe you want to be there he is the leader of the free world maybe you want to be there the reason why they are taking flights while the president is coming in the reason why they are finding something else to do while the president is in their town is the fact that they dont want to be caught in the same situation with the president of the united states because they have not stood up to the president and said no you cant put us in a financial situation as far as the eye can see as it relates to deficits and foreign countries running the world you cant pick up the paper today not talking about a republican running from the president of the united september 12 2006 co states and dont want to be around when the president is around or explaining why they are not there that is some excuse i hope i never get to the situation where i have the president of the united states coming into my district and i have to explain that i am somewhere else while the president is there and the bottom line is this people cannot face the music when it comes down to dealing with the policies of this administration and better yet you being in the position there is only 535 of us being in the position as i come in for a landing ms wasserman schultz to be able to bring about change on behalf of the american people to say this is not going to happen to say i know you want to start a war in iraq but we still got this business over here with al qaeda who had everything to do with 9 11 who trained the individuals that carried out the 9 11 plot but meanwhile while we are over therelooking for osama bin laden and we have him cornered i got this unfinished business the president said over here in iraq because i got a problem with this leader over here we got to take him out but what about the after player what is going to happen once you get to baghdad how are you going to bring stability who is going to be in the coalition calling up a couple of friends ill send 25 troops ill send 30 troops you are not allowed to talk about it everything is secret we have the then sitting attorney general comes to the unitedstates congress over on the senate side and tells the senate you are either with us or you are with the terrorists 0l 2340 what kind of mess is that so when it comes down to article i section 1 and if the american people want the kind of representation they need i am not talking as a democrat even though we were given an hour by the deqiocratic leader and we are all members of the democratic caucus this is america i guarantee you if the shoe was on the other foot ms wasserman schultz i cannot help but imagine the kind of chaos and protest and finger pointing and them and they and all of the things that will be said some of the stuff will have to be stricken from the record because the republican side will be carrying on about the democrats but they cannot say it they cant do it they cannot even kind of paint a picture because they have been in charge of the whole thing since it started so if the american people want a new direction if the american people want accountability if the american people want a house and a senate that will carry out article i section 1 of the unitedstates constitution and a lot of blood is on this constitution but if they want that then they will vote for a new direction in november i am done ladies and gentlemen with begging the republican majority to stand up on behalf of the american people because i am looking at what the oil companies are getting they are getting theirs i am looking at what these contractors are getting either it be katrina or the war in iraq they are getting theirs i am looking at the issue of health care and all of the people that are running to the bank with all of the dollars and all of the influence and all of the access into this congress they are getting theirs meanwhile we are sitting around here talking about the minimum wage and we cant even get a doggone bill passed off this floor to be able to provide the american people with a minimum wage meanwhile we are giving ourselves a nice fat pay raise every year 4 100 here 3 100 there oh we have the money for that but we dont have the money for the people who are punching in and punching out every day this has to come to an end and that is the reason why ms wasserman schultz that i believe there is a wind of change it may not be outside the hall of this chamber but it is out there in america it is in towns and it is in big cities and it is in emerging areas and it is in young people and older people that have decided in the past i am not going to participate but i believe they are going to participate to save this country"],

this administration has already accrued more foreign debt than the previous 42 presidents combined let me repeat that this president and this republicanled congress has borrowed more money from foreign central banks and foreign investors than the previous 42 presidents combined as you can see here in 2001 the amount of money borrowed from foreign central banks and from foreign investors was 988 billion that was troubling enough in 2006 we are up to 2 66 trillion that has been borrowed from foreigners unlike deficits in earlier years current deficits have been primarily financed by foreign investors with the rise in foreignheld debt equaling threefourths the increase in publiclyheld debt since the start of the current administration in 2001 this rise in foreignheld debt is troubling because it makes our econormy beholden to foreign creditors and represents another financial burden passed on to future generations foreignheld debt is fundamentally different from domesticallyheld debt since the interest payments on foreignheld debt flow outside the united states of america and reduce americans standard of living the cost of servicing foreignheld debt is high

the presidents fiscal year 2007 budget will harm millions of women and children around the country tonight you are going to hear from some of my colleagues about those specific programs that have proven to be successful for all women but are currently being cut and in some cases eliminated altogether the president is proposing to cut programs that disproportionately help women children the elderly and the increasing population of americans living in poverty earlier this month i was part of a recent delegation of members of congress who traveled to the gulf coast and new orleans where most communities are still struggling to clean up their homes and get back to sorme sense of normalcy after hurricane katrina we need to be doing more to help those those that lost everything to regain their lives these communities must have quality health care emergency care and safe environmental conditions but we cannot accomplish these goals and help the millions of women and children around the country who are living in poverty with the reckless and immoral budget that president bush has proposed key domestic programs that provide food and housing and support to women are vulnerable under this administration in fact the bush administration is determined to protect tax cuts for the very wealthiest of americans and provide health care for those who already have health care coverage and not include the 50 million uninsured people in our country today the president wants to eliminate educational support for women food assistance for seniors living in poverty and he wants to significantly slash funding from important safety net programs like medicaid and food stamps in just 4 years the cost of making these tax cuts permanent will exceed the amount that the federal government spends on education beginning in preschool through college where is the economic recovery that the administration promised real wages as we know are down the number of people living in poverty has increased job growth has been stagnant and tonight i am glad that so many of our colleagues ijn our congress the womens democratic congress who serve here are coming together to speak out against the presidents budget and how it is going in the wrong direction for women and their families i would like to begin by talking about education but first i would like to begin by addressing the presidents failure to address rising college costs with increased funding for student financial aid programs like the pell grant program and the perkins loan program before my election to public office i worked for the california student opportunity and access program and helped many young people in my community obtain the ideal of going to college and receiving financial aid because there was no other means to go to college the presidents budget currently continues to shortchange americas students who rely on financial aid to pursue their college education just one month after congressional republicans cut college aid by 12 billion 12 billion the president proposed a budget that eliminates decreases and freezes funding for much needed programs that are vital to helping students of color people from my own community low interest perkins loans are crucial resources as we know for college students who have demonstrated need twothirds of the perkins loan recipients are from families with annual incomes less than 40 000 a year yet the perkins loan program took a hit in the presidents 2007 budget and would recall 664 million from the federal perkins loan fund for nearly 1 800 colleges in the year 2007 and as a result 463 000 college students would lose a key part of their financial aid despite the record tuition increases that we all know are going through in our states bushs budget breaks his promise yet again of making college more affordable and he actually freezes the maximum pell grant in scholarships six years ago president bush promised to increase the maximum pell scholarship for all college freshmen at 5 100 fl 2100 this budget is now the fourth time that the president has frozen the pell grant access to financial aid as we know is a huge factor for many students particularly from lowincome areas like my own three out of four young latino adults who do not attend college cite the fact that without having financial aid they cannot continue to have the american dream about 40 percent of african american students and 30 percent of hispanic students depend on pell grants compared to 23 percent of all students young women just trying to improve their earning potential and get a better job also disproportionately rely on the pell grant program and i have to tell you when i was a student that was my means of going on to college my parents could not afford to send me to college they could not afford to give me a substantial amount of money to go to a university so thank god that we had federal financial aid programs available work study programs and the national student loan pro ram where i was able to attend a 4year institution to have my full tuition paid for including expenses and i thank god that our government at that time stepped up to the plate i cannot say that now under this administration but for the last 4 years now we have seen an increase of 57 percent in costs to attend college by this president we need to reject the presidents freezes and cuts to financial aid and help those students who want to go to college but the high cost of tuition is just way out of line when these students get to college we need to do more to encourage them to pursue fields that will encourage innovation and increase americas competitiveness and increase the number of women that seek access into the technical fields like science and math while women account for more than half of the number of bachelors and masters degrees awarded they make up a small number in the fields that are crucial to spurring innovation and job creation for example in areas like engineering computer science physical sciences and math only 21 percent of masters degrees in engineering were awarded to women for computer science and physical science women only eard about 35 percent of the masters degrees in the country the statistics are far worse for women of color like latinas and african american women and even asian americans within the small number of women who earn an engineering masters degree 11 percent are asian american a little over 4 percent are african american and less than 4 percent are latinas we need to encourage women to be part of the technical and skilled work force from school age all the way up to adulthood the presidents budget also eliminates the dropout prevention program and therefore ignores the big problem that we have currently in many of our communities where we see a number of our students dropping out of high school for the past 4 years the bush administration has cut funding for dropout prevention denying our mostneeded students the opportunity to succeed and in los angeles by the way only 29 percent of latinos and 47 percent of african americans actually graduate from high school this budget also freezes over 1 billion in current funding for ongoing programs including the gear up program the trio and upward bound program which are vital programs to many youngsters in our community many that attend and currently are enrolled in those programs are the first in their family to have the opportunity to be trained and have the motivation and support and mentoring that is needed to be successful in college with the president saying that he wants to zero out these programs he is sending the wrong message to my community and to communities across this country we need to beencouraging all of our young people to pursue higher education to keep america competitiv6 and to increase our productivity and economy with deep cuts to student aid proposed by the president we are closing the doors to eager students instead of providing a helping hand to those who want to learn who want to work and want to be a part of the society we must defeat this immoral budget to help our students achieve their goals and access all the opportunities that our nation can provide i would like to briefly speak about women in tfhe workforce once these young women who complete college graduate they face challenges in the workforce the wage gap among women and men continues to this day some of you may know that women earn on an average 76 cents to every dollar that a man earns instead of eliminating the wage gap and providing more opportunities for women to enter the workforce and earn good wages the bush budget continues to undercut and devalue womens contributions to the american labor force the bush budget eliminates the women in apprenticeships and nontraditional occupational programs this program which only costs 1 million per year provides grants to employers to help them recruit train and retain women in nontraditional and wellpaying jobs women who were a part of women in apprenticeship and nontraditional occupations projects were 47 percent more likely to enter higherpaying technical jobs than others the overwhelming lack of women in technical fields like science and math as you know is astounding even if women graduate with engineering and science and math degrees they are still faced with low salaries on the average women hold ph d s in computer science and engineering but still earn 9 000 less per year than their male counterparts latino engineers both men and women earn 10 000 less than the average salary for all engineers and african american engineers earn 8 000 less we need to encourage women to be a part of the technical and skilled workforce from school age right up to adulthood programs like women in apprenticeshlip and nontraditional occupations act are a part of that effort and i will work in congress along with my colleagues to reject the elimination of this or any other programs that help women achieve their dreams and realize their potential to be an important component of the technical workforce from the wage gap to discrimination we need to do more to help women succeed and support this vital and necessary part of the american workforce i urge all of my colleagues here today and

we could throw out there the numbers that people care about beyond just 2 500 of our soldiers being lost for example 18 490 american troops were wounded in iraq and we have thirdparty validation for all of these about 40 000 iraqis have been killed beyond the american troops 8 8 billion here are some more numbers 8 8 billion is the amount of iraqi reconstruction funds the military has failed to

chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this

hundred missiles in her war with iraq now the unitedstates and israel they are already spending hundreds of millions of dollars building a defense system against incoming iranian missiles if irans nuclear and missile programs go further then the united states and israel will have to commit hundreds of millions of more dollars to make sure that our allies in the jewish state are able to resist incoming iranian weapons i will note that a missile fired from iran aimed for example at telaviv would arrive just 11 minutes after lift off putting the middle east on a hair trigger given all of this the united nations reports of violations irans record of terror nuclear and missile developments all reported not by the cia or m16 but by the united nations what should we do some say that we should let iran have nuclear weapons that we cannot stop technology that we should not be able to classify the laws of physics and so iran will get nuclear weapons but if we acquiesce to this then this policy would commit us to a vast and expensive course of building missile defenses to protect our allies while the middle east would descend into a tense hair trigger peace one irrational leader one miscalculation and millions could die in a nuclear jihad it would also put nuclear weapons in the hands of the guardian council the same council that presidents carter and reagan and bush and clinton and bush all certified were the number one supporters of state terror the men and women who funded operations like the gentleman said who would put a suitcase or a car bomb in a western city i think we can do better some might say if this is so bad then let israel remove this threat by military means in fact in 1981 israel destroyed iraqs path to plutonium when it bombed the osiraq reactor but when we look at israel and a potential attack on iran we see a vastly complicated operation of great cost and a chance of failure at best such an operation could set back iran for a few years at worst it would enrage an enemy who would then use all of the means at her disposal to attack the jewish homeland an attack by israel on iran would also destroy what is our greatest longterm asset in iran her young people her young people who overwhelmingly report that they support better relations with america i think we can do better we can stand between appeasement under an iranian nuclear trigger

to the chairman for his work in so many different areas important and vital to the people of this country but right now at the issueat hand before us an area that is of utmost importance to the constituents in my district as well as the citizens of this nation and the world community as well so i thank the chairman for his steadfast dedication to addressing these problems also let me take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the chairmans staff as well for their efficiency in bringing these matters to the floor and their cooperation in working with our offices in order to proceed along on these matters i rise today to offer an amendment regarding possible contract abuses by highranking u n officials and to hopefully make the u n a more accountable and transparent body this amendment will ask the office of the comptroller general to submit a report to congress detailing the costs associated with the renovation of two u n buildings in geneva switzerland let my give my colleagues a little background michael wilson a friend of u n secretary general kofi annan who has referred to the secretary general as his uncle is being investigated by a swiss judge of possibly bribing a top u n official for a 50 million renovating contract at the world intellectual property organization it is alleged that mr wilson paid 270 000 to a top official at the intellectual property agency named khamis suedi in return the construction company mr wilson represented was to be awarded the construction contract for this renovation work here is the interesting connection mr wilson has also been a close business partner with the secretary generals son kojo annan in fact mr wilson helped get kojo a job at cotecna a swissbased inspection firm not long after hiring him cotecna was awarded a lucrative contract to inspect goods going to iraq with the newly implemented oilforfood program that we have heard talked about on this floor earlier kofi annan has continuously denied ever meeting with or supporting the cotecna contract proposal in fact the volcker commission appointed by kofi annan to investigate the oilforfood scandal in their second interim report that came out this spring came out andstated there is no evidence that the selection of cotecna in 1998 was subject to any affirmative or improper influence of the secretary general in the bidding or selection process however just this week a memo obtained from mr wilson around the time that the oilforfood inspection contract was being decided stated we had brief discussions with the secretarygeneral we could count on their support now the volcker commission only now is hastily reevaluating its initial findings in light of this new evidence and kofi annan as suspected is dodging questions and hiding now behind the commission i believe that the volcker commission has proven to be too cozy to the secretarygeneral to adequately assess the true depth of corruption in order to provide a full accounting of any illicit dealings to the american taxpayer the united states must continue its aggressive investigation and my amendment will further that goal even real estate magnet donald trump states in speaking about the proposal in new york city about their planned expansion of their headquarters the united nations is a mess and they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars unnecessarily on this project if donald trump says they are wasting millions of dollars i can only imagine what the average american taxpayers view must be on the u n investigations of the u n financial dealings under kofi annan resemble the peeling back of an onion the more that is cut away the greater the stench this amendment is a bold step i believe in slicing away one more slice of the onion another layer to reveal the full account of any illicit dealing at the u n i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.002141118049621582, 0.5021411180496216, 1, "i thank my friend from new jersey i want to rise to speak in favor of this amendment and commend my colleagues for coming together in a bipartisan fashion to recognize one of the more urgent needs that we have as a nation to prepare for the global competition that our children and grandchildren will face in the 21st century i think this is a very responsible amendment in light of recent reports that we have had a chance to decipher and analyze as members of the education committee from virtually all sectors of business iii this country the national academy of sciences have weighed in on an extensive study about the need for us to ramp up our investment in math science engineering technology what this amendment also recognizes is the critical link between foreign language studies and those entering the fields of math and science which is growing even more critical given the complex interdependent economic relationship that we have with so many people and so many countries and so many businesses throughout the world this is a critical need that this amendment recognizes and speaks to i want to especially commend my friend from new jersey for the leadership that he has provided not only to those of us on the committee but for the entire congress given his background and qualifications and expertise to speak on the subject of content knowl edge in math science and engineering he can correct me if i am wrong but i think one of his campaign bumper stickers that his volunteers and supporters were fond of handing out was that their congressman is a rocket scientist and we have had the pleasure of benefiting from that knowledge on the committee and he along with mr ehlers have been tireless in their advocacy for us to do more as an institution to ramp up the fields of study of math and science and engineering this is as mr dreier indicated consistent with one of the calls the president made in the state of the union address with the american competitiveness initiative that is something that i hope we all can come together in a bipartisan fashion to support and move forward on not just in a passing authorizing language but also the important appropriation in the funds to back up these programs the other issue that mr holt spoke to that i think is very important too is in regards to the adjunct teachers envisioned under this legislation teaching is different from private life you just cannot pluck someone off the street no matter how good and no matter how knowledgeable they are in the realm of business or in the research labs put them in a classroom and expect them to work miracles with the students we are hoping as we move forward with this legislation if it is accepted that there be preinservice training and screening with these adjunct teachers before they enter the classroom before they start working with these kids at such a crucial developmental age we have a long way to go as a nat in light of the current trends aroi the globe many of us on the educat committee last year had a chance ft couple of weeks to do a higher e cation tour of china to see where t are going china and india are clea two nations that are going to be v significant and influential in wc events in the 21st century we are ready starting to see that influe today china is a country that is not c tent with just being good at copy and mass producing they want be the cutting edge of scientific and m ical and technological discoveries need to recognize that in light of competition it will pose to our a dents in the 21st century and be will to support bipartisan amendments 1 this in order to makes these steps advance the cause of critical cont knowledge in these critical fields t will hopefully enable us to retain leadership in being the most innovat and creative nation in the world again i commend my colleagues their leadership and vision on t amendment i hope the rest of our c leagues will support it"]]}
