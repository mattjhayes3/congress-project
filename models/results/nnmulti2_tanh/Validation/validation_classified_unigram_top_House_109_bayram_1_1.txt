cuts of the few above the needs of the many under 1he republican budget the vast majority of americans are asked to sacrifice with one exception the wealthy who can most afford to give something up their tax cutsthe same tax cuts that brought us unprecedented deficitsare protected and even extended under this proposal they will cost our country an additional 106 billion of which 75 percent will go to people making over 200 000 a year in order to pay for those tax cuts the republicans are literally proposing to take away food and health care from lowincome families kill 48 education programs

instance they propose even greater cuts to medicaid than under his plan the 20 billion in medicaid cuts included in this budget resolution are unwise unjustifiable and almost certainly lethal as health care costs continue to rise the number of uninsured americans exceeds 45 million and employers continue to cut back on coverage medicaid has provided a guarantee of support for pregnant women

growing more slowly than private insurance premiums but if the republican budget cuts re enacted it may no longer be there for the millions of americans who have no other source of careother than bankrupting their families or mortgaging their futures to pay for their parents long term care needs or their childrens medical services budgets are not just about numbers they are about values and

proposed budget passes it would be a disaster for constituents in my home district on long island and districts nationwide forcing working families to make up for many of the cuts in the form of higher state and local taxes the american people deserve honesty and this budget is dishonest by omission and dishonest in how it portrays the overall budget projections the president claims that the steep budget cuts he advocates are necessary to cut the deficit in half in 5 years this is simply not true and the budget the president proposes fails to accomplish his stated goal first the budget is dishonest by omission nowhere in the fy06 budget does the president account for significant costs including fails to account for the enormous costs of privatizing social security as proposed by the president a whopping 6 trillion over the next 20 years 754 billion over the period from 20092015 fails to account for the continuing presence of our troops in iraqthe administration knows we are going to approve an iraq supplemental upward of 80 billion for the first part of this year aloneand an estimated 384 billion over 10 yearsyet still omits it in the budget fails to account for growth in interest costs fails to reform the alternative minimum tax that is disproportionately burdening middle income families in my district on long island as troubling as the glaring budget omissions is the knowledge that the deficit is largely a selfinflicted wound the president inherited a record annual surplus of 236 billionwhich now 4 years later has tanked into a deficit in excess of 400 billion any attempt at honest accounting suggests that we are looking at a decade or more of similar deficits the reason we are faced with an unethical budget is because the president refuses to acknowledge the fiscal irresponsibility of his choices and will not entertain even the most moderate suggestions such as repealing only the portion of the tax cuts that benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers unfortunately this budget builds on a disturbing trend this administration and the leadership in congress appear to be intent on valuing wealth over work thereby placing working families at a distinct disadvantage the tax policies the president advocates disproportionately advantage the wealthiest to the detriment of working americans and working families will continue to bear the brunt of the rising inflation spurred by the rising interest rates the bill gates of the world pocketed their tax cut at the insistence of the president however this president sees no problem eliminating funding for perkins loans in his budget even though the cost of tuition is rising and will continue to rise as the administrations policies force inflation as a result of the decision to eliminate perkins this year more than 670 000 student borrowers could lose out on loan forgiveness if they become teachers law enforcement officers or if they serve in the military this is just one of many examples of valuing wealth over work in my district the budget scales back and eliminates several longterm shore protection projects important to the safety and economic security of long island the president has no problem zeroing out the fire island to montauk point study just as it nears completion the president eliminates funding to dredge the patchogue river even though this creates a huge safety hazard for boaters the president does not hesitate to slash funding for the long island sound study office from 7 million to less than 500 000 even though this is vital to the livelihoods and economy of the east end of long island the president falls far short of his promise under the no child left behind bill even though this means that taxpayers will have to foot the bill at the local level to pay for education finally the president does not seem to mind taxing veterans health care at 250 per year and doubling copayments for veterans prescription drugs at a time when we should be saluting our

items important to my constituents and the american people to what congress is doing a disconnect is apparent an overwhelming majority of americans think it is long past due to increase the minimum wage over the past 6 years this congress has done little if anything to help those earning the minimum wage and the families who depend on them the buying power of the minimum wage is now at its lowest point in 57 years at the sara4 time the cost of key necessities like health care education and gas have been rising faster than inflation yet during the past 8 years members of congress have raised their own pay seven times by nearly 30 000 in those same years minimumwage workers have not gotten a single raise they continde to earn an average of 10 700 a year raising the minimum wage is a real tangible policy decision to significantly help 7 5 million americans who this congress has virtually ignored we can make this choice only by allowing an upordown vote on congressman millers

shortchanges americas children its families its workers and its most vulnerable citizens the laborhhseducation bill embodies our priorities and values as americans in it congress provides the yearly resources needed to keep our families healthy our children educated our workers employed and our most vulnerable citizens a productive part of our society this bill is arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation congress addresses each year chairman regula understands this responsibility he understands that this is the peoples bill and he has worked hard to distribute the limited resources he was given in a fair and conscientious way so my no vote today should in no way be seen as a lack of respect or appreciation for the efforts of ralph regula the chairman of the labor hhs appropriations subcommittee chairman regula and the staff of the subcommittee have worked within this tight budget allocation to address the needs and priorities of our states and communities as best they could under the circumstances for example the conference report includes increases in two critical areas to help infants and their families the first is the centers for disease control and preventions folic acid national education program this program has been instrumental in the prevention of birth defects by encouraging women of childbearing age to take the recommended amount of folic acid daily thereby decreasing the rate of neural tube defects the second increase is for the health resources and services administrations newborn screening program for early identification of infants affected by certain genetic metabolic hormonal and or functional conditions for which there are effective treatment or intervention in addition for the first time this bill also includes programmatic funding for the national media campaign to fight underage drinking which is being conducted by the ad council i thank the committee for helping our country make progress in these critical public health areas the presence of these and a small number of other positive programmatic funding levels however is simply not enough to warrant approving this conference report the constraints placed on this bill by the budget priorities and decisions of the republican leadership are not worthy of this house and the values of the american people i voted against the house bill when it came to the floor in june precisely because it fell soshort of meeting the needs of americas children families and the most vulnerable among us i had hoped that the bill would be improved in the conference it is unfortunate however that in this conference agreement the way they chose to improve overall programmatic funding from the original house bill levels was to take resources away from other priorities and community needs this report and its funding decisions do not stand in isolation they reflect the misguided priorities of a republican leadership that has continually put the interests of the wealthy and the privileged before the needs and priorities of working and middleclass americans this laborhhseducation conference report is a direct result of an economic agenda of tax cuts for the wealthiest americans and it weakens americas future by underfunding key education health and human services programs if approved this bill will impose cuts to essential programs important to americans in at least three major areas first this conference agreement significantly shortchanges our nations workers the bill cuts labor programs 430 million below the fy 2005 levels training and employment services for the 7 4 million americans who are unemployed are funded well below the fy05 levels this includes a 31 million cut to adult training grants a 36 million cut to youth training grants and a 141 million cut to unemployment insurance offices the unitedstates employment service office which matches job seekers with job openings is slashed by 10 5 percent and the report freezes funding for dislocated and older workers in addition the bill slices international labor affairs the program that helps eradicate abusive child labor practices and protect worker rights by 21 percent secondly this report is simply a reaffirmation of the administrations hollow commitment to education slashing the no child left behind funds by 784 million below the fy 2005 level it cuts the education technology block grant program that provides access to technology in schools by a shocking 45 percent from last years level it reduces the even start program supporting services for low literate and lowincome families by 56 percent and as a final point it shortchanges our children with disabilities by funding idea at 4 billion below the republican promise to put special education on a fast track to full funding finally the report is particularly devastating to the health of americans some of its most significant cuts are directed towards the critical programs that provide a health care safety net for the uninsured the conference agreement provides 34 million less than the house passed bill and 89 million less than the senate bill for grants to health centers for services to the uninsured the maternal and child health block grant is cut by 3 percent reducing its true per capita purchasing power by almost 20 percent below the fy 002 level the conference agreement terminates the healthy communities access program that makes grants to local hospitals health centers and providers so that they can provide better integrated systems of care for the underinsured and uninsured lastly as if cutting services wasnt enough the conference agreement virtually decimates the title vii health professions training programs cutting overall funding from 300 million in fy 2005 to 94 million in fy 2006 these drastic reductions to critical programs are not necessary ranking member david obey has consistently laid out a commonsense approach to this problem by simply reducing the tax break for those with incomes greater than 1 million we could add funding for no child left behind programs maintain college affordability by increasing the money for

wrong direction and next years deficit will likely be the largest in history with at least 400 billion added to the national credit card how does this blueprint make us safer while the department of homeland security receives an overall increase in funding the budget largely follows the presidents request which cuts needed resources for the first responders who risk their lives every day to protect us the spratt substitute contains 1 1 billion more than the republican budget for vital law enforcement programs such as cops fire grants and byrne grants these programs provide rhode islands police and fire departments with the equipment and training to keep us safe how does this blueprint make us healthier the republican budget requires 20 billion in cuts to medicaid this reduction will jeopardize a critical health care safety net for seniors children and people with disabilities and shift more of the burden to states medicaid cuts would result in 80 million less for rhode island the loss of federal funding places an enormous burden on states like rhode island by pressuring them to cut eligibility for medicaid my state has successfully leveraged federal medicaid dollars and currently offers coverage to many vulnerable lowincome pregnant women parents of young children and other groups not included in the federal mandate without medicaid these people would likely join the increasing ranks of the uninsured lacking proper preventative care these patients will be forced to go to emergency rooms leading to long waits and higher costs for everyone these cuts will also threaten programs such as rite share an employer buyin program funded in part by medicaid the republican medicaid cuts are restored in the spratt substitute how does this blueprint prepare children

disheartening because aid is needed and unfortunately the united nations refuses to allow its organizations like unhcr and unicef to operate in the country largely due to azerbaijans opposition because internally displaced persons remain within the borders of their home country primary responsibility for protecting and assisting them rests with their national authorities however i strongly believe there is also a responsibility that lies with the united states and the international community tobring rightful attention to this issue and consider ways to ease and eventually end the plight of these displaced individuals in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the soviet union was collapsing the people of nagornokarabakh made a peaceful request to reunite with armenia from which they were arbitrarily separated by joseph stalin in 1921 azerbaijan responded with a campaign of ethnic cleansing and fullscale military attack on nagornokarabakh as a result of azerbaijans aggression 30 000 people died and hundreds of thousands fled the region about 36 000 armenian refugees from azerbaijan and some 71 000 displaced ethnic armenians now reside in nagornokarabakh though the fighting has ended ceasefire violations continue and the victims are still suffering idps still face hardships including lack of economic opportunity and inadequate shelter refugees and displaced individuals and families deserve humanitarian support independent of their location however those in nagornokarabakh have not received adequate international assistance the international committee of the red cross

recognizing the ongoing need for humanitarian assistance theunitedstates congress has provided funds to nagornokarabakh since 1998 through various organizations usaid has implemented critical projects including the construction of homes improved access to water supplies and school reconstruction although these programs have helped improve living conditions much more is still needed so the un unfortunately refuses to operate in karabakh and does not send aid or organizations like unhcr and unicef there for assistance the reason given by the un is that they do not work in politically unrecognized territories yet it is my understanding that there are several other disputed territories where the un currently operates for example the un has been providing assistance to refugees in the west bank and gaza since 1950 in fact the un created a specific organization the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east to help palestinian refugees they have also undertaken work in other unrecognized or disputed areas including kosovo somaliland abkhazia south ossetia and transnistria the karabakh authorities have made repeated requests for help to the un for assistance but have been unsuccessful the uns refusal to work in karabakh is unfair and hard to comprehend since the un has been providing substantial assistance to refugees and idps residing in armenia and azerbaijan while overlooking the needs of similar groups residing in karabakh it is encouraging that the united states is committed to finding a peaceful solution of the nagornokarabakh crisis but as members of congress we must provide the leadership necessary for the un and other relevant organizations to find ways to support these refugees and idps i plan to send a

want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great

and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person

hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford president bush and the republicans it is time for a new direction we can begin by rejecting this estate tax giveaway to the wealthy and insist on a vote to increase the

state its a different political climate its a different political environment its altogether a different world we live in weve come a great distance its not just in georgia but in the american south i think people are preparing to lay down the burden of race if he said that under oath sworn to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth why is he telling the house something different today the reason he was under oath was because he was testifying in front of the department of justice that it was okay for the majorityminority districts in georgia to be diluted in direct violation of the voter rights act my other friend from georgia congressman scotr voted for that though it defies common sense this rewrite of the voting rights act gives no consideration to any changes that may have occurred since the first law was passed in 1965 the house is voting today to keep my state in the penalty box for 25 years based on the actions of the people who are now dead by the end of this renewal georgia will have been treated by federal law as a bad actor for 66 years to put that in perspective 66 years ago fdr was in his second term and the japanese were more than a year away from

eternally wear the scarlet letter because of the actions of their grandparents and greatgrandparents we have repented and we have reformed and now as fannie lou hamer famously said i am sick and tired of being sick and tired lastly this renewal is unconstitutional in 1966 the supreme court of the united states ruled that section 5 of the voting rights act the section that singles out certain states for federal oversight was constitutional only because it was narrowly tailored to fix a specific problem and temporary you dont have to have a law school degree to know that this rewrite of the voting rights act fails both of those tests at 41 years we are already way past temporary and the application of section 5 is now arbitrary because this house cannot present evidence of extraordinary continuing statesponsored discrimination in the covered states that is different from the rest of the nation as such section 5 has served its purpose and is no longer an appropriate remedy in light of

has failed according to the white house office of national drug policy coca cultivation in peru has increased to 94 000 acresthe highest level in eight years the international trade commission noted that any impact to narcotics trade from atpa is small and indirect yet the impact to the american asparagus producer is the exact opposite nevertheless here we are asking american farmers to sacrifice

has a simple purpose to make it easier for duck hunters stamp and wildlife art collectors and con servationists to do the things they love the bill does this by creating a pilot program in which 15 states authorized by the secretary of the interior may issue federal duck stamps electronically since its creation in 1934 the federal duck stamp program has become one of the most popular and successful congervation programs ever initiated because of it our country is again teeming with migratory waterfowl and other wildlife that rely on wetland habitats today roughly 1 7 million hunting and conservation stamps are sold each year recent data show that the sale of federal duck stamps has generated more than 700 000 000 in revenue used to preserve over 5 2 million acres of migratory waterfowl habitat in the united states the educk stamp act seeks to enhance the strong legacy of this important conservation program under this bill hunters will for the first time be able to purchase duck stamps online in a safe easy and convenient manner people living in rural areas like mine in western wisconsin will no longer have to gas up the truck to buy a stamp and instead can doubleclick their mouse and be ready to go hunt more importantly it provides this new alternative while protecting the legacy that the great duck stamp artist ding darling left us by taking explicit measures to

recognize that independent multinational election monitors have confirmed that yesterdays iraqi elections in which a remarkably large number of sunnis turned out to vote met international standards it is estimated that 10 to 12 million iraqis renounced fear and defied those who seek to demoralize them and to undermined unitedstates and international support for their noble commitment to rebuilding a civil society as we seek to encourage our friends in the middle east on their journey of selfdetermination let us take a moment to recall with an appropriate level of humility that our own democratic journey was neither quick nor easy and no less worthwhile for the difficulties endured this historic moment inspires me to highlight an outstanding bipartisan initiative here in the house

to fruition i also wish to acknowledge representative david price and my predecessor congressman doug bereuter for their hard work since 2003 to move this initiative and to make it a reality since the establishment of the commission in march 2005 members and staff have worked diligently to identify countries and legislative bodies in need of technical assistance the house democracy assistance commission has established an exemplary framework to help elected legislators develop badly needed parliamentary infrastructures to foster just and thriving civil society based upon democratic

gibran tueni a publisher and deputy at lebanons parliament was assassinated this monday in a bombing by those who fear the freedom that comes from selfdetermination just as our troops and over 22 000

the gentleman from pennsylvania and their staffs for their exemplary work on what is not easy legislation what i am about to discuss is something that has been brought more to light this spring than it had been brought heretofore buti think it is documented enough that we should try to add it to this bill it is a simple but in my judgment muchneeded amendment to the legislation before us today currently the department of defense spends over 200 billion annually to acquire products and services from defense contractors including everything from spare parts to major weapons systems in an effort to encourage contractors to perform at the highest level possible the department often gives its contractors the opportunity to collectively earn billions of dollars through monetary incentives known as award fees unfortunately while there is no doubt that unitedstates weapons programs continue to be the best in the world the departments acquisition process has at times run into problems such as dramatic cost increases late deliveries and significant performance shortfalls wasting billions of dollars in critical funding in response to these setbacks congress recently asked the general accountability office known as gao to study the departments use of incentives and the role they play in the acquisition system on april 5 the gao reported that the pentagons current incentive practices often do not hold contractors accountable for achieving desired outcomes and routinely undermine efforts to motivate contractor performance specifically the gao noted that the department regularly provides these bonuses to contractors often giving them second third and fourth chances despite the fact that the contractors work does not fulfill the departments expectations as part of its report the gao issued detailed recommendations for how the department could improve its strategy for using incentives to motivate exceptional performance the pentagon has concurred with the majority of gaos suggestions and during consideration of the fiscal year 2007 defense authorization bill in may i successfully included an amendment by voice vote that would implement these reforms while the language included in the authorization bill is a crucial step forward the effectiveness of these changes will ultimately be determined by how well gaos recommendations are executed the pentagon recently identified significant cost overruns in 36 of its major weapons systems with such costs rapidly increasing my amendment ensures that none of the funds provided in this bill will be used to continue the wasteful incentive practices identified by gao as the department moves forward in complying with gaos findings this amendment will provide an additional safeguard to make certain that these funds are not wasted in violation of the new incentive guidelines cost increases and business management weaknesses damage our governments ability to provide our men and women in the military with the resources to keep us safe while we obviously have a lot of work ahead of us to improve the efficiency of military spending i believe this amendment is a simple way to work with the department to make certain that incentives are being used to maximize its return on investment and provide soldiers with needed capabilities at the best value for the taxpayer"], [0.01480710506439209,

minutes in response on the currency issue section 6 in this legislation deals with currency manipulation it does not deal with china specifically and it requires the secretary of the treasury to define currency manipulation and describe actions of foreign countries that will be considered to be currency manipulation the problem is treasury has already done this and found that china was not manipulating its currency despite the fact that we know it undervalues its currency between 15 percent and 40 percent so i appreciate the gentlemans concern about the competitive problems that we have with american manufacturers and producers trying to compete with an undervalued chinese currency but this bill comes up very short but i very much appreciate what the gentleman said because we will be come back in a little bit and offer him an opportunity to really do something about the manipulation of chinas currency let me also point out while i am on the floor that legislation filed by the gentleman from new york h r 3306 would take action in this area by requiring the administration to initiate a wto action to address chinas currency manipulation now that would bring action consistent with our obligations under the world trade organization because we would act under the world trade organization that is what we should be doing let me suggest that when you file an action under the wto it is not the end of issues it is the beginning of a process to ask the secretary of the treasury to do another study or come up with another definition all we do is delay for another year any action against china and to suggest that there are minor adjustments that they made is in any way dealing with the underlying problems of currency manipulation is just unreal china announced today
