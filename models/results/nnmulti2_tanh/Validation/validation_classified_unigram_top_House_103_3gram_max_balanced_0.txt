i have reported on numerous occasions how well i had worked with the previous and the first investigating committee of the senate in italy with chairman carta at the time and how when we were refused documents on the orders of the late departed but not lamented attorney generals 3arr and thornburgh to such entities as the federal reserve board not to turn over documents to us we were very much able to obtain those same documents from the italian senate investigating committee also top bnl executives in rome were indicted in venice italy for their role in secretly financing the sale of over 100 million in armaments to iran in december bnl sued the united states department of agriculture as i had been saying all late last year and which our government through the state department and justice department were doing their beat to help bnl recover the s340 million from the taxpayers on defaulted iraqi loans that were guaranteed by the united states department of agricultures commodity credit corporation i ask my colleagues to look back into the record if you are interested to get the particulars anyway in the meanwhile in december bnl sued to recover over 340 million in defaulted iraqi loans that were guaranteed by the united states department of agricultures commodity credit corporation december also saw judge lacey attorney general barrs patsy announce that there was no need to appointment an independent counsel to look into the justice departments handling of the bnl scandal at best laceys probe was a whitewash of course judge laceys law firm did receive a bundle of taxpayer money for his strained and much discredited explanations true to form the bush administration stuck to the bitter end with its refusal to turn over all documents related to iraq and the bnl scandal requested by the banking committee and also subpoenaed by the banking committee top officials of the white house justice department cia state department and other agencies decided against turning over hundreds of bnlrelated documents requested or even subpoenaed by the banking committee finally in great britain john majors government felt the wrath of public discontent when government documents disclosed during the aborted matrixchurchill trial revealed that the highest levels of the major and thatcher governments secretly approved matrixchurchill export licenses knowing that the sophisticated machine tools were destined for iraqi armaments factories incidentally and by way of parenthesis those revelations came after contact by parliament members with us and then a member of the parliament of the mother country placing in public a display of the documents and mind you in great britain can you imagine what would have been done to me if we in america did not have the first amendment or if we had what great britain has which is actually censorship through their secret documents proviso which makes it a criminal offense but the british and the members of the parliament are far more attuned to their constitutional history than we are here so this member of parliament caused great exultation in great britain last year when he placed for public record in the record of the proceedings those documents the occurred machine tool transactions destined for iraqi armament factories through great britain despite a socalled british government ban on such sales the reason for the approvals was supposedly that united kingdom intelligence organizations mi5 and m16 were gathering information on iraqs technology procurement network through several matrixchurchill employees key players in the thatcher and major governments also argued for approval of the licenses under the pretext that the british machine tool industry needed the iraqi orders to stave off extinction whether the sales were for intelligence gathering purposes or to preserve british jobs or possibly both is impossible for us on this side of the atlantic to tell what is clear is that the iraqbnl scandal befuddled governments on both sides of the atlantic and revealed the dirty underside of policies that cannot differentiate between addition to the arms trade and genuine national interest there are still many unanswered questions related to the bnl scandal and the prewar iraq policy events such as the british version of iraqgate socalled raise many additional questions particularly as i have said before to us who are interested from the banking aspect and the protection of our very vulnerable system financial and banking system in our country i have gone into that before i will not now this is where we are headed we are trying to get the full information so that we can shape and mold legislation that this country has desperately needed and needs now more than ever this now amounts to almost 31 trillion that is working through the arterial system or financial system in the united states i would say that over 80 percent of that is involved in illegal drug money laundering operations direct and indirect should we not be concerned should we be obstructed in that endeavor i cannot understand the willful and the most bitter partisan attempts to try to gag us on the banking committee did the british government explicitly inform the bush administration that matrixchurchill had a united states affiliate operating in cleveland oh as we have brought out did the united kingdom government inform the united states that matrixchurchills exports to iran were being financed by an atlanta ga bank called banca nazionale del lavoro it seems impossible that britain would have gathered all this information about matrixchurchill and bnl and not share that information with our government this means that president bush must also have knownhow else can we conclude otherwisewhat saddam hussein was doing and decided to tolerate itthe evidence of this is clear and plentiful a myriad of questions need to be addressed before the banking committee ends its investigation not all the facts have been laid upon the table for the public to see evaluate and digest i pledge to continue the investigation until all important questions are fully investigated and satisfactory answers are obtained and we are in a good plain and explicit condition to offer the legislation our national interest demands the congress and citizens of this nation deserve no less than

support of house resolution 578 which would apply 10 employmentrelated laws to the house of representatives and establish an 5ffice of compliance to administer those laws i want to take a moment to commend the remarks of my colleague the gentleman from california in recent remarks and especially the remarks of our friend the gentleman from connecticut who along with our friend the gentreman from new hampshire is very very much responsible for bringing us as far as we have been able to get this year the charge that congress exempts itself from laws it passes for everyone else is one of the most frequently heard criticisms of congress and understandably so it is simply wrong to deny to congressional employees the same kinds of employment protections we grant to other employees and it is wrong to insulate ourselves from the effects of these laws as members are aware the house of representatives is in overwhelming agreement that we should apply these laws to congress which was demonstrated by our vote of 427 to 4 on favor of passing h r 4822 the congressional accountability act 2 months ago those of us who are strong supporters of this legislation were hopefulright up until the last momentthat the momentum generated by our strong showing on the vote would galvanize the other body to follow sult unfortunately that did not happen leaving us with no choice but either to implement as much of the congressional accountability act as possible by a rule of the house or to maintain the status quo which would mean continuing to be exempt from many of the laws other americans are subject to despite the shortcomings of applying these laws by house rule rather than by statute taking this approach is bqtter than doing nothing at all at this point by adopting this resolution we will improve the application of laws to the house in two ways first we will be covered by all the work place laws that the private sector is covered bynot just some of them as we are nowand second those laws will be administeredby a more independent authority than the one that currently administers antidiscrimination laws in the house to briefly review the background on this legislation as members are aware in recent years both the house of representatives and the senate have attempted to apply employmentrelated laws to congress it has been a difficult endeavor because we have had to construct a way to do so without breaching the separation of powers doctrine under the unitedstates constitution which could occur if the executive branch enforced these laws for the last six years the house hasapplied the fair labor standards act and other antidiscrimination measures to house employees through the rules of the house enforced by an internal system as congress has passed new laws such as the family and medical leave act we have enforced those new otober 7 1994 measures to the house under the same system however neither the range of laws we have applied to the house or the manner in which they are applied is comparable to the private sector not all the laws that apply to the private sector apply to congress and our internal enforcement process does not provide adequate recourse for aggrieved employees in addition there are wide variations in the coverage of laws among different groups of legislative branch employees establishing a new system for applying and enforcing these laws and expanding and making uniform the range of laws covering the legislative branch wasone of the key recommendations of the joint committee on the organization of congress which reported those recommendations last november the joint committee drawing from the original bill authored by the gentleman from connecticut and the gentleman from new hampshire recommended applying 5 laws to congress with the possibility of applying more and establishing a new more politically insulated entity the office of compliance which would be responsible for applying laws to the house the senate and other legislative branch entities it also recommended new procedures rights and remedies for aggrieved employees following hearings on this legislation by the subcommittee on the rules of the house in the spring and with further efforts by representatives shays and swett and others the joint committees recommended legislation was revised in several respects the result is that h r 4288 as considered and further amended by the house on august 10 was a much stronger much improved version of the compliance legislation included the joint committees bill it applied twice as many laws ensured full coverage of all employees of the legislative branch made the office of compliance a more independent entity and gave it more authority in the promulgation of regulations and ensured that employees would continue to be covered under the various laws we already apply here in the house until the new regulations developed by the office of compliance took effect as a result the resolution before us which reflects many of those improvements provides for the following first there are 10 employmentrelated laws that will be applied to the house of representatives they are the fair labor standards act title vi of the civil rights act of the americans with disabilities act the age discrimination in employment act the family and medical leave act the occupational safety and health act the federal labor management relations act the employee polygraph protection act the worker adjustment and retraining act and the rehabilitation act of 1973 only four of these laws specifically apply to the house at this time applying these six additional laws will more than double the number of laws under which the house is covered and i would like to point out that one of those additional laws is osha which is probably the most visible example of laws which privatesector employers must comply with but from which congress has exempted itself these laws will be administered by a new office of compliance which would replace the office of fair employment practices the office of compliance would be governed by a fivemember board of directors all of whom would be appointed jointly by the speaker and the minority leader the office would consist of an executive director who is appointed by the board and other staff to help ensure the independence of this new office the rule prohibits appointing to the board of directors current and former members current and former house employees unless their employment in the house was more than four years previous to their appointment and lobbyists the same restrictions except for lobbyists will also apply to the executive director the board will conducta study of the way in which the laws should be applied to the legislative branch and then follow that study with proposed regulations prescribing the application of the laws to the house of representatives unless the house rejects the regulations by resolution of disapproval those regulations will take effect if they are rejected the board would reissue new regulations however regardless of the status of regulations eight of these laws will be applied at the beginning of 1996 and the remaining two osha and the federal labor relations act will be applied at the beginning of 1997 the rule also establishes a process for resolving alleged violations of the law first counseling then mediation and then formal complaint and hearing an independent hearing board will review employee complaints and upon a finding of liability prescribe remedies consistent with those that are available to privatesector employees under the relevant law parties dissat isfied with the outcome of the hearing would have the opportunity to have a decision reviewed by the board of directors laws which currently apply to house employees shall continue to apply until the laws made applicable under this resolution are in effect this resolution also requires the office of compliance to study and recommend additional laws to be applied on a continuing basis and specifically to review the availability of information in the house and study the possible application of the freedom of information act and the privacy act the office would also be responsible for educating members officers and employees about their rights and responsibilities under the applicable laws and the office would be required to compile and publish statistics on the use of the office by house employees and to develop a system for collecting information on demographic data of employees and on employment in house offices although members should be proud of moving ahead with this longoverdue effort to apply to ourselves the laws that apply to other americans there are flaws and disadvantages to adopting this legislation by house rulean approach we are taking as i mentioned earlier only because of the failure of the other body to act on the legislation the house approved two months ago the most obvious deficiency in applying laws by house rule is that it covers only house employees not the thousands of other legislative branch employees many of these other employees have some coverage and some system of enforcement but one of the most important objectives of the congressional accountability act was to ensure that all legislative employees were covered under all applicable laws and that the laws were applied to everyone in a credible and effective manner clearly this rule will not meet that objective furthermore by failing to cover all employees inequities are certain to become apparent we know for example that because half of the capitol police officers are paid by the house and half by the senate half will be covered under this rule and half will not be that is not fair we also know that although we are applying osha to the house the workers for whom osha is most relevantthe employees of the architects officewill not be covered safety codes for our buildings will have to conform to osha standards but workers who make the buildings safe will continue to be exempt from the law that makes no sense another weakness in this approach is that aggrieved employees will not have recourse to the courts if they are dissatisfied with a hearing board decision and the boards review of that decision asprivatesector employees have that is because access to the federal courts can only be conferred by statute i share the disappointment of so many of our colleagues who have worked tirelessly on compliance legislation that we are here today considering this rule we had hoped right until now that our last action on the congressional accountability act during this congress would be the final approval of a conference report however adopting this rule will in no way preclude or hinder action in the next congress on a statutory approach to compliance it is my hope that as we adopt this resolution we will doso resolving to redouble our efforts on this issue in the next congress so that we can achieve full application of the laws in a credible and effective manner for the entire legislative branch of government in the meantime however adoption of house resolution 578 will make members of the house significantly more accountable for our actions as employers perhaps just as importantly it will give us a better understanding of the effects of laws every privatesector employer must live under and hopefully lead to more diligence and care and accountability for the laws we pass i urge my colleagues to support this resolution"]]}
