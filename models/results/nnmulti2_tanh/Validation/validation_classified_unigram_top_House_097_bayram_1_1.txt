be forced to live on less the 255 lumpsum death benefit will be eliminated when there is no eligible spouse or entitled child a more stringent recency of work test will prevent many disabled persons

tax rates on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their

major goal of american health policy since the rnid1960s has been the attainmient of equal access to health care that is access that does not differ because of income race or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better

than any other inland port in the nation at a time of energy problems the fuel efficiency of barges should be encouraged not discouraged according to the american waterways operators a gallon of fuel can move a ton of freight 59 miles by truck 202 miles by rail but 514 miles by barge since coal and oil are major barge cargoes the energy implications are multiplied the question in my mind is not whether barge traffic should continue to pay for maintenance of the waterways it should but we need to make certain that this mode of transportation is being treated equitably with rail highway and

on the amount a taxpayer may deduct for this purpose owners of mansions and vacation homes deduct all their mortgage interest payments out of all proportion to need i strongly favor consideration of a 5 000 ceiling on these deductions so the bulk of taxpayers do not have to pick up the tab for the wealthy a congressional budget office analysis indicates that the 5 000 ceiling would yield about 3 68 billion a year in additional federal revenue it would affect only 5 percent of all taxpayers and even they could deduct all but the excess over 5 000 if this modest reform were adopted half of the administrations proposed 1982 budget cuts could be restored in the following programs food stamps aid to families with dependent children ceta jobs elementary and secondary education basic education pell grants for college students legal services for the poor small business assistance housing and rehabilitation loans urban development action grants and support of the arts and humanities unlimited mortage interest deduction is but one example of a whole array of tax breaks or loopholes for the affluent that require serious attention before the needy should be deprived of basic help for food medicine shelter and jobs second everybody wants america to be strong with adequate wellequipped forces that can be deployed rapidly wherever they are needed and with a nuclear potential that is too powerful to challenge however i believe each addition to the defense budget should be treated with as much care as each cut from the nondefense budget as responsible a person as outgoing comptroller general elmer b staats pointed to several billion dollars a year in pentagon waste and mismanagement in a 23page letter to secretary of defense caspar w weinberger staats itemized such costreduction opportunities as consolidating adjacent military bases joint supply purchases improved management of weapons systems and multiyear contracting that would save an absolute minimum of 4 billion a year by 1985 opinion polls indicate considerable support for the presidents budget goals most of the mail which i receive in my office is written by individuals in general support of the presidents goals i should point out however that a good number of the letters contain a similarity in phraseology that may be more than coincidental be that as it is some of these individuals indicate in their letters that if i did not support the president i would be regarded as an obstructionist further i was also reminded in no uncertain terms that these individuals would remember me in a not too favorable light at the next election james wilson makes a point that each of the great powers executive legislative and judicial should be independent as well as distinct lectures on law the works of james wilson the division of the powers of the national government was established for a purpose and that was to avoid a concentration of power in any one branch i think the citizens of this country would be illserved if this body were to adopt the course of action recommended by some and that is simply to trust the president and approve his program without the needed scrutiny edmund burke in his speech to the electors of bristol stated that your representative owes you not his industry only but his judgment and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion the course of action advoctated by this administration deserves very careful examination because we are not simply considering a request for a reduction in federal expenditures we are considering a reordering of priorities the effect of which if adopted will be felt by many low and moderateincome individuals the programs which we are considering reducing are ones which meet the needs of those most in need of assistance we should examine these proposals very closely the economist in its latest issue states thatalthough the reagan budget attacks nearly 300 programmes including some dear to the hearts of even mr reagans supporters its main effect will be felt negatively on the poor and positively on the defense industry social justice should not be sacrificed on the altar of an untested economic theory and that it seems to me is what we are about to do if we adopt without careful examination this administrations still unclear proposals i am not advocating delay for the sake of delay that

"i rise in support of the grammlatta bipartisan substitute because it emnbraces the presidents program for economic recovery and represents a substantial departure from previous economic policies of higher spending and increased taxes last november 4 the american pcopole unmistakably recognized that it was these same policies which have led to sustained doubledigit inflation high unemployment and interest rates and a slowed national productivity growth i truly believe that unless we act now to change our past economic course these statistics based on the old policies of higher spending and taxation will continue to accumulate there are two very important reasons why i urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan substitute first it will restrain federal spenlding there can be no doubt that gloverment spending has literally exploded consider these facts payment of interest on the national debt for 1982 will almost equal the entire budget expenditures for fiscal year 1961 the national debt is more likely a national disgrace as it is currently just under 1 trillion washington presently spends 22 000 every second of every day in 1970 the government spent over 196 billion today we are considering a budget of 688 billion under the grammlatta substitute or roughly over 710 billion if all other proposed substitutes are considered by adopting the grammlatta bipartisan substitute we will restrain federal spending to 6 1 percent in 1982 as compared to previous spending growth of 16 percent from 1979 to 1981 federal spending and revenues will decline to 19 3 percent of gnp by 1984 as opposed to 23 0 percent and 21 2 p~ercent presently for 1981 furthermore the grammlatta substitute proposes smaller spending levels than has been proposed by any of the other budget alternatives being considered by the house by at least 21 billion in fact spending by the grammlatta substitute is 6 5 billion smaller than spending proposed by the administration the important point is that by adopting the grammlatta bipartisan substitute federal spending will still be larger than any prior year but it will be restrained many refer to the presidents proposal as cuttig the budget when actually all he is asking for is a reduction in the amount of increased spending for each year my second reason for supporting the bipartisan effort is that it leaves room for enactment of the reagan tax reform program which provides for sufficient tax relief to peopleespecially 97 million working peopleand to businesses the burden of taxes on individuals and businesses has become oppressive in 1965 only 6 percent of all taxpayers faced marginal tax rates of 25 percent or higher today almost40 percent of all taxpayers face rates of 25 percent or more the average worker must now pay his entire salary to taxes from january 1 to may 11 the previous administration estimated that tax receipts as a share of gnp would grow to the unprecedented level of 22 8 percent by 1984 ac cording to the house budget committee report page 31 in 1981 federal receipts are projected to exceed 21 percent for the first time since 1944 oliver wendell holmes jr once wrote the power to tax is the power to destroy the economic policies of the past several years have most certainly shackled american initiative and destroyed incentives to save work and investthe fundamentals of productivity the reagan tax plan relieves this tax burden first by keeping real taxes from increasing during the next few years and second by providing the necessary incentives to american workers and businesses to turn the economy around from a nogrowth situation to one of high growth president kennedy pointed this fact out in december of 1962 in a speech before the economic club of new york an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budgetjust as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits in short it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too lowand the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut rates now in the same way the reagan tax plan will reinvigorate the economy by restoring incentives for savings invest ment and entrepreneurship and by renewing optimism and confidence just as the kennedy tax cuts of 1964 and 1965 did enactment of tax relief in this form recommended by the president will allow the private sector to grow rapidly enough to provide new jobs without contributing to inflation and will restore the ability of the united states to compete effectively in world markets ilet us give the american people the new beginning that they voted for and still overwhelmingly support the administrations measures as embraced by the grammlatta bipartisan substitute will provide for a longterm foundation and commitment for stable fiscal and budgetary policy the federal budget will be balanced on economic strength and prosperity not artificially through increased taxes or spending we can no longer continue policies which wait and see before taking action president reagans fourpoint comprehensive package changes these past fickle economic policies one thing is certain if only a part of the package is passed by the congress we will get only a part of the solution as president reagan addressed the nation on february 5 1981 its time to recognize that weve come to a turning point were threatened with an economic calamity of tremendous proportions and the oldbusinessasusual treatment cant save us together we must chart a different course my dear colleagues

persons who have had authorized access to classified information from revealing the identity of certain covert intelligence agents i support the effort to punish those who would abuse their positions of trust to the detriment of the lives and safety of our intelligence agents overseas as well as unitedstates national security interests on the other hand the third category section 601 c of the bill however well intentioned in its effort to prevent exposure of our covert agents tramples on protected first amendment freedoms for the first time in american history the publication of information obtained lawfully from publicly available sources would be made criminal i recognize and applaud the efforts made by the intelligence committee to narrow the scope of section 601 c to keep it within constitutional bounds nevertheless it is my firm belief which is supported by many noted constitutional experts that no amount of tinkering can rehabilitate a law which crimianalizes constitutionally protected freedoms of speech press and political expression moreover the bill allows no exception where disclosures are aimed at revealing illegal activity oversight of our intelligence activities traditionally exercised by all the american people the press and the congress will instead be relegated solely to the two already overburdened intelligence committees recent events concerning the disturbing activities of the top echelons of the cia d6monstrate that greater accountability is necessary rather than less the best solution is to concentrate our efforts to improve the cover provided the cia and any other covert agents operating on our behalf overseas not to create criminal penalties which stem the flow of information only to our o~wn public and do little to protect our agents from hostile powers overseas i urge you to vote against this bill and i ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks i firmly believe officers employees and sources that operate covertly on behalf of american foreign intelligence must be protected from harm and exposure i share the alarm of my colleagues arising from callous and irresponsible disclosure of names of covert agents however i believe that the goal of maintaining secrecy and minimizing risk of harm can be achieved by less onerous means the portion of h r 4 which i question is section 601 c this section is aimed primarily at private citizens and the press who gain knowledge of agent identities from either public or classified sources in both instances first amendment interests are compromised the intelligence committee attempted to alleviate the adverse impact on the first amendment by adopting language that narrows the intent requirement criminality hinges on a finding that the identification was made knowingly with an intent to impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the united states and in the course of an effort to identify and expose covert agents and by adding a requirement that the disclosure intend to impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the unitedstates by the fact of such identifileation and exposure while i applaud the committees efforts i remain convinced that no amount of tinkering can render this section constitutional as long as it seeks to criminalize publi cation of information already in the public domain these judgments all are highly subjective thereby leaving the door open for less cautious officials to level this provision at a broad class of individuals many acting within the constitution the requisite intent can be inferred whenever the publication exposes and thereby diminishes the effectiveness of an intelligence agent or activity further the intent requirement itself may have the effect of chilling legitimate critique and debate in addition it is clear that the name need not actually be revealed to constitute identifying information in some circumstances simply noting the agents title and location may be sufficient to reveal his identity thus the number of details that must be omitted and the consequent loss of credibility is also a vague expandable concept finally the concept of in the course of an effort offers no real protection as a society of professional journalists witness noted during the debate on this bill last year a journalist who is assigned to cover the intelligence community on a regular basis may indeed establish a pattern of reporting the names of agents or sources in the course of legitimate coverage of the cia furthermore even if the revelation was a single story or a single incident it is not clear that the act of investigating the story and preparing to publish it are insufficient to meet the governments concept of effort the department of justice repeatedly has emphasized that the effort need not consist of a pattern of disclosure but rather may be simply a pattern of acts with a purpose of disclosing i am not alone in this view distinguished constitutional scholars from around the country have also criticized section 601 c and its predecessors as being both unwise and unconstitutional consider this from stephen saltzberg of the university of virginia law school when it comes to punishing people who have figurcd out the identity of an agent on the basi1s of information available to the public i think there are enormous problems to overcome in fact they cannot be overcome when all is said and done i recognize that the intent element of section is it really permissible to prevent people from trying to get the government to change its ways by publicly disclosing what has been going on in order to criticize it i doubt it the line between an intention to impair the intelligence activities of the united states and an intention to seek a modification of the intelligence activities of the united states is one that is too fine for me to perceive of course the first amendment involves balancing of interests the need for the united states to protect its officers and agents is surely real and great but the first amendment is at its strongest when people are speaking out against the government criticizing what it and its agents are doing and i think the balance here will be in favor of speech section 601 c prohibits publication of identifying information even if the reporter or private individual derived the identity or identities wholly from public sources this includes disclosures based upon inferences drawn from the governments own nonclassifled documents it includes the publication of common knowledge as to who is a cia agent or source in a particular area it includes the revelation by an organizationt such as a missionary church newspaper or university based on its own internal lnve~tigation that some of its memberscontrary to the organizations policyhave acted as sources for the cia it includes republication of disclosures made by others the limit on how public this information must be before prosecution will is left to the discretion of political appointees moreover section 601 c criminalizes disclosures under a wide variety of circumstances try as the house intelligence committee did to limit the bill i still believe it will forbid both wanton and callous disclosures as well s those that serve a socially useful purpose it will create an unprecedented dilution of the notion of what constitutes freedom of speech and the press by eniminalizing the utterance of publicly available information without a showing that the national security is at stake indeed there is no requirement that any adverse impact be felt by reason of the disclosure in order to constitute a crime i am also concerned about the wide range of individuals covered by this legislation i believe this overinclusiveness adds to the constitutional problems of this bill a covert agent is defined to include not only intelligence officers or employees serving covertly outside the united states but also anyone who is a present or former agent of or a present or former informant or source of operational assistance to an intelligence agency informant is defined broadly as any individual who furnishes information to an intelligence agency in the course of a confidential relationship protecting the identity of such individual from public disclosure it is clear therefore that thousands of individuals fit this description and that the bill is primarily a source protection bill for the cia and the fbi regardless of the merits of their need for protection the breadth of the definition broadens the restraint of free speech furthermore it is not clear that protecting the identity of sources who may be in no greater peril than any other law enforcement informants weighs as heavily against the need for open discussion of american foreign affairs as does the protection of employee identities indeed the original position of the attorney general when this bills predecessor was under discussion last congress was solely to protect from harm the men and women who serve our nation as intelligence officers likewise the fbi director in seeking fbi coverage originally spoke only of employees this expanded purpose should alert us to the danger of future additions to the definition of disclosures that impair american intelligence activities congress could criminalize the disclosure of many other matters derived from public information such as the content of the covert activities themselves the methods used and so forth the fact that those activities may have been in clear violation of american law or policy would be no defense how will the line bedrawn when so much information relevant to public debate arguably could impair or impede intelligence activities or foreign relations or national defense for these reasons i believe this coverage is vastly overbroad and fundamentally at odds with a free society it is also unnecessary section 601 c simply misses the markit aims thearsenal of the criminal law at the entire populace but all the available evidence indicates that the true culprit is the combination of sloppy secrecy procedures and unauthorized disclosure of classified information in other words section 601 c of the intelligence committee bill attacks a phantom problemprivate citizens culling through public documents and sources it thereby diverts attention from the real heart of the problem which as the cia itself admitted is the disclosure of sensitive information based on privileged access by faithless government employees 0 this problem can be dealt with by punishing those employees and former employees who breach their trust by revealing identities or by providing assistance to others in identifying covert agents moreover if indeed it is possible to glean identities from public information or doeuments then it is the responsibility of the cia and the president to remove those indicators from the public domain and to improve the procedures for insuring effective cover criminalizing disclosures stemming from sloppy secrecy procedures on the other hand will only tend to lull the agency into inaction surely if private citizens have been able to infer identities from public sources so too has the kgb as the house permanent select committee on intelligence act 1coinplelled to note that provisions for the concealment of intelligence operative are not fully adequate the burden must be on the executive branch generally and the intelligence community in particular to remedy this situation accordingly the committee adopted a provision requiring the president to promulgate procedures that will help to rectify this situation i believe this course of action will be more productive and certainly less destructive of free speech inever before has a criminal sanction been attached to this kind of speech the cia insists that it is necessary but it is the responsibility of congress as well as the courts to determine whether such a measure is constitutional or whether a less onerous alternative will deal adequately with the problem in concluision i believe this bill is dangerous not only for what it forbids directly but also for the precedent it creates today we ban the disclosure of identities tomorrow there will be talk of banning disclosure of covert actions themselves why not the logic is the samethe preservation of effective foreign intelligence efforts if the american people are denied information they are denied the power that the constitution says resides with them preventing that is what the first amendment is all about ultimately it is the respect and protection we afford free speech that distinguishes this country from the nations within which the cia secretly september 93 1981 septcmber 23 1981 coi operates if a free society is sacrificed for

discuss what i believe is the most difficult and critical problem facing the united states the decline in productivity growth i said then that congress had to focus its efforts on putting the puzzle together and launching a comprehensive strategy to improve productivity although productivity was at that time already a buzzword on capitol hill little was being done about it and the outlook was not encouraging unfortunately i am afraid the same can be said today there has been so much talk on the subject of productivity that perhaps it is worth reminding ourselves why prompt action in this area is so important as i see it there are at least four reasons why improved productivity must be a top priority for the federal government first and foremost i believe productivity is the neglected longterm key to our fight against inflation it is obvious that when the costs of labor raw materials and physical plant increase those higher costs will be translated entirely into higher prices for goods and servicesunless productivity is improved the second point is closely related low productivity growth is contributing to the weakening of the dollar by reducing the competitive edge of american products and thereby undermining the balance of trade third steady productivity growth is important to expanding employment here the relationship is perhaps less obvious and may contradict the assumption among rmany people that productivity simply means fewer people doing the same amount of work but as we should learn from the current discussions of supplyside economics more costeffective production is the key to business expansion and thus to expanded employment finally these benefits add up to a social or political argument for a strong productivity policy as we have progressed through successive antiinflation policies in the last few years americans have been asked repeatedly to make sacrifices i believe the country is willing to make those sacrifices but only if there is a visible and realistic path toward improvement ahead to date there has not been a comprehensive and coherent policy for improving productivity can provide that crucial glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel when i addressed the house a year ago on this subject the economic report of the president for 1980 had just been released that report was rather fatalistic on the question of productivity since it is difficult to identify a single cause for a slowdown in productivity growth the report declared the immediate prospects for improvement in productivity are not good the attitude of mr carters council of economic advisors eventually improved the final economic report of president carter released in january abandons last years gloomy prognosis and asserts unequivocally that a program to stimulate productivity growth must be a keystone of economic policy intentions however have yet to be transformed into reality the sad fct is that there is no federal program to foster productivity improvement several federal activities scattered among various agencies and amounting to more than 2 billion do contribute to private sector productivity but the closest the federal government has come to establishing a productivity program which might coordinate these disparate activities and set clear productivity improvement goals is a deservedly obscure entity known as the national productivity council established by president carter under an executive order in october 1978 the record of that productivity council is a travesty upon its very name since 1978 the council has convened on exactly four occasions and has garnered a barely fulltime staff of two people with no funding last year i characterized the council as an interagency group which rarely meets and accomplishes little this year i am spared the embarrassment of repeating myself since the general accounting office in a thorough evaluation which has just been released has provided its own assessment the gao notes that the key responsibilities assigned by the president to the productivity council were first coordinating and supervising productivity activities throughout the federal government second identifying for the president and the congress key issues pertaining to productivity improvement and third serving as a focal point within the executive branch for productivity issues with special liaison to business labor and academic leaders on this subject the gao report concludes that the national productivity council has not effectively accomplished any of these functions in other words as a government and as a nation we have been wasting our timetime which we cannot afford to lose the councils inactivity has coincided with a 2year period of national productivity declineonly the secondand now the longestsuch period since world war ii the councils poor performance would be less discouraging if it were an isolated event unfortunately it is the fifth unsuccessful productivity group to be formed at the federal level in the past decade against that background of past failure i welcome president reagans determination to make a fresh start i am particularly pleased that the president has given productivity a high priority in his recent statements and i look forward to working with him toward that end i am today reintroducing legislation which i first offered a year ago which would create a statutory visible fully funded and fully staffed national productivity council this proposed council is fashioned upon recommendations of the general accounting office and i believe it can succeed where its forerunners have failed this council would be assigned specific and important responsibilities which the gao has concluded on the basis of its past experience will be essential to a successful federal productivity effort these responsibilities will include first the formulation and annual revision of a national productivity improvement plan second analysis of those federal activities which hinder or encourage improved productivity in the private sector third legislative and regulatory recommendatiods to the congress for enhanced productivity fourth consultation with representatives of business labor and academic institutions on the subject of productivity improvement and fifth coordination of various federal activities related to productivity why do we need this council above all because when we have 2 billion worth of independently evolved programs affecting productivity we need to have some coordination of them we need to analyze the effectiveness of our total effort to assess where the gaps are in that effort and to discover what more could be done for example in its recent report the gao found that current federal expenditures in the area of productivity were not evenly distributed among activities related to productivity less than 2 percent is spent for improving human resources through programs for skill training hiproved labor mobility job security and labormanagement cooperation the report found i believe that an active forceful and respected national productivity council could help to redress such imbalances by calling them to our attention and by suggesting corrective measures the council could similarly restore a balanced perspective to the current obsession with business investment as the total cure for lagging productivity certainly increased capital formation is an important component of any effort to improve productivity but investment alone is not the answera fact which we are in danger of forgettiog today we are poised on the brink of accepting a multibilliondollar tax cut for accelerated business depreciation which has been promoted as a panacea for declining productivity growth yet as even business weeks analyses have shown the capital cost recovery act has a highly differentiated effect on various industrial sectorssome benefit greatly others benefit very little as we well know there is already a considerable range of productivity growth rates within the private sector the proposed tax benefits of the 1053 legislation do not always correspond to the sectors in need as pat choate and gail schwartz point out in a recent book on sectoral revitalization we need to know whether acrosstheboard tax incentives would encourage the flow of capital into those vital industries that need it the most in order to modernize and ultimately become more productive the historical precedents would suggest the opposite faced with such crucial policy dilemmas i am convinced the existence of a professional national productivity council could be extremely helpful we need a neutral third party whose sole concern is the federal impact on productivity and to whom we can turn for reliable advice in short we need an unrelenting spokesman who will keep the issue of productivity uppermost in our minds and make us aware of how federal policies affect it there is of course considerable hostility today toward any proposal to create a new government organization not surprisingly some of that antagonism was directed last year toward my proposal for a new productivity council let me assure those critics that i share their skepticism and their concern about government bureaucracy moreover i fully acknowledge that the crucial decisions affecting productivity growth will be made in the private sector nevertheless we must face the fact that we live in a mixed economy and that a federal government which spends more than 22 percent of gross national product and whose taxing and regulatory policies broadly affect the private economy ought to have some agency within it that attends to the nations no 1 economic problem governments of other industrialized nations such as japan and west germany are much more involved with labor and business in developing a consensus policy for maintaining high productivity growth we would do well to take our cue from their success my proposal for a statutory productivity council would not add to the burden of government but rather would respond to a serious weakness in governmental performance as the recent gao report noted all key economic decisionmakers in recent years have recognized the importance of productivity growth to our economic strength yet when economic policies are made productivity concerns seem to be given low priority the new productivity council would not be an economic deci sionmaker but would participate in economic and budgetary decisionmaking to ensure the presence of a productivity perspective naturally some members will not be persuaded that spending 5 million on a productivity council to oversee 2 billion in current productivity programs is a worthwhile investment to these colleagues let me offer a more compelling costbenefit analysis as a 1978 report of the council on wage and price stability observed the effect of slow productivity growth since 1967 has been to reduce total real incomes by some 20 percentmore than 300 billionfrom what they would have been if the pre1967 productivity growth rate had been sustained clearly we cannot afford not to invest in a more productive future last summer the retiring chairman of the house subcommittee on economic stabilization scheduled 4 days of hearingswhich i chairedon the problem of lagging productivity growth and what the federal government should do about it in my opinion those hearings were very useful in sharpening our understanding of this issue in particular they reinforced my conviction that something like a statutory productivity council is needed in the executive branch i would like to take a few moments to share with my colleagues some highlights from those hearings which in my view strengthen the case for the legislation which i am reintroducing today during the initial hearing testimony was given by an associate director of the office of management and budget omb on behalf of the current productivity council ombs presentation revealed a startling devaluation of the productivity problem high inflation and energy problems which dominated the 1970s omb testified must be solved before the productivity growth rate can be restored to its previous level when during quistioning of the witnesses i suggested that this statement reflected a disturbingly passive approach to the productivity issue 0mb simply reaffirmed its view that productivity growth will result when the economic policiesof the administrationtake hold this determination to put the cart before the horse says a good deal about why the existing productivity council has been such an abysmal failure most experts in this field i think would agree that lagging productivity growth is a major component of inflation rather than the other way around no productivity council worthy of the name can succeed when it is a captive of ombs perspective on this point one of our subsequent witnesses economist lester thurow from the massachusetts institute of technology saw the issue much more clearly productivity is obviously the countrys number one problem when productivity is going downhill it doesnt make any difference what is happening to inflation or enemployment you are going to have an economy thats going downhill although the public opinion polls havent put productiv ity in the number one slot 1 think the congress ought to put it in the number one slot at one point in the discussion i asked mr thurow whether he thought the united states would benefit from some kind of independent group that might be perceived as a little less partisanthan the congresssuch as a national economic commission or a national productivity council professor thurow largely concurred i certainly think there is a lot of value in information especially in the productivity area productivity is one of those kind of background things whiph doesnt make the headlines well we are not going to address the productivity problem until the american people in fact decide that it is an important problem that they have to address one of the traditional barriers to productivity efforts on a national level has been the opposition from many sectors of the labor movement which feared from past experiences that productivity was just another name for speedup or reduced labor force thus some of the most instructive and encouraging testimony received by our subcommittee came from mr donald ephlin a vice president of the united auto workers in his opening statement mr ephlin underscored his own unions willingness to tackle a tough issue we recognize that the only reliable basis for improving the purchasing power and access to leisure of american workers is the increase in the economys capacity to convert a given amount and intensity of work into ever more output in keeping with that recognition the uaw has explicity pledged not to oppose the introduction of productivityenhancing laborsaving technological advances on the specific subject of my legislation to create a statutory productivity council mr ephlin observed that the uaw is in strong support of objectives mr ephlin went on to make a crucial point with respect to a productivity councils potential effectiveness the national productivity improvement plan that the council is directed to develop will not be regarded as authoritative and viable unless it incorporates the agenda of labor and business by including them in the proposed council a tripartite committee would be created the parties would have the opportunity and the responsibility to find a common ground between often conflicting sets of goals as a public official who has been involved in the labormanagement cooperation movement for many years i have seen what it can achieve in the area of productivity and i wholeheartedly agree with mr ephlins tripartite proposal the legislation i am introducing today does create an advisory board to the productivity council whose members are to be selected entirely from individuals with experience in business labor and academics the bill does not take the further step of placing such individuals on the council itself but i am quite open to that possibility and will be exploring that alternative structure in the weeks ahead appearing on the same panel with mr ephin dr richard rahn vice president of the unitedstates chamber of commerce endorsed the same notion of tripartite communication among business labor and government but added i dont think there is a need for a formal government intervention in this process fortunately not all of the probusiness community seems to feel the same hesitation for example the american enterprise institutes committee to fight inflation chaired by former federal reserve board chairman arthur burns recently issued a ninepoint antiinflation plan i was pleased to note that in one of those points the committee urged congress and the president to actively encourage labormanagement councils in individual shops offices and stores throughout the country so that workers and managers will jointly seek ways of improving productivity perhaps the most persuasive testimony from any witness last summer was the presentation from the american productivity center this private nonprofit organization based in houston tex has done pioneering work with numerous businesses to improve productivity the organization is chaired by c jackson grayson former head of southern methodist universitys business school and was represented at last summers hearings by one of its directors mr william usery former secretary of labor mr usery had this to say on the productivity council legislation which i am sponsoring although i and the american productivity center believe that h r 6462 may not go far enough in its particulars we believe it is a most important step toward a firm commitment by our government to improve productivity efforts within the private sector have proved successful but are limited by the relative absence of government commitment to implementing solutions one might expect a private organization like the american productivity center to dismiss a government productivity group as intrusive and unnecessary on the contrary however mr usery explained in some detail the benefits which the center anticipates would result from a federally formulated productivity improvement plan the federal government would be helping to bring together elements of the business labor and government communities such a friendly meeting of the minds would be beneficial to america and certainly beneficial to productivity the concept of a national productivity policy has many advantages over other economic measures we have already tried other measures such as cutbacks controls regulation spending subsidies protectionism the result has been in most cases a failure a successful productivity program promises to avoid the problems inherent in these other actions no one expects that a national pro ductivity council by itself will reverse the deceleration in americas productivity growth productivity is an enormously complex issueone which must be addressed simultaneously on several fronts certainly the diverse testimony we heard last summer confirmed that point but paradoxically a productivity council might help us make some progress by reminding us of that very complexityby insuring that congress does not attempt to solve our productivity problems by seizing upon on simplistic cure in my statement on productivity a year ago i outlined four general areas each encompassing several policy issues where i thought our efforts could be profitably focused first improving the use of human resources second enhancing capital formation third expanding the commercialization of advances in knowledge innovation and fourth reforming the regulatory process i can only look back over those remarks today with acute frustration if a national productivity council were monitoring congressional progress in these areas we would not receive high marks for achievement during the past year in the absence of that kind of thirdparty neutral assessment let me take my remaining time this afternoon to list some of the legislative objectives which remain unfulfilled i will not take time as i did last year to discuss these measurses relevance to productivity but i do believe each item forms a part of the puzzle"], [0.7841709554195404, 0.2158290445804596, 1, "i move to strike the requisite number of words and i rise to speak on behalf of the amendment in committee and here on the floor today we have heard a lot of good arguments about a problem that exists between the united states and its trading partners the problem is one that exists because we have tried to promote free trade in general though our colleague from new york has pointed out that our rhetoric is better than our performance and some of our trading partners have clung to advantages that we gave them in the postwar era creating clear disadvantages in many areas to expand trade of american goods abroad this is especially true in the area of agriculture and while i am totally in agreement that this problem existsand the problem has been alluded to over and overthis bill in no way addresses that problem in fact this bill will compound that problem because this bill simply says do not open up your markets to unitedstates products as we have heard over and over and over today there is no vehicle in this bill to promote the openmarket objective this bill says we are going to force you to produce a substantial amount of a significant productautomobiles motor vehiclesthat are sold on the american market in the united states it seems to me that there are several points missed and i would like to try to go through them very rapidly and make the points as clear as i can no 1 this bill will not create a single job even if no nation in the world reciprocates if no nation in the world raises its trade barriers in response there will still be no net job impact now why do i say that i say that because we are operating under flexible exchange rates the values of the dollar on the world market relative to other currencies is set by supply and demand so if we come in with a domestic content bill and we reduce the import of japanese automobiles and we havethem built here to the extent that they are produced then there will be a strengthening of the value of the dollar because we are buying less abroad but as the value of the dollar goes up the competitiveness of american goodsone out of every 6 american jobs is in exportswill decline so that for every united auto worker job that we save even if no other nation initiates a trade war responding to our first salvo there will be an american job in another industry that will be destroyed so this is not a jobcreation bill this is a jobtransfer bill and the problem is who are we taking jobs away from we are taking jobs away from industries that are growing and that are competitive and that represent the future of our nation in the 1980s and the 1990s and we are giving jobs and protecting jobs in an industry which has not stayed competitive and i am not going to say the whole fault is with management or the whole fault is with the united auto workers but the plain truth is that the american people have not been forced to buy these japanese automobiles they bought them because they were good automobiles and because they have competed and because they were given value at a given price but in tranferring jobs we still do not preserve the jobs that we save by taking other american jobs away decehaber 15 1982 what has happened to the nations that have followed this route what has happened in britain with protectionism what has happened in britain is that as they have subsidized as they have protected their heavy industry the very problems that made them noncompetitive to begin with have not been solved in fact the problems have gotten more difficult our trade problems in automobiles represent a means to a solution not the problem in and of itself it forces the unions it forces management and it forces government to change the rules of the game to make us competitive if we take away the pressure to make difficult decisions difficult decisions for presidents of labor unions difficult decisions for the president of general motors and difficult decisions for members of congress i submit that those decisions will never be made and we will be back here in 2 or 3 years with the same problems without the jobs being protected in the automobile industry but with the jobs having been destroyed in other industries we here today are speaking not just about any other nation we are talking about the policy of the worlds greatest economic power what we do is going to affect the decisions of others we cannot be the world leader and try to protect our industry from legitimate or in some cases even illegitimate competition what we need if this problem persists is a reciprocal trade bill that says to our trading partners if you are going to

against the german army in 1943 in which the jews successfully kept the ghetto out of nazi hands for months the holocaust provides a myriad of lessons for humanity these lessons should not be lost on us the unitedstates senate should promptly ratify the genocide conventionthe only international treaty that aims to prevent and punish the hideous crime of genocide we should not assume that such a crime could not occur in our day and age we have only to look to cambodia for proof nor should we assume that racism and bigotry have vanished with the nazis the forces of ignorance and hatred remain very much with us today today in remembering the holocaust its victims and its survivors we must rededicate ourselves to a vigilance so that we may never again experience the unreasoning and

mr goreand i realize there is impatience with this colloquyi talked with the gentleman from iowa i talked with the administration i talked with our minority leader and frankly i will say again that i think that this is a healthy debate we are pursuing let me just make a couple of comments and then i will stop the concept of a freeze is not necessarily new the united states actively tried to get the soviet union to agree to a freeze during salt i when the unitedstates and soviet force levels were roughly equal at that time the soviets refused to agree to a freeze they chose instead to pursue an enormous very costly arms buildup in the 1970s over the same period of time the unitedstates defense effortsas i mentioned a little earlierby any index lagged badly in the last decade according to the secretary of defense the soviet union outspent the united states by 450 billion in military investment alone the improvement that they made in their strategic weapon delivery capability now jeopardizes the survivablity of strategic systems we once thought were secure now that president reagan has proposed a strategic modernization effort to redress the deficiencies now that the soviets have had a decade of massive military buildup behind them now that they are ahead frankly in many areas of nuclear and conventional capability leonid brezhnev says that now the soviet union is prepared to accept a nuclear weapon freeze let me say i am not suggesting that the gentleman from iowa or the gentleman from new york is buying the brezhnev line sorry to even bring it up but he has suggested that a weapon freeze would be good for his country at this point i think that we must first make sure that our good intentions do not lure this country into a position of inferiority thereby precluding us ultimately from reaching the goal that the gentleman from iowa would like to see which is to reduce armaments and to bring about a more stable nuclear balance in the world i know that there are many in the united states who believe that the soviet union is genuinely interested in fair and equitable arms control agreements we have had about a decade of negotiating with them and frankly as a past congressional representative at the salt talksnot that i am an expert but i have sat in several sessions in genevai have never found a more disingenuous set of negotiators than those from the soviet union we should not gamble away the defense of the united states and the attempt by this country to prevent a nuclear war on the good intentions of the soviet union the gentleman from illinois pointed out that if we were to freeze weapon production now we would end up canceling our mx b1 trident trident d5 missile and the c31 modernization programs among others we would we perpetuating some of the vulnerabilities in our forces and conceding strategic domi nance to the soviet union all in the hope that sometime in the future they would be willing to join with us in arms reductions twenty years ago this month presi dent kennedy warned against trusting the soviet commitment to arms control saying to us we know enough now about broken negotiations by the soviet unionsecret preparations and the advantages that they gain from a long test seriesnever to offer again an uninspected moratorium it seems to me that the events in af ghanistan and poland and ethiopia and angola and soviet involvement in central america and elsewhere in the world should be telling us something about with whom we are negotiating and should instill in us a sense of cau tion as i have said in the beginning of my remarks the president wants i believe to preserve peace to insure it for the future and says that we should not just freeze the production of nuclear armswe should be reducing them i agree with him i believe that rather than freezing existing inequities we should concentrate all of our efforts in achieving strategic arms reductions to equal verifiable levels we should seek an agreement that will reduce the nuclear arsenals on both sides to equal levels in a manner that would promote stability and reduce the risk of nuclear war ind to the extent that this

subsidiary of the united nations came to an accord on intercountry european transportation of perishable foodstuffs that requires that all temperaturecontrolled railroad cars trailers and containers be inspected and certified as meeting atp standards atp is the acronym for the french title of the agreement meaning accord on transportation of perishables atp signatory nations can and o impose atp requirements on containers owned by citizens of nonsignatory countries although americanowned and operated equipment consistently exceeds the atp standards and specifications it is often subject to harassment and transportation delays simply because the united states is not a signatory of this agreement these delays could cause significant disruptions to the flow of unitedstates agricultural exports the senate by a 920 vote has already given its advice and consent to this treaty however before the state department can actually sign this treaty legislation must be enacted which would assign responsibility for administration of the treaty to the secretary of agriculture h r 6164 designates the secretary of agriculture as the properly authorized person to administer this act and

this opportunity to express my appreciation and commendation to the chairman the gentleman from illinois and the ranking minority member the gentleman from alabama for the superb work that they have done in putting togeth6r this package for the authorization bill h r 3519 department of defense authorizations for 1982 i think it represents a great deal of work careful analysis and a good job of putting this complex bill together when for the first time we have been able to authorize more in line of what this nation needs for an adequate defense posture i would like to address just one of those things that i think is terribly critical to the bill and to the defense of our country and that is the area of procurement section 909 pertaining to multiyear contracting is the result of an extensive study done by the committees panel on defense industrial base i too would like to commend my colleagues on the committee the chairman dan daniel and the ranking minority member bill whrehurst for their superb work in this particular area of this pressing problem having to do with procurement a cost effective and efficient defense program is paramount for the wellbeing of our economy and especially in times of increased defense spending multiyear procurement procedures as reported out of the armed services committee are a step in the direction of more efficient buying practices for our armed services and are therefore essential basically the committee bill calls for two changes in the procurement policy a repeal of section 810 of public law 94106 to delete the statutorily imposed cancellation ceiling of 5 million in multiyear contracts and a revision of 10 unitedstatesc 2306 g to allow multiyear contracts within the continental united states with annual 0 m appropriations current policies and procedures used by the department of defense for the procurement and development of weapons is at times a further impediment to stable r d expenditures by the unitedstates government to maintain these procedures as would be the case if the government operations committee language were accepted demonstrates to industry that the government is really not interested in altering its image of being a bad customer i am continually amazed at the way the government conducts it business affairs if the typical businessman in our country conducted his business affairs in a similar manner it would not be long before he was calling in the various provisions of the 1978 bankruptcy reform act when secretary weinberger appeared before the committee yesterday he stessed that the department of defense has placed a high priority on multiyear procurement as a stabilizing influence the object is to encourage contracts that will allow industry to do effective longrange planning r d that will lead to a stable work force and a predictable production rate industry cannot presently conduct such planning and as a result defense costs have increased substantially to quote from secretary weinbergers statement before the committee the possible savings through use of multiyear procurement are significant in recent multiyear contract awards for gau8 30mm ammunition used on the a10 aircraft and for the an alq155 power management system used on the b52 the air force was able to achieve cost savings of 34 0 million and 10 6 million respectively over singleyear acquisitions these were contracts for three years of requirements and made within existing authority the air force is considering the f16 aircraft program for multiyear contracting with anticipated savings of 560 million the navy is considering the c2a carrier onboard delivery aircraft for multiyear contracting with anticipated savings of 65 million but unless the government operations committees action is rejected on the floor of the house these savings will be lost that is almost 670 million that could be saved in just two or three examples through multiyear procurementand that is just the tip of the iceberg the multiyear language proposed by the government operations committee fails to authorize multiyear procurement the committee proposes that multiyear procurement be tested on a selective basis those contracts selected would be subject to a review and approval process on a casebycase basis and the net result is more edtape increased costs and a multiyear procurement policy that is so combersome as to be selfdefeating this year the department of defense will have about 13 million procurement transactions obligating in the neighborhood of 90 billion with contracts extending over several years if this body is serious about getting the most bang out of each taxpayers buck then it is imperative that we reject the government operations

who feel likewise to amend section 2405 out of the bill it is indeed quite possible that if this section remains in the bill in the other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree section 2405 to which i object provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military this reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances this reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons the first reason i offer is the fact that this is bad policy a serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally the same rule should apply to either one in the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the military knowing they are going to leave at a certain time most of them are preparing for that date as a matter of fact most of them use their last days of leave or they use the service training they are getting in service to prepare for when they leave there is no necessity in making a payment to these people when they are leaving their employment voluntarily which we deny private employees"]]}
