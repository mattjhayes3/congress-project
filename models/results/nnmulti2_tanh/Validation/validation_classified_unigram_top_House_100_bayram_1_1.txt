the misinformation that i believe is being given to the american people regarding the aids issue in florida today and in other parts of the country some religious organizations and other organizations are giving out information and condoms telling people that there is such a thing as safe sex the fact of the matter is that the aids virus the aids epidemic that we are facing right now in this country and around the world does not give us much latitude there is no such thing outside a monogomous relationship such as safe sex any longer any young person any married person any old person who involves themselves with another person that they do not have a lifelong experience with runs the risk of getting aids it is like playing russian roulette there has been a lot of information given out by the media by the surgeon general and others regarding the aids virus in fact the surgeon general and others have advocated the use of condoms as a step toward controlling the aids virus the fact of the matter is there is no foolproof method i said earlier today there are approximately 240 million aids viruses that can fit on a period at the end of a sentence so if you have contact with someone who has that aids virus you run the risk of getting it no matter what preventative measure you may employ i am not the only one who is saying this in fact i have gleaned the information i have from a number of sources i would like to read to you a letter that i received from dr robertson who is with the research and development corp in lexington ga he has done extensive research on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and i think everybody in america ought to know about this so that there is no misinformation o 1350 as we gain more information as time goes by it is going to be important that we take the steps that are necessary to protect the vast majority of the population from this epidemic this dread disease dr bowen the head of hhs said not long ago in a speech that tens of millions of people are going to die from aids the way it is going it could be more than that it is the worst plague to hit the world since the black plague and it may be the worst ever it is estimated right now that 4 million people in the united states alone have the virus within their systems it is doubling every 8 to 12 months which means that the attitudes of the american people do not change rapidly so next year there will be 4 to 8 million the following year there will be 8 to 16 million and the year after that there will be 16 to 32 million who are infected with the disease or who at least have the virus within their systems and so on there have been articles written saying that sometime within 12 years onefourth of the unitedstates population would have the virus within their systems and that may be conservative i would like to read this letter now it gets a little technical but i think most people if they will listen closely will glean from this letter what it really means the text of the letter is as follows dear mr burton i am writing in response to your telephone call today when you asked whether there might be a risk of transmission of the aids virus hivi other than by sexual intercourse homosexual acts the use of blood or blood products or during pregnancy and birth the answer to this question is yes the most pressing problem is that we cannot measure the risk though we can set some limits i will expand my answer in two waysfirst by telling you why one must be cautious in reaching any conclusions about the disease or its transmission and second by telling you why there is cause for concern about transmission by the nontraditional routes the most important source of information is the tabulation of aids cases reported to the centers for disease control these reports must be interpreted carefully since they represent disease diagnosed a long time after infection with hiv since there is no mechanism for collecting or reporting information about the development of antibodies to hiv or knowledge of infection and its routes is limited for example the majority of those coming down with aids male homosexuals in california drug addicts in new york come from the population first infected in this country but their proportions in the epidemic do not represent the proportions in the same groups infected now in contrast recent army data show that in some parts of new york there is an equal rate of infection amongst male and female applicants this will be reflected in aids cases reported in several years time these delays led many people to assume that aids would remain a disease exclusively a largely of homosexuals heterosexual spread of hiv in the united states has only recently been generally accepted with the publication of clear case reports although the epidemiological evidence has been strong for some time there have always been cases which could not be classifed into the known risk groups these represent a roughly constant 3 of the total when other categories of risk e g consorting with a prostitute are excluded this is not to say that these 3 acquired the virus casually but it does say that the unknown category is increasing roughly in step with the epidemic as a whole obviously there could be several explanations for this none of which can be excluded without considerable further study in particular if casual transmission were possible it would be difficult to prove without largescale prospective studies of the risks of associating with infected individuals studies to date are too small to exclude a risk though they may set limits on it indeed some appear to demonstrate a risk but again they are too small for us to be sure in this context it is important to remember that it is only recently that it has become clear that the risk of heterosexual transmission is roughly equal to the risk of homosexual transmission as is the risk of transmission from man to woman and from woman to man the early apparent differences in the risk of transmission by these routes appear to be accounted for by the delays in infection spreading to each group they are not real differences thus if transmission by nontraditional methods is either possible or likely it is only now with the virus quite widespread that we are likely to obtain good epidemiological evidence as was true for the traditional routes of transmission the first acceptable evidence of nontraditional transmission will come from case reports in which all other routes have been eliminated it is disturbing that we do in fact have several such cases reports these include transmission without sexual intercourse between an elderly couple whose only intimate contact was kissing transmission from a nursing mother to her child possibly in breast milk transmission between two young brothers by an unknown route and transmission between a patient and a neighbor who was nursing him it is likely that case reports of this kind will become more frequent as the general population becomes more heavily infected with the virus on the other hand without knowledge of the prevalence of seropositivitythat is of the number of infectious peoplein an environment it will be hard to detect transmission in say the workplace until the virus is quite prevalent as it will be in several years unless transmission is reduced now here we must for the moment rely on our theoretical knowledge of hiv and similar viruses as well as on what information we can glean from the case reports to hand hiv belongs to the family of retroviruses and the subfamily lentivlrinae the lentviruses are known to infect ungulates and primates by several routes including aerosols and even hiv has apparently spread from one chimpanzee to its cagemate without sexual contact in addition all the lentiviruses evolve rapidly so that their envelope proteins which contain the sites that recognise and blind to receptors on the cells they infect are very variable leading to the possibility of variation in infectiousness as is found in hiv as well as in specificity which might also lead to a variation in the efficiency of different routes of infection it is prudent therefore to assume that hiv can share these properties since it is extremely closely related to the other lentiviruses particularly in view of the fact that hiv can be found in most bodily secretions and excretions including urine tears and saliva as well as breast milk blood and semen hiv is also much tougher than had been thought being capable of surviving with undiminished infectiousness for at least two weeks at room temperature if damp there are therefore strong theoretical grounds for caution these grounds supply a possible february 19 1 987 basis for the transmission of the virus in those cases of nontraditional infection already reported and are cause for growing caution as the virus becomes more prevalent leading to an increasing number of contacts with infected people in the traditional modes of transmission it appears to be the case that risk per exposure is constant with infection becoming increasingly likely with an increasing number of exposures the analogy between the transmission of hepatitisb and aids has often been drawn the cdc recommend that hepatitisb precautions be taken to minimize the spread of hiv in the health care setting it seems that the routes of transmission are very similar but that the hepatitisb virus is more infectious than hiv in other words it is reasonable to expect that more cases of hiv transmission between household members will occur as prolonged exposure to hiv carriers becomes more common it will be much more difficult to detect transmission by these means outside the household without welldesigned prospective epidemlological studies the studies reported to date have been too limited to allow any conclusion other than that casual transmission is probably not easy we should remember however that this was said at first for heterosexual transmission of the virus though now we know that it is easy indeed the case reports we have are extremely strong evidence of transmission within the household and cannot be rebutted by the limited epidemlological studies of household transmission even amongst trained healthcare personnel there are cases of transmission that cannot be accounted for by riskgroup membership again all we can say is that transmission in the healthcare setting is not very likely at the moment we cannot say that it is impossible in an attachment to this letter i list the main points and give references to the most important papers copies of which are also attached my considered opinion is that transmission by contact within the family happens and that casual transmission is possible but that we have too few data to determine how efficient each casual route is some routes of transmission are not likely at all for example it does not seem possible for enough virus to be transmitted by mosquito though it is possible that other insect vectors in warm climates could play a role we simply have no direct evidence of insect transmission and what evidence we have suggests that if it plays a role at all in the tropics it is a very limited one transmission by coughing or sneezing is clearly possible in theory but does not yet seem to be likely if it were likely then we would expect to see a fillingin of the age distribution of those infected with the virus this could be happening since we have little information about the prevalence of infection by age group but if it is it has not yet affected the agedistribution of aids cases in the united states again this tells us the population at large the traditional routes are more efficient transmitters than the casual routes however i believe that there are more serious issues than the question of casual transmission one statistic illustrates this well it is likely that at least 4 million americans are infected by the virus we will not know the true number unless we perform widespread blood testing or until those infected begin to develop aids study of relatively small groups here and abroad shows that infection spreads rapidly through a population saturating it in about 58 years very roughly there is a doubling time for prevalence of infection of no more than a year if we accept this conservative estimate then there will be 4 million new infections in the united states in 1987 this is a daily rate of over 10 000 and just exceeds the annual number of live births in the united states even if only 2 million are now infected this statistic will be true in a years time if more are in fact infected now then we are already exceeding the number of live births with the number of new hiv infections since we now know that at least 50 of those infected will develop aids and then die and in fact have no reason to assume that this will not be the case for all or nearly all of those infected the situation is already extremely grave this is particularly true because what evidence we have suggests that no actions taken to date have had any measurable effect on the spread of the epidemic and because actions that are likely to be taken in the near future depend solely on changes in behavior in people who do not even know that they are infected with hiv and do not consider themselves at risk such behavioral change has not occurred in the past under these or any other circumstances without regulatory force to back it up the prognosis is therefore grim and relatively little time is left if we are to have any hope of controlling the epidemic in the united states we certainly cannot afford to wait for an hypothetical cure of the development of a vaccine

the united states and in every single appearance i have made for him on the road one or two people have come up and let me know that they have carefully tracked the record of proceedings in this house either the written record or the national technical means we are not supposed to speak of and they followed the special order that i had on the night of february 3 which i called a postmortem i even used an oxymoron in that at the beginning i did not realize i had said freedom is murdered temporarily of course when you murder something it is permanent what i meant was i had not given up hope what i should have said is it appears freedom is murdered but it is not that is a temporary situation but here we go again tomorrow i have here a document i got from the national security council i have trusted the nsc under every democratic president we had i particularly admired it under zbigniew brzezinski i did not always agree with what president carters national security advisor said but i admired him in this chamber we have people who have utter contempt not only for president reagans policies but for hi national security council but our national security council under this distinguished 4star general colin powell gave my office this document here is what it says on 10 february 19887 days after my postmortem last monththe salvadoran armed forces engaged a unit el pepeto in eastern chalatenango department killing an insurgent believed to be a courier among the documents recovered from the body of the insurgent was the document entitled strategic estimate according to this estimate during the time before the salvadoran elections and the next harvest the insurgency should make blows against vital points increase not only suburban action but urban action and generalize the war on highways in all parts of the countryin other words continue destroying the infrastructure the document actually uses a new acronym gpr which is believed to be the peoples revolutionary war and it says the gpr should fuse the political military struggle the document states that planning must be done in order to get the masses to break through legality and generate anarchy communism loves anarchy the document also assesses the insurgent view of united states policy toward central american and internal salvadoran political matters now even in an hours special order even tightening my stomach muscles and giving you all the energy i can to make you listen i cannot touch on all this so i will by unanimous consent submit it for the record later this is a 19page document in spanish taken off this dead insurgents body as cal thomas put in in one of his excellent columns in the washington times the other day it was called lesson from a corpse here are some of the things it says this is an exact translation during the next few months of the harvest and the electoral campaign a window of great political and military weakness of the army and the government will open our military plan during this time must be of an integral politicalmilitary character we must seek to give military operations a better political content and reach the capacity for destabilization in the rearguard of the enemythe enemy being of course being jos6 napole6n duarte the oneterm elected 5year president of el salvador who everybody around here pretends to love and hug so much i consider him a brave man especially in the capital and principal cities this communique goes on titled strategic estimate we need a wide strategy which combines all tactics and categories of effort we must combine the gt errilla actions of destruction with politicaleconomic destabilization by concentrating blows against vital points it goes on with an excellent analysis you would think this was written by lenin himself vladimir ilyich ulyanov lenin who died 2 or 3 months before his 54 birthday i am 54 and when i think about what that man did died january 21 1924 he was to be 54 years of age on april 22 of that year the way this lenin has influenced the history of mankind certainly the most limprotant man evil or good in a millennium of the most important influence on the course of history given the numbers of people who have died at the hands of communism far more than hitler was able to brutally murder in the 12 stinking years of his socalled thousand year reich the communist killing goes on in most of the continents of the world right at this moment listen to how well this is written as though lenin himself were guiding the pen the special forces must also operate in this way in accordance with their own characteristic including local forces clandestinity and semiclandestinity but all these forces must always maintain their bond with the masses and work toward converting the masses into the largest service and intelligence structure of our army we must understand clearly that our greatest strength lies in our level of accumulated forces and the social timebomb we can use the qpr to fuse the guerrilla military struggle with the struggle of the large numbers of masses so that the fusion with give rise to the general insurrection field comment gpr may be the peoples revolutionary war so hope springs eternal they tried to pull off this general insurrection within 10 days of president reagans inauguration back in january 1982 is that not amazing we have been trying to work this problem in central america for president reagn 7 years and almost 2 months and yet in world war ii starting from scratch with nothing barely getting the draft going we went from pearl harbor all the way to victory in europe in 3 years and 51 g months this has been double what it took to conquer hitler double what it took to wrap up japan by midaugust 1945 and we are still working this problem with my hero reagan still adhering to jimmy carters offthewall figure like the speed limit of 55 advisors in this beleaguered nation of el salvador he says the key factor with the masses is that we need to get to the point where the radical demonstrations turn into revolutionary and insurrectional actions there must be appropriate planning and lines of action which break through legality and generate a state of anarchy disobedience and social disorder and causes the masses and members to make the decision to forget about fear of death never before has there existed objective bases as strong and dynamic as those which exist now which give the opr an integral paramilitary character to advance in the widening and radicalization of the masses movement and the impositions of our con spiratorial policy in the fdp field comment other documents taken in this same capture show the expansion of fdp to be the democratic patriotic front these objective bases will present an opportunity of exceptional importance through all of 1988 and a good part of 1989 get the feeling here we are going to be voting on contra aid again and again and again in the second session of the 100th congress and in the 101st congress and thereafter until the cancer of communism is removed from managua then he goes on another couple paragraphs however the context of the document seems to imply that the third forces and possibly the other terms are references to garnering support from untraditional sources for example as the document states from within the united states it must be taken into account that other forces can do a lot to help us get to the moment most appropriate to achieve victory these include conspiratorial spaces and tendencies in the united states itself which have come about as result of the unitedstates central american policy i might add that includes slimy films out of hollywood like the one called salvador that they show in some of the communist camps throughout central and south america as a training film for how rotten the united states of america is i saw a movie on cable the other night called no way out excellent movie with this young actor who starred in silverado and the untouchables in the film inside the pentagon of course they did not get permission to shoot over there but they sure built a set that looked like it inside that pentagon and of course liberal writers love to put down homosexual and then give them all sorts of special interest treatment they have the secretary of defense who is having an affair with some young woman they have as his senior aidedecampe a homosexual who hires two guys as thugs to kill the secretary of defenses mistress girlfriend of course how are these people introduced to the movie audience and it is a big success one of the most rented videotapes in america no way out is the film they are described as agency peop a 2ia people who have just come back from central america and the young naval hero the lieutenant commander says you mean these are people who work with the death squads in el salvador and honduras and the guy nods affirmatively so here we have without batting an eye two cia agents he calls them oliver and hardy they are thugs they crash and try to kill people all through the second half of the film it is accepted in hollywood that the cia of course ran the death squads in el salvador and is now setting up death squads in honduras unbelievable so these people understand these communists in central america they have a lot of friends in hollywood then it goes on after another three excellent paragraphs i do not have time to read them all it says our conspiratorial line is by its very nature bound to dialog and negotiated political solutions but the dialog is not the only form of conspiracy it goes on to say dialog is one form of the conspiratorial struggle but we must develop other informal methods that in the moment of opportunity of power can be more or less important than official methods in other words yoko ono lennon all we are saying is give dialog a chance then it goes on to say and we must remember that flexible discussion and proposals are needed to stimulate the conspiracy another couple of valuable paragraphs that i do not have time to read and it says for revolutionary states and in the area of socialization negotiation is an expression of victory to force the united states to negotiate shows that the united states administration is politically weak and cannot mobilize all its efforts and that its policies are internationally isolated i wonder if they learned any of this from vietnam imperialists during negotiations try to make concessions on weak points and try to preserve the other points the concrete expression of this in our case is that there is united states congressional bipartisan support for el salvador but in the case of nicaragua there are deep divisions in the con gress the unity of the united states congress in relation to aid to el salvador will only be broken through strategic advance of the revolutionary movement the time of the united states elections is the most propitious moment to favor this division they are dividing us to conquer us watch the debate on the house floor tomorrow follow it in the written record esquipulas iithat is the socalled arias plan named after the president of costa rica a oneterm 4year president by the way is a concrete expression of the negotiation aspect there is in esquipulas iisometimes referred to as guatemalas most commony now as the arias plan there is in esquipulas ii for imperialism and its strategy for lowintensity conflict finally that expression of ours is making it into the communist documentscongratulations maj andy messing you finally got that expression to be understood the communists always understood it there is in esquipulas ii for inperiallsm and its strategy for lowintensity conflict an aspect which is a mortal game the defeat of the contras would be a grave strategic defeat for the united states especially if we take into account the impact of failure in vietnam and the geopolitical position of central america there is a field comment by our intelligence analysists it is clear from the text that the writer is using contras to refer to the nicaraguan resistance in other words this poor field guy hates to use the name the communists in managua tacked on to the freedom fighters dick nicaraguan resistance however if i ever need this man i will tell him that henry hyde says call them contra tyrants right up there is the seal for virginia it says so always tyrants sic sempere tyranis so let us call them contra tyrants our young freedom fighters it says the failure of the contras this is the communists writing again and the acceptance of the nicaraguan revolution for the united states can be a total global strategic change it would also affect the unitedstates counterionsurgency policy and support to the salvadoran government and right you are mr communist scholar being curried by this young courier right you are if the contras are defeated in nicaragua driven into some bataan death march toward the rio coco river in the north and the san juan river in the south to be picked up by american medical teams so some of our majority colleagues here being humanitarians would pick them tip and bring them to the united states hopefully all of them to move to fort worth and get registered 5 years from now and vote in one of your elections up there let us see what it says continuing here in spite of the bipartisan unity in the case of el salvadorvery fragile only due to this liberal democrat notre dame graduate jose durateit would be very difficult to have to recognize defeat in nicaragua in a global view it would not be politically logical for the unitedstates to take its hands out of nicaragua and place them in el salvador in the form of more military aid do not bet on it for these reasons the esquipulas ii guatemala city arlas wright reagan plan is positive for the revolution the revolutionary forces can use esquipulas ii and mr arias i add thatto divide and break down the opposition the united states can give nothing and needs to beg for everything the popular sandinista revolution has established its rules and we have our own 18 points and 6 points the united states is weak in the interest of time i jump over the next excellent paragraph and it says el salvador is a strategic pilot model for the application of lowintensity conflict methodology for the united states not only because of the geopolitical factor but also because of the characteristics of the model el salvador is a place where the united states broke the classic model of traditional military dictatorship and developed dictatorships of a new type which the united states classifies as democratic processes in other words people going to the voting booth pulling a little curtain and voting in secret they call that a new form of imperialism i jump ahead the failure of the duarte modelotherwise known as democracywould have strategic implications one thing is a revolution which triumphs over a traditional dictatorship another thing would be the fall of a christian democratic government with a reform ethic in other words they are admitting that duartes government is a christian democratic government with a reform ethic and they want to make it fail because that is an advancement for what we used to call around here

occurred last fall when the house considered the foreign assistance act during that debate this house voted overwhelmingly to limit the expansion of cargo preference by exempting the export agricultural commodities from additional cargo preference requirements when those commodities are purchased with unitedstates cash transfers to foreign countries it was the opinion of most of my farm colleagues in the house that the cargo preference issue had been again laid to rest however like a bad penny which continues to turn up so does cargo preference today i want to bring to the attention of my colleagues an example of why cargo preference is detrimental to the development of new foreign markets for unitedstates agricultural exports last month it came to my attention that the aid mission in pakistan was attempting to put together a financing package which for the first time would have enabled private sector buyers in pakistan to purchase approximately 200 000 metric tons of corn from the united states this quantity is equivalent to almost 7 400 000 bushels of corn worth over 22 million if this sale had been made it would have been the first major commercial sale of corn to pakistan and it could have opened a significant new market for united states producers the key to the sale was the financing package that would have enabled private sector buyers to consummate the purchase under aids proposal funds would have been available through private sector window of the commodity import program through the cip private sector pakistani buyers would have been able to borrow money from a cip account to purchase united states grain in turn the pakistani buyers would have marketed the corn commercially in that country all was proceeding well however until it was discovered that unitedstates cargo preference requirements applied to the ship of the corn like food assistance programs such as the public law 480 program cargo preference laws require that between 50 to 75 percent of the cargo be shipped on unitedstates flagships under current cargo preference requirements the higher cost of unitedstates flagships must be picked up by the private buyers this would have fncreased the cost of the united states corn to the point that it could not have been sold profitably in the pakistan market the end result in this case was that nobody benefited from cargo preference no united states corn was sold to pakistan unitedstates farmers lost an opportunity to gain a new foreign market and no grain moved on unitedstates ships on the surface it may seem reasonable even patriotic to require a portion of food exports which are financed with unitedstates dollars to be hauled on unitedstates ships however when we lose foreign sales when cargo preference interferes with our ability to enter new markets and when the maritime industry itself gains nothing then cargo preference requirements should either be waived or eliminated entirely under certain circumstances cargo preference requirements can be waived such as the nonavailability of ships at reasonable rates however there is currently no waiver available under our cargo preference laws that would allow marad or the department of transportation to shift the cargo preference requirement from a private sector foreign purchase of grain to a government subsidized sale to the same country this congress should seriously consider legislation that would create a spcific waiver or transfer of cargo preference requirements when that waiver or transfer would facilitate initial sales of unitedstates commodities to new foreign markets i can assure you that this member of congress and others who represent agricultural constituencies will be vigilant in opposing any further expansion of cargo preference requirements and in modifying particularly unreasonable provisions of existing law relating to cargo preference"], [1.3887882232666016e-05, 0.9999861121177673, 1, "today marks the

that congress has been forced to suspend air quality attainment deadlines in order to prevent major economic disruptions in our ciues considering these pressing problems i believe that the federal

been done in several states to explore the use of alternative motor fuels for example the general land office in my home state of texas implemented a project to use compressed natural gas in a portion of their motor vehicle fleet this project demonstrates the costeffectiveness of using compressed natural gas as a primary fuel for state vehicles with more than 5 700 state vehicles in austin alone the estimated cost savings from converting only 10 percent of this fleet would result in cost savings to the state in the range of 400 000 to 500 000 per year in addition improved air quality is another benefit of using natural gas as a vehicle fuel the most recent environmental protection agency analysis of emissions from compressed natural gas powered vehicles indicate a 50percent reduction in carbon monoxide a 40percent reduction in reactive hydrocarbons and a 100percent reduction in evaporative hydrocarbons natural gas is just one example of an economically feasible alternative motor fuel promoted in this legislation other fuels to be promoted include alcohol fuels methanol made fro coal natural gas and trash and ethanol made from corn and other agricultural products this

and freedom shared by people all over the world for more than a century the lithuanian people suffered under foreign domination trying vainly to win their independence on february 16 1918 lithuania was finally able to do just that this independence was soon followed by german occupation during world war i but thereafter and for the next 20 years until 1938 the lithuanian people were free that small nation then came under soviet domination during the course of world war ii and in 1940 lithuania was declared a constituent republic of the unitedstatess r thereafter during world war ii germany

authorization for the orphan drug grant program for 3 years fiscal years 198890 and expands the program to allow grants for the development of orphan medical devices and orphan medical foods these grants have proven to be very instrumental in the development of many orphan drugs they are awarded by the food and drug administration to independent researchers when no private pharmaceutical company will sponsor the testing and development of an orphan drug the results are then used to encourage pharmaceutical companies to sponsor the drugs the expansion of the grant program to include rphan medical devices and orphan redical foods is necessary because the lack of financial incentives deterring orphan drug work also affects these other products the bill also directs the secretary of health and human services to study whether the other provisions of the orphan drug act that encourage private company development should be available to companies working on orphan medical devices and orphan medical foods the bill also amends the orphan drug provisions in tile federal food drug and cosmetic act to assure that companies which choose to stop the production of an approved orphan drug provide notice to the fda 1 year prior to discontinuing the drug the 1year notice will give the agency the opportunity to try to secure another manufacturer so that patient care is not disrupted one provision in h r 3459 as reported by the committee on energy and commerce has been deleted from the bill before us that provision dealt with the 7year period of market exclusivity that is currently awarded to an approved orphan drug the purpose of market exclusivity is to protect the company that develops an orphan drug whose patent has expired or would expire by the time the drug can be tested and approved exclusivity assures such a company that it can offset some or all of its costs of development by recouping all possible revenues from the sale of the drug during the 7year period of exclusivity market exclusivity is intended to be an incentive to develop orphan drugs with little or no commercial value and inadequate patent protection however it can also be used to block competitors of drugs with significant commercial value due to the very high prices that are charged for them in such cases a company would seek to designate a drug as an orphan drug solely to get market exclusivity that would cut off competitors who might also seek approval of the drug in at least one case so far with human growth hormone market exclusivity has been used to block several companies that would like to sell the drug these additional companies are interested because the price of human growth homone is estimated to be 10 000 per person per year so even with this small market of 10 000 patients human growth hormone is a very successful drug in addition to human growth hormone there are several other drugs now under development where more than one sponsor is seeking approval because of the drugs perceived commercial value these commercially viableeven highly profitabledrugs fit within a strict construction of the orphan drug act but the congress never intended to extend the benefits of the act to such drugs while i believe this unintended use of the act must be stopped there is considerable disagreement over how the act should be changed because we do not want

inflexible federal regulations it does not make sense to me to discourage such contributions in this way instead we should be encouraging this outpouring of holiday spirit the problem in the current law was brought to my attention last year when the monterey peninsula herald conducted a campaign operation christmas to get subscribers to donate money to help needy families over the holidays the donors and the recipients were both justifiably outraged when they discovered that this altruism caused cuts in welfare benefits to correct the problem in the food stamp program this bill provides that up to 300 in a 3month period would be excluded from income if this amount represents nonrecurring cash donations based on need that are received from one or more private nonprofit charitable organizations cbo estimates the cost of the charity disregard to be less than 500 000 a year this bill will also correct a bureaucratic problem which has come to light in the food stamp program the food and nutrition service interprets the food stamp act as requiring that any payment which a food stamp recipient receives for providing his or her blood must be counted in determining food stamp benefits i personally think it is tragic that some people find themselves in such desperate straits that they have to sell their blood if the money they get from selling their own blood causes their food stamp benefits to be cut the inequity iscompounded at a time when there is obviously a need for blood contributions it is tragic to discourage these contributions but it is actually more tragic when a person receives payment for their contribution to have it deducted from their benefits the purpose of this provision is to correct that correction of this inequity will cost 1 million a year the third provision would authorize the department of agriculture to carry out at least one food bank demonstration project using section 32 commodities my distinguished colleague and the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on domestic marketing nutrition and consumer relations bill emerson and i held a hearing on food banks earlier this year in missouri at that hearing we received impressive testimony about the capability of food banks to meet emergency nutrition needs we came away from that hearing convinced that we should test ways to increase the flexibility of the food banks cbo advises that the cost of operating this demonstration would be 200 000 a year the cost is kept low because the department of agriculture will use commodities that are already available for donation under section 32 of the agriculture adjustment act of 1935 the house approved this demonstration earlier this year when we considered the commodity distribution reform act of 1987 h r 1340 we have included in h r 3435 the exact language already approved by the house to ensure that we have to send a vehicle over to the senate that will get this important legislation in place at the same time i want to emphasize that we are very close to getting final agreement on the few outstanding issues in h r 1340 and we hope to get that bill down to the white house before the end of the session i urge that the house approve the charitable assistance and food bank support act of 1987 h r 3435 we want to get this legislation over to the other body and work to get it enacted into law before christmas so that the good work of local charities across the country will not be undercut by the complexity of the welfare system i reserve the balance of my time"]], "top_unsure":

the president has not yet come around to that what we are debating here today is quite simple it has been distorted tremendously by the other side but it is a bilateral mutually verificable ban on the

soviet military power from the joint chiefs of staff for the first time since it has been published the soviets had moved ahead in the nuclear areas that relate to warhead technology when the joint chiefs were asked how could that happen between this year and last year when they have not tested the joint chiefs said it happened because we know if they were not testing that they must have been ahead all along now i wonder if now that they have begun testing again what next years report will look like obviously they have fallen behind again because they have begun testing the gentleman from california who led off the debate on the other side said something particularly ludicrous he said if we accept this amendment we will undermine we will undermine the efforts of our negotiators to achieve a test ban treaty that is what we are debating we are pushing a reluctant administration toward a test ban treaty that is the subject of this debate this administration does not want a test

deaf and hard of hearing are tearing down the barriers that have prevented them from becoming full and equal members of society they have removed the obstacles erected by an insensitive and unsympathetic society today this body can join these courageous individuals and discard another needless impediment to the suecess of the hearing impaired and guarantee that they have equal access to the unitedstates telephone network at present there are many times often when it matters the most that a hearing impaired person simply camot use the telephone imagine not being able to call home from a friends house or use the phone in someone elses office or even to call 911 outside your own home in an emergency for many of the nations 4 million hearing impaired persons this is not some farfetched nightmare it is a daily reality in todays information and communication driven society the telephone is no longer a luxury item it is an essential part of our everyday lives our link to the rest of the world and vital to our business and social success as well ironically since the deregulation of the telephone equipment industry which promised to bring the wonders of modern telecommunications to all americans the percentage of telephones the hearing impaired can use has gone down significantly h r 2213 will reverse this dangerous trend the bill amends section 710 of the communications act of 1934 and the telecommunications for the disabled act of 1982 to require that all telephones manufactured or imported 1 year after enactment of this act be hearing aid compatible the legislation cxempts a few specialized applications such as mobile services and phones used for national security purposes further ii r 2213 is written to insure that it will not freeze todays technology and inhibit future innovation and development the bill only requires that phones be compatible it does not mandate any particular type of technology this legislation will keep pace with the dynamic fastchanging telecommunications and hearing aid technology fortunately it is very easy to make every telephone accessible to the hearing impaired person a simple virtually costless copper wire located in the telephone hand set creates an electromagnetic field which a telecoil in a hearing aid picks up allowing the users to hear loud and clear unfortunately for the nearly 2 million telecoll hearing aid users and the up to an additional 10 million people with latent hearing impairments a very large percentage of whom among this countrys growing elderly population too many phones do not have this tiny wire we simply cannot confine the hearing impaired to a world of silence requiring that all new phones be hearing aid compatible will help the healing impaired enjoy the freedom of

with mark maccarthy of the full committee have worked intensively over a very short period of time in order to produce this piece of legislation working with the subcommittee staff in an effort to produce a bipartisan piece of legislation working together we have reached consensus language which addresses the communication needs of the hearing impaired and still affords manufacturers the flexibility which they need the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance and the full com mittee on energy and commerce unanimously adopted this consensus language as an amendment in the nature of a substitute to h r 2213 the telecommunications for the disabled act of 1982 was a good first step in improving the hearing impaireds access to a limited number of telephones but now it is time to take a giant step further a step that will ensure that the hearing impaired are capable of using every telephone like we all do a step which will guarantee the hearing impaired equal access to the unitedstates telephone system this body has often shown its commitment to a strong national policy of universal telephone service for all americans today we can again demonstrate this unwavering commitment by guaranteeing equal access of the telephone network to the hearing impaired i would also like to note although i did not do this at the appropriate time in the last legislation note that the childrens bill was also a product of that same kind of cooperation and there again the full committee staff led by mark mccarthy and the subcommittee staff of larry sidman and larry irving and liz

never see an attempt to exterminate an entire people this day provides us an opportunity to remember prior to 1914 there were over 2 million armenians living in turkey since the end of the first world war there have never been more than approximately 100 000 this is a truly staggering fact that a population could be reduced to 5 percent of its original size in the space of a few short years is almost incomprehensible the 20th century has seen horrors previously unknown and unimagined by human beings the final solution in hitlers germany the firebombing of dresden by the allies during world war ii which left that historic city looking like the surface of the moon in cambodia we still see the horrors of pol pots regime weapons have been developed and used which have destructive power that is almost beyond understanding all of these horrors have been acknowledged by the world community and all have been subjected to the shame of universal denunciation yet before any of these terrible events occurred the armenian population of turkey was reduced to onetwentieth its previous size the world community has been strangely silent on the methods through which this happened in 1908 there was a revolution in the ottoman empire and the group which would come to be known as the young turks rose to power the young turks endorsed a policy of turkish supremacy and attempted to assimilate all the various nationalities within the ottoman empire into one huge turkish people the armenian people had preserved their cultural integrity for centuries they had a tremendous sense of themselves and pride in their history needless to say they would not allow their rich cultural heritage to be stripped away armenians resisted conscription into the ottoman armies and in some cases formed armed resistance groups these groups gave the young turks the excuse they needed to systematically slaughter an entire people the turkish government began wholesale deportation and murder of armenians claiming it was necessary for reasons of national security united states ambassador morgenthau in turkey and witnessing these activities wrote that the treatment given the convoys clearly shows that

appropriate time to debate and to vote upon a constitutional amendment requiring a federal ly balanced budget as i mentioned earlier i am not talking about a law that we would pass we members of the unitedstates congress because the constitution does not allow us to do that it is not our law we can only propose to the american people a constitutional change which ultimately becomes constitutional law once in place of course we must live with it we must abide by it as members of congress but we cannot pass it out and that is the uniqueness of a constitutional law it is the peoples law they alone by threefourths of the states so ratifying can change the constitution of the united states we can only by a twothirds vote of this body and of the other body propose for ratification that change so in other words when we have a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget we here in the congress cannot change it overnight we cannot say that it is no longer appropriate we cannot live with it and we will waive the provision only the american people can make that decision and as we know on numerous occasions some 26 occasions in the history of this country have we chosen to change the constitution to either add or delete amendments changing the nature in which this government will operate changing the nature in which this congress will operate to me that is critically important not only for the members of the house but for the american public to understand so tonight we are in essence beginning a debate and a discussion that will propose to the american people a

careful way in which this bill was crafted as a member of the military construction subcommittee i rise in support of h r 4586 i will be the first to admit this is not a perfect piece of legislationthe subcommittee was not able to address all the issues and problems we wanted tobut on balance this is a good bill one of our continuing problems is that the subcommittee is not allocated the funds necessary to modernize our facilities at an efficient rate out of a total defense budget of 299 billion only 8 7 billion is going into military construction this year this is only 3 percent of the entire defense budget it is impossible to replace and renovate our military facilities at the recommended rate of 2 percent per year with such a small portion of the budget dedicated to military construction the outcome of this policy is obvious when you visit our military facilities and see socalled temporary buildings constructed during world war ii still in use among the difficult issues addressed by the subcommittee in this bill is the decline of the dollar overseas overseas construction projects become more costly as the dollar drops in relation to the currency of the host country this problem hurts the army in particular because of their extensive construction projects in germany the pentagon did not request funds to meet this shortfall instead they chose to take funds from domestic projects this was not acceptable to the subcommittee and we provided 99 million to help meet the shortfall we specifically earmarked money for the individual services with the army receiving a larger portion to meet their greater need the military construction subcommittee also grapples with the highvisibility issue of burdensharingencouraging our allies to pay a larger portion of the cost of nato in this bill the subcommittee has reduced funding by almost 25 million for several projects to show our belief that there should be greater burdensharing by our allies and to encourage their greater participation this bill gives a high priority to the pentagons revitalization program for the services these are costly initiatives involving the socalled bedding down of new weapons systems for the navy and the air force and the light infantry division for the army all of these projects are being accommodated while we continue to attempt to modernize the basic infrastructure of the militarythe roads sewer systems and housing tracts i am concerned as i look at the future of our military construction program i am concerned because this body has not reached a consensus on how we will handle the most important issues facing us we must decide how we will handle the politically sensitive issue of base closing we build new bases with new missions to meet new threatsand yet we havent closed a single base since 1977 surely some of these bases have outlived their purpose we must settle the issue of davisbacon act regulations governing the wages paid on federal construction projects when resources are so limited and the needs so acute it is nothing short of tragic that we continue to impose outmoded expensive and wasteful construction practices on our own projects we could build at least 500 additional desperately needed housing units if we would relax the davisbacon requirement for residential housing construction only last we must come to grips with the results of the allvolunteer force more and more of the young people coming into the service are married and have a child sometimes more we must deal with the current housing crisis on our military bases we must protect young enlisted people with very little money from being forced on the local economy for housing we have bases in some of the most expensive housing markets in the countrysan diego virginia beach san francisco new york city and of course washington dc we must find a way to build adequate numbers of comfortable housing to deal with the increase of married people in the enlisted ranks we must also deal with other quality of life issuesdecent day care reduced time away from home for the service member less frequent moves to new bases greater support for the

democracy is coming up for reauthorization very shortly the four core grantees i would remind my colleagues consist of the aflcio the international democrat and republican institute respectively and the chamber of commerce they are very complicatedsounding names which all leads to the reality that the national endowment for democracy whatever it is is operating globally in over 70 countries in the world and its potential for good is far outweighed by the actual record that they have compiled over the last several years we are now going to evaluate whether there is a political and budgetary justification to continue the national endowment for democracy whether on grounds of political and fiscal pragmatism this organization makes sense the national endowment for democracy in some circles is referred to as the taxpayers funding for foreign elections act in other words it allows at taxpayer expense for the united states through these organizations within the national endowment for democracy to meddle in other peoples foreign elections and it has meddled in several foreign elections to our disadvantage it continues to engage in political advocacy frequently embarrassing this government and the state department in the process it is an indefensible use of the taxpayers money and is even more so in this era of grammrudmanhollings of course the national endowment for democracy maintains that its activities are necessary to promote democratic institutions and that it does not interfere with the political activities in other countries in which they are guests but it has already secretly supported a political organization in france one of the worlds oldest democracies by actively opposing there the governing party of president mitterrand president mitterrand was not informed that the united states taxpayers had funded his political opponents group and that the group had publicized ties to at least one outlawed terrorist organization in another extraordinary activity the national endowment for democracy was funding an organization advocating support of contra funding in american newspaper advertisements taxpayer money used to advise the members of the house of representatives how to vote on a contra aid bill advocating a procontra position opposed overwhelmingly by a majority of americans for the last several years what a lesson in the ideals of democracy the organization known as prodemca argued that none of the moneys went to the advertisements but the arguments were unconvincing funds are fungible as we all know and its as simple as that prodemca also used national endowment moneys to fund the nicaraguan opposition newspaper la prensa in nicaragua in other words here again we are directly intervening into a political dispute with counterproductive results in terms of promoting democratic reform this time it is in a wartorn land over which there is so much debate in this country neds activities certainly did not enhance free speech in nicaragua rather the publicized national endowment for democracy connection and the ineptitude with which it was administered gave the nicaraguan government the excuse that it sorely needed to close the opposition newspaper so democracy lost there it suffered a serious blow at the hands of the endowment other national endowment for democracy activities have included the support of a militarybacked candidate in panama in the presidential election the closest one ever yes you heard me correctly the national endowment for democracy federally funded was involved in supporting a militarybacked candidate in 1984 in the nation of panama provoking protests from the american ambassador in panama ned also supports the adn party in bolivia it supports the conservative party in colombia it has operations in democracies like portugal it has political action committees in el salvador and a wide range of international organizations with very ideological and political agendas the publication of the relationship of the national endowment for democracy and organizations it funds has been to put it mildly very embarrassing over the last several years the gao finding that the national endowment for democracy has been funding the national political party institutes in violation of congressional law was disturbing and shocking to a number of congressional members of both political parties in this country as was the revelation that the national endowment appeared to support in the philippines a labor union created by the former dictator there the deposed president ferdinand marcos the list of travesties goes on and on all activities being carried on to support democratic transitions to open closed societies covers the nature of the activities that this money is being used for federal money taxpayers money ninety percent of the national endowment funds incredibly go to organizations who are represented by members of the board in other words it is a highly incestuous relationshipmore democractic idealism the people on the board give the money to each of the organizations that they are related to is this necessary even assuming that these purposes are worthy the fact of the matter is it is not because private citizens donate far more than is federally given to ned for many purposes of promoting democracy that are far less controversial private citizens have spent over 1 5 billion last year through various public and private organizations to promote democracy in organizations around the world which is a perfectly valid right an activity to be encouraged and within the scope of this law provided there is no military support in any way but what we have here is incredible meddling and politicizing through an organization funded through the taxpayers that further brings into question the constitution and its provisions governing administration of american foreign policy how and why it came into being is a matter for future consideration the national endowment of democracy has appealing euphemisms for meddling when they move into foreign countries countries are in crisis like france for instance or they are trying to sustain democratic possibilities in portugal for example or they are supporting democratic transitions in panama maybe they are attempting to strengthen these new democracies they are encouraging workers to be in labor unions the list of descriptions all flattering and supportable on their face goes on and on but the truth is that they are really foreign political intervention paid for by our taxpayers without appropriate congressional oversight and just as frequently without serious congressional approval to me the national endowment for democracy is suspect and questionh 2 037 2 congressional recorttj z ori19 able exactly because they have funded organizations like prodemca friends of the democratic center in central america which is one of marine colonel norths conduits to the contras founded by contra leader arturo cruz and penn kemble prodemca is also funded by carl channells national endowment for the preservation of liberty one of oliver norths fundraising organizations for the contras mr kemble and his sister eugenia who runs the free trade union institute the afilcios national endowment grantee organization were amount the early supporters of project democracy another operation officially launched by president reagans national security directive numbered 77 that led directly to the national security councils covert activities that have frequently proved illegal in both iran and nicaragua in other words so much has happened since the last time that the house funded the national endowment for democracy that we will now have to very carefully go through the relationship of many of these support organizations arms cover organizations conduits for organizations funded by the national endowment for democracy this is a whole new ball game to that end i have accepted the invitation of the chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee on the foreign affairs committee the honorable dan mica to meet with him to see if we can sort out some of these activities and see if he is going to continue his commitment to come down hard on ned if they have violated their charter those were the assurances that i got after last years vote still new revelations have been discovered since then and so i look forward to meeting with the chairman of the subcommittee who has this jurisdiction now the amendment that i offered last year to abolish the national endowment for democracy received a very healthy vote it carried before in fiscal year 1985 at that time the issue was the intervention of the national endowment for democracy in foreign election processes in panama and other activities involving political parties and their affiliated organizations its relationship to the adn party in bolivia the conservative party in colombia the center for political studies in guatemala and others have all been also questioned the issue is still the unitedstates governments foreign policy being made and implemented by the national endowment for democracy its surrogates its overt and covert funding grantees and recipients of funds through a number of networks and mechanisms and the irancontra scandal should remind us of the danger of that and the scope of the national endowment for democracys foreign activities is much broader than tampering in foreign elections this is the fourth year of its operation and as far as i can tell from the information that has come to my attention it has been 4 years too long the national endowment for democracys mission characterized once by president reagan as being bold and difficult in reality should be classified as illegal and prone to misadventures and mischief with the inevitable embarrassing international repercussions that have occurred i am confident that the members of the house
