with disasters we come together in recognition of our shared values from world war ii to 9 11 to hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and

the aisle was to do no budget at all the democrats failed in perhaps their most basic responsibility now continuing in this line of inaction the president gave a speech yesterday with much preceding hype but again the defining aspect of the speech was no plan our rudderless president decided to take the two biggest drivers of our national debt medicare and social security and take them off the table his solution to addressing health care costs is further empowering the independent payment advisory board to ration health care instead of dealing with structural reforms what this all means is that we have a stark choice a choice of two futures one future is the presidents plan the one in red here the plan by the house democrats thats a path to national bankruptcy the other choice is a path to prosperity the green that gets us on a path to a balanced budget its time to address the american people in an honest and a factual manner lets face it the american people are sick and tired of

away choices from patients and doctors while saddling workers and job creators and taxpayers with trillions of dollars in costs so we completely repeal and defund obamacare further we will save and preserve medicare for future generations by providing commonsense solutions so that folks have essentially the same kinds of health care choices that members of congress have its imperative that people recognize that no changes are made that would affect those in or near retirement now many folks on the other side of the aisle would rather bury their heads in the sand and ignore the reforms that need to be made to medicare the president has even decided to take it off the table but the facts are that the current medicare spending is growing at a rate twice as fast as the nations economy

because this resolution is not a serious legislative effort it is a series of talking points it is a press release what this resolution does is ask the committees of jurisdiction to hopefully maybe someday if they would be so kind to report legislation to the house that meets certain vague goals instead of repeal and replace this is repeal and relax trust the republicans to do the right thing no thank you yesterday this house voted without a single hearing or markup without a single amendment to eliminate the affordable care act in its entirety the members who voted for that bill voted to return to the days when insurance companies could discriminate against people based upon preexisting conditions they voted to eliminate the ban on annual and lifetime limits on care they voted to eliminate the ability for young people to stay on their parents insurance plans up to the age of 26 they voted to reopen the doughnut hole in medicare basically they voted for a tax increase on senior citizens who need prescription drugs they voted to eliminate tax credits for small businesses who want to do the right thing and provide health insurance for their workers all of that would have the force of law all of that was done with real legislative language but not the resolution before us today instead of real language that would provide real benefits to real americans this resolution is simply a collection of empty promises and the ironic thing is that most of the provisions included in the resolution were actually addressed in the affordable care act according to this resolution we should quote lower health care premiums through increased competition and choice well the affordable care act already does that of course many of us argued for a public option which would have lowered premiums even further with increased competition and choice but my republican friends didnt want to have anything to do with that the resolution before us today says we should preserve a patients ability to keep his or her health plan if he or she likes it well the affordable care act already does that increase the number of insured americans well we did that by 30 million people protect the doctorpatient relationship we did that and so on and so on on the critical issue of people with preexisting conditions however its interesting to see the language that my republican friends use in this press release that they call a resolution they say they support and i quote provide people with preexisting conditions access to affordable health coverage well that sounds nice but what we did in the affordable care act was to actually ban insurance companies from discriminating against those people i will be very interested to see how my republican friends handle that critical issue and how much influence the big insurance lobby has around here now that theyre in charge and the doughnut hole the resolution is absolutely silent on the doughnut hole health care is of vital importance

create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other

to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents

add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass

mean i have almost memorized the one sentence it says that we need to make sure that the budget committee and the appropriations committee work to get us to 2008 spending levels or less i personally believe that we should be substantially below 2008 levels i believe that we need to take that kind of action and its true before the president stands right over my shoulder at 9 oclock this evening and delivers his state of the union message we want this institution to have a chance to go on record saying that we are committed to doing everything that we can to get the spending levels to 2008 or less now we are in the position we are and that itself is unprecedented and thats why unprecedented action is necessary now i began my remarks by talking about the fact that probably one of the most enduring and powerful memories of 2010 was what took place in athens greece we saw the riots take place in the streets from public service employees in the wake of the government facing the responsibility of imposing austerity standards on the people of greece and what happened we saw this huge outcry come because they were arguing that they couldnt in fact bring about cuts in spending i juxtapose that to what we saw in the last year here we saw tens of thousands of americans taking to the streets carrying this message taxed enough already they came together to petition their government to bring about spending reductions not complaining that the government was making cuts complaining that the government wasnt making enough cuts and thats exactly what were doing in fact i believe that this may be the first time in human history that we have witnessed what it was that we saw take place last year and led to the outcome in the november 2 election we know that the greatest change in threequarters of a century took place in this institution sixtythree members of the democratic party were defeated we now have 87 new republicans and nine new democrats who have joined with us and they have carried this message to us that we need to rein in spending now i think its important to note that our real goal is above that it is job creation and economic growth getting our economy back on track so that people out there who are trying to get onto the first rung of the economic ladder are able do just that we have a painfully high unemployment rate and people across this country are hurting now what steps can we take to create jobs i personally believe that we need toand i look forward to having the president talk about this tonightopen up new markets around the world so that union and nonunion workers in the united states of america can have the opportunity to sell goods and provide services into countries like colombia and panama and south korea where these pending agreements exist i believe that since japan has brought about a reduction in its top corporate rate the rate of those job creators we can reduce the top corporate rateits the highest rate of any country in the world nowfrom 35 to 25 percent i understand the president may be proposing that this evening that will go a long way towards creating jobs but what were doing with h res 38 is we are getting ourselves on a path towards fiscal responsibility and i believe that that is one of the most important things that we can do as we seek this shared goal of job creation and economic growth so if we can let this institution go on record in support of getting to 2008 levels or less i am convinced that that will be a strong step towards our goal our shared goal of creating jobs and establishing economic growth this is the beginning of a process the beginning of a process again a onesentence resolution that this house will be voting on in just a few minutes but the process itself is one that is broken its broken because for the first time since the 1974 budget act was put into place weve not had a budget weve not had a budget were almost 5 months into the new fiscal year and we are in the process of cleaning up the mess that was handed to us so how is it we plan to do it well speaker boehner has made it very clear and that is that we need to make sure that we have an open freeflowing debate as we proceed with a budget and im convinced that our rules committee will make alternatives in order when we proceed with the work that the budget committee will have done and im convinced that we will get back to the kind of regular order that i think today democrats and republicans alike would want to see and that is a chance for democrats and republicans to stand up and offer amendments to the appropriations bills so i will say again that its a simple onesentence resolution are we going to let this institution get onto a path towards reducing the size scope reach and control of the federal government or are we not and so i am going to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this very very important resolution"], [0.9733741283416748, 0.026625871658325195, 1, "i am

a map of arizona and the portions of arizona where i was were in the southeastern portion of arizona over here everybody has heard of tombstone but i was a little further south than tombstone all the way to the border and douglas arizona which is in the corner the southwestern corner of arizona and next to new mexico and along that portion of the southern border of the united states visiting primarily with the people that were in charge of border security the border patrol and the ranchers who live along the border let me talk about the ranchers first one of those ranchers mr krentz a year ago was murdered on his ranch apparently by illegals coming into the united states he was gunned down and killed the culprits that committed that crime by the way have not been brought to justice i met with other ranchers in the entire region and just asked them the question tell me what its like to live on the border of the united states and mexico as a ranch owner and they went on forever and forever and told me things that i was just really somewhat surprised about how they feel like the border is wide open that people cross across their ranches people come in they destroy their property they destroy their water lines all of this costs money to the ranchers and of course they have to be the ones that pick up the bill for the destruction on their property and they dont feel safe about the people that cross into the united states across their land they feel like the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has jurisdiction that includes arizona but goes up to the new mexico border and so when illegals cross into the united states near new mexico or arizona some of them ask the question am i in the 9th court which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first obligationto protect americans and thats just the way it is"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0004048943519592285, 0.5004048943519592, 0, "thank you this past week or so ago we had the ncos of all the services come in to appear before the milcon subcommittee the

7 billionthats billion with a b they were sailing high on taxpayer dollars while other americans were struggling to stay afloat when they were arrested the coconspirators had their sights set on a 780 million corps of engineers contract fortunately they were apprehended before this very large contract was awarded similarly in august of this year a federal court grand jury in norfolk virginia indicted four coconspirators of multiple alleged criminal charges including conspiracy theft of public money wire fraud illegal gratuities false statements and money laundering in connection with a kickback scheme involving coast guard vessel repair contracts this august 2011 kickback scheme is particularly striking because of the coast guards spectacular contract failures in recent history under the deepwater program we all may recall that under deepwater the coast guards most infamous failure was the effort to lengthen the coast guards existing 110foot patrol boats to 123 feet and install new upgraded information technology equipment after eight boats were delivered the coast guard determined that the lengthened hulls cracked and were unsafe we simply cannot afford to allow one more dollar of our limited federal resourcesof the taxpayers limited resourcesto be wasted we can help root out these crony kickbacks with this final and straightforward amendment this is a plain and simple vote to eliminate fraud waste and abuse when you hear about contractors who engage in the largest corruption scheme in modern history like those in the army corps its clear they need to be put in the penalty box this final amendment simply says that contractors who rip off taxpayers cant get more contracts specifically it prohibits the coast guard and the corps of engineers from awarding a contract to a contractor convicted of fraud or a criminal offense related to obtaining a contract or subcontract with the federal government it also prohibits a contract for a contractor convicted of embezzlement theft forgery bribery falsification or destruction of records making false statements tax evasion violating federal criminal tax laws or receiving stolen property from participating this final amendment ensures that felons convicted of criminal offenses related to receiving government contracts and abusing the public trust will no longer stand to benefit from future federal contracts for at least 10 years this amendment will not kill the bill it will simply immediately add this taxpayer safeguard and then the house will vote on final passage of the bill right here and right now so i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this final amendment which will ensure that we bust waste fraud and abuse and throw those kickback cronies into the penalty box
