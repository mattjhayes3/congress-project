leadership is bringing before the house today is reckless thoughtless and heartless and most disturbingly its a jobs killer i believe that the best way to reduce our deficit and longterm debt is to grow our economy to help businesses create jobs at a time when our economy is emerging from the worst recession in our lifetimes when millions of americans are out of work and millions more are struggling to make ends meet this continuing resolution takes exactly the wrong approach instead of making needed investments in education medical research infrastructure and other priorities this bill takes a meat axe to them instead of strengthening the middle class on main street this bill gives sweetheart deals for wall street instead of investing in our workers it protects special interest subsidies for big oil companies and hedge fund managers a few weeks ago on this floor republicans told us that veterans programs education child nutrition and health care research would be protected it is clear now that those were empty promises for veterans the bill eliminates a program that offers housing vouchers for homeless veterans in education the bill decimates the pell grant program by reducing the maximum award by 800 and by cutting another 4 9 billion from other education programs for child nutrition the bill cuts 750 million from the women infants and childrens program and the bill slashes 2 5 billion from the national institutes of health jeopardizing important research into diseases like cancer and alzheimers and diabetes it destroys the land and water conservation fund a commonsense program to preserve and protect our natural resources and outdoor recreational space helping local economies grow when we brought up the prospect of these cuts a few weeks ago we were accused of demonizing the debate now that we have seen the numbers before us i am sad to say it is worse than any of us could have predicted i find the cuts in education funding to be particularly troublesome as president obama made clear in his state of the union we must invest in our children if we are to compete in the 21st century economy in order to maintain our economic standing in order to create the jobs of the future in order to compete against china we must have a welleducated workforce so why on earth would we slash pell grants which help millions of families 12 000 in my district alone pay for college we shouldnt this bill will also decimate important lifesaving food aid programs to feed hungry children and refugees it would literally take the food out of the mouths of some of the most vulnerable people around the world retreating from the global war against extreme poverty and hunger will undermine not just our moral authority but our national security as well i also want to point out that this bill continues the same misguided policy under republican and democratic presidents alike that borrows hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for the wars in iraq and afghanistan if we are truly serious about reducing the deficit then those wars need to be ended or paid for along with my colleagues like walter jones and others im going to continue to talk about this issue these wars are bankrupting us and we need to have a meaningful thorough debate about them so again i believe this continuing resolution contains exactly the wrong prescription for our nation we should be focusing on creating jobs and growing our economy instead this republican bill would lead to more unemployment more unfairness and more hardship with the american people i urge my colleagues to reject this rule and reject this underlying bill"], [0.00031304359436035156, 0.9996869564056396, 1, "the republican budget proposal pulls a bait and switch on seniors people with

exception for regulations that attempt to manipulate the price of oil gas and other fuels as i was listening to my colleague from across the aisle i was struck by the fact that he didnt actually mention any possible regulations that could do that i also would like to point out that our hands as congress are not tied this bill ties the hands of regulators if he is able to come up with a good idea to lower fuel prices he can bring it to congress we can pass it the senate can pass it and the president can sign it just the way the founding fathers intended just to be clear i also want to point out that nothing in h r 4078 prevents the administration from taking any number of actions that would increase the supply of domestic oil and gas and lower the price of gasoline at the pump the passage of this amendment however would do nothing to lower the price at the pump now i realize this amendment seems to preserve the option to impose price controls thats the only thing i could think of that it could do we learned back in the 1970s that price control does nothing but lead to shortage and lines at the gasoline pump theres absolutely no reason we need to return to the failed policies of the carter administration now if the current administration were truly interested in providing relief at the pump there are any number of actions they could do to increase the supply of oil and gasoline and lower the price at the pump but the obama administrations done little to tap into vast domestic resources that would increase the supply of american oil rather under president obama permitting and leasing on federal land is actually down alas the president has also vetoed or is opposed to the keystone pipeline which would have connected not only canadian oil to refineries in the south but would have also have connected the new finds in north dakota in the bakken shale sands canadian sands production is expected to double to 3 million barrels a day between 2010 and 2020 and domestic oil production will increase by as much as 20 percent the lack of a keystone xllike pipeline means slower less reliable and less safe forms of transportation that will continue to necessitate transporting domestic oil from north dakota by much more expensive and much less safe means of truck and rail rather than pipelines lowering the cost of that transportation would lower the cost of that crude oil and would lower the cost of gasoline at the pump as a matter of fact a barrel of north dakota sweet sells for 62 thats lower than the international price of oil predominantly because of the additional transportation costs necessary to bring it down to be refined in the refineries that are currently set up in this country if this bakken oil were made available to the rest of the country we would see an economic boom we would see lower prices for gasoline at the pump we would see more jobs in america the east coast in particular needs this oil and this gas made available to bring costs down bakken may lead to some price relief there but it will also open canadian oil we talk about energy independence but realistically north america is the energy unit that we should be looking at for providing our source as we tap resources throughout the united states canada and mexico we are going to be able to become energy independent much more rapidly than anyone ever thought as these new technologies develop to let us reach oil and gas deposits that we never even 10 years ago thought was possible i was talking to a geologist just recently when i attended a field hearing in north dakota and he told me when he was in school they always considered shale to be the source and would never be able to tap it but technology has proved that wrong and in fact even with our current technology were only getting a small percentage of the actual oil trapped in that shale im confident that as our technology develops that is going to become more and more available and this is going to take care of it but what we know is whats running up the price of oil and gas is excessive government regulation and if we can put a hold on government regulation so our businesses can know what they have to do to comply with those regulations and not have the goalposts moved in the middle of the game well have new refining infrastructure built well have new factories built well

aware that today we owe well over 15 trillion in national debt this year alone were going to borrow 1 3 trillion on top of a trillion dollars last year and the year before that there are trilliondollar deficits as far as the eye can see last year the house republicans put forward a budget that showed a path to balance telling the american people how we balanced the american budget at some point in the future now last year and this year the president put out a budget neither of which were ever balanced never telling the american people what his plan is to bring american spending to balance with its revenues so we look a couple years back when the president and this house passed the affordable care act or obamacare which the cbo now states that over 10 years the rosiest of projections say its going to cost the country nearly 2 trillion more even when they put out that budget or that proposal for health care reform theyre still not willing to put out a budget that says how were going to pay for it that concerns me im a father of six were spending today and passing the bill off to the next generation its unconscionable lets actually talk about what the president and

part of the country instead of your family your health care provider or you making that decision listen im from wisconsin and i know the values that we have in central wisconsin theyre probably a little bit different in arkansas or kansas or kentucky minnesota or michigan i think we should allow people to make their health care decisions instead of bureaucrats in washington but what concerns me the most is how obamacare impacts medicare now listen obamacare takes a half a trillion dollars out of medicare and uses it to fund obamacare now we all know in america that we have some financial pressures on medicare we know that we have to come together as a country as a community both parties to figure out how were going to pay for medicare keep the promise to our seniors at a time when were still having that debate to think that this house would pass a bill and take a half a trillion dollars out of medicare and use it for obamacare i think thats wrong lets first figure out how we keep the promise to our seniors before you make a promise to anyone else with their money that is unconscionable what concerns me the most is what the gentleman from arkansas mentioned which is the independent payment advisory board its the ipab and we havent heard a lot about it but i think youll hear a lot more as the months go on this is a board of 15 unelected bureaucrats what theyre going to do is look at reimbursement rates with medicare and they are going to be able to systematically reduce reimbursements to doctors hospitals and clinics for the care for our seniors lets make no mistake this is reimbursements for our current seniors not for some future generation the argument by the president goes like this mr and mrs senior dont you worry about your quality of care or your access to care were just going to pay your doctor your hospital and your clinic less for your care if you believe that ive got oceanfront land for you in arizona of course its going to affect our seniors access and quality of care when you pay less for it youre going to get less of it our seniors they worked a lifetime they bargained they retired based on this promise for medicare this proposal doesnt meet that obligation it takes a half a trillion dollars from medicare but then is going to ration the care of our current seniorsseniors who cant go back into the workforce and get

an increase of about 40 cents from a year ago and about 20 cents from just 1 month ago citizens are suffering and they need relief it is important to point out in this context that when president obama took office gas prices were at about 1 85 per gallon now that they are up to about 3 75 per gallon we can see a steady increase over this 38month period of time of his presidency so far gasoline prices have risen an average of about 5 cents per gallon per month this is staggering when we think about the fact that if he is reelectedif he serves out the rest of this term and if he is reelectedthat is a total of an additional 58 months with that increase gas prices will be up at around 6 60 per gallon this is a lot of money it is staggering it affects everything we dofrom the miles we drive to the products we buy at the grocery store everything gets more expensive when the fuel we use to transport ourselves and our products becomes more expensive now to some extent one could suggest this was not only foreseeable but it was actually foreseen to some it was considered a desired outcome lets consider for example that in 2008 dr steven chu who now serves as president obamas energy secretary said somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in europe well mr chu it looks as though we are headed in that direction and if we continue to follow this administrations energy policies we may get there as a member of the senates energy and natural resources committee i was somewhat surprised when a suggestion was made just a few days ago that there are some who believe there is no relationship between unitedstates production of petroleum and the price of gasoline in the united states that simply is not true and it cannot be true with oil being the input ingredient into gasoline it is the precursor for gasoline anytime we do anything that cuts off or restricts or limits the supply that is necessarily going to have an impact on the price and it does the fact that it is indisputable that there are other factors which also influence the price of gasoline makes it no less true that we have to produce petroleum at home in addition to buying it from other places in order to keep gasoline prices at reasonable levels we have to produce more there are some things we can do in order to help improve that trend for example we could open anwr for drilling we could open our countrys vast federal public lands to development of oil shale it is a little known fact that in three rocky mountain states a small segment of rocky mountain statesutah colorado and wyomingwe have an estimated 1 2 trillion barrels of proven recoverable oil reserves locked up in oil shale now 1 2 trillion barrels is a lot of oil that is comparable to the combined petroleum reserves of the top 10 petroleumproducing countries of the world combinedjust in one segment of three rocky mountain states yet we are not producing it commercially in part to a very significant degree because that oil shaleespecially in my state the state of utahis overwhelmingly on federal public land and it is almost impossible to get to it to produce it commercially on federally owned public land we need to change that we need to create a sensible environmental review process for oil and gas production generally we need to improve the permitting process for offshore development in the gulf of mexico and in other areas we need to allow the states to regulate hydraulic fracturing without the fear of suffocating and duplicative federal regulations we need to keep

of terror attacks masterminded and carried out by hezbollah throughout the world from the suicide truck bombings of the unitedstates embassy in beirut in april 1983 that killed 63 the unitedstates marine barracks bombing in october 1983 that killed 241 american military personnel a separate attack on the french military compound that killed 58 as well as the hijacking of twa 847 in 1995 and

its fy13 budget proposal that the dhs acknowledges will cost over 1 billion to construct that the national academy of sciences has raised real concerns about the possibility of foot and mouth disease release and that many in the agricultural community are asking why take the chance when the national academy of sciences last reviewed the nbaf proposal they indicated that the risk of foot and mouth disease in the nations heartland was a 70 percent risk over a 50year period the academy also estimated the cost of a potential release of foot and mouth disease at 9 billion to 50 billion while it is correct that earlier this year dhs indicated this risk had been mitigated with additional design features the national academy of sciences is still revising the revised risk assessment common sense requires that until the revised risk assessment is complete we should not be entertaining the idea of appropriating precious taxpayer dollars for construction of this project nbaf has also become a financial boondoggle the estimated cost of construction has skyrocketed from an original estimate of 451 million only a few years ago to well over 1 billion today at this time it is a colossal risk to the american taxpayer to advance a project the cost of which has doubled in less than 5 years and when funding for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 remain unobligated at a time when my republican colleagues continually argue that our nations debt is out of control and the deficit must be reined in it is both hypocritical and unwise to spend taxpayer dollars that the president has not requested for a project that is still under design review to be placed in a region that is acutely sensitive to the horrible diseases that will be studied at the facility the only logical responsible thing to do while the many questions surrounding nbaf remain unanswered is to wait to invest taxpayers hardearned money and continue to utilize existing dhs assets to study the various animal diseases that face

that sanctions and in fact all diplomacy are most effective when they are multilateralthe more multilateral the better we are particularly strong in such matters when we and our friends and allies in the european union stand shoulder to shoulder thats why europes seemingly inexplicable refusal to classify hezbollah as a terrorist group has been so disappointing over the years hezbollah is a charter member of the foreign terrorist organizations list in the united states its crimes are legion spread over many continents and far too numerous to list here they begin in the early 1980s with deadly bombings of the unitedstates embassy and the unitedstates marine and french army barracks in beirut and they have continued up to the present day i still remember ronald reagan president reagan talking about it after so many of our marines were murdered in lebanon let me mention just a few of the other lowlights countless kidnappings of americans and europeans in the 1980s and 1990s the khobar towers attack that killed 19 americans in 1996 the 1992 bombing of the israeli embassy and the 1994 bombing of the jewish community center in buenos aires again with multiple killings the murders of americans in iraq and the training of other iraqi militants and countless assassinations in lebanon including most likely that of former prime minister rafik hariri in 2005 in 2006 hezbollahs unprovoked murder of three israeli soldiers caused a war during which hezbollah rocketed civilian targets in lebanon and used lebanese civilian as human shields over the past 2 years it has staged attacks from turkey to thailand today it has forces in syria fighting on behalf of assad and the murderous assad regime and helping to train assads thugs in addition this year hezbollah twice has been directly implicated in terrorism on european union territoryin bulgaria where a suicide bomber killed five israeli tourists and a bulgarian and in cyprus where an apparent hezbollah terrorist attack was thwarted the failure of most european nations to designate hezbollah has been based on the flimsiest of reasons namely that hezbollah provides social services to the shiite community and participates in electoral politics in lebanon in fact hezbollah takes a very novel approach to electoral politicsusing a militia to intimidate voters into voting for them by the way its a lesson that hamas has learned very very well but europes failure to designate hezbollah as a terrorist group is not merely a problem because it accords legitimacy to a terrorist organization rather it has important operational consequences as well the failure to designate makes it more difficult to prosecute cases against hezbollah crimes committed in europe it allows hezbollah to use eu territories to fundraise recruit new members propagandize and train and thus the freedom hezbollah enjoys in europe ultimately affects noneuropeans as well the european union obviously will make its own decisions on this matter but its hard to escape the conclusion that the eus failure to designate hezbollah undermines both europes security and ours as well the state departments top counterterrorism official recently said that hes cautiously optimisticat lastabout the prospects for an eu designation of the group i hope his optimism is justified until it is borne out with an actual terrorist designation

also have an exclusive license for limited laboratories to administer the test like genetic tests for colon cancer parkinsons disease alzheimers disease stroke and many other genetic disorders there is no way to get a truly independent second opinion in approximately 20 percent of all genetic tests only one laboratory can perform the test due to patent exclusivity for the diagnostic testing and often the actual human gene being tested just imagine your genes hold the key to your survival having major bodyaltering surgery or treatment could save you life but the test results fail to give you

a proposal to give working middle class taxpayers a reduction in the amount they pay into social security but we backfilled that money so that social securitys trust fund was not depleted and we said

depending upon the items at issue here so well meet again tomorrow at 10 oclock is my understanding in conference either in private or in public i dont know that will be up to the chairman but in any case i dont care when or where im ready mr reed from new york who spoke earlier is ready and my other conferees are ready we were ready in december to get this done we really were and we still are and were committed to the working american people and those who are trying and struggling to find jobs to make sure they have that unemployment insurance they deserve that they need that and were committed to providing that so on that note i dont think there will be any objection on this floor to approving the motion to instruct conferees to get their work done by the 17th ill certainly support it as i have and nearly everyone in the house has i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0025485754013061523, 0.49745142459869385, 1, "the reality behind the fiscal cliff is that if we really get down to work talking with one another digging into the details it really is not that hard the nuclear arsenal is a prime example and something that doesnt get nearly the attention it deserves it is an illustration of why the fiscal sequestration level over the next 10 years for the department of defense which would bring it down to 2007 spending levels adjusted for inflation is really not that draconian during the cold war the united states spent on average 35 billion a year on its nuclear weapons complex today it spends an estimated 55 billion the nuclear weapons budget is spread across the department of defense department of energy the department of homeland security and the government doesnt publicly disclose how much it is but the last year that the elements were aggregated together it spent at least 52 4 billion thats in 2008 according to the carnegie endowment for peace that doesnt include classified programs and it was 5 times the state department budget 7 times the epa and 14 times what the department of energy spent on everything else it does indeed the president agreed to a 200 billion modernization in order to secure the approval of the strategic arms reduction treaty in the senate well perhaps its time for us to take a step back and ask what is actually the purpose who is the enemy that this nuclear arsenal is going to deter the nuclear arsenal didnt stop iran from pursuing nuclear weapons its not helping us at all with the terrorists who are now the central focus of our security concerns it doesnt help in iraq or afghanistan and we basically have a stalemate between russia and china nuclear weapons have not been used since world war ii they likely never will be so why do we need landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles bombers and submarine launch delivery systems all three of them do we really need 12 new strategic submarines that will cost almost 5 billion a year if were lucky and contain costs who actually is being deterred by this massive spending and buildup exactly what are the circumstances 30 years from now that call for this massive stockpile of weapons and three redundant delivery systems you know recent articles in the post by walter pincus really focused on this theres dana priests work also in the post gao reportsyou dont have to dig very deeply to find out that this is a bloated flawed program with little technical benefit for us now a great deal of fiscal pain currently and well into the future twentyone years ago president george h w bush unilaterally announced the elimination of thousands of landbased tactical nuclear weapons stationed in europe and an end to the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons on surface ships attack submarines and landbased naval aircraft billions had been spent over the years on such weapons but there was really never any plans for how to use them most have been dismantled and the united states today is no weaker most frankly have not even noticed what could we accomplish over the next 10 years with the same sort of bold thinking on the part of the president the pentagon and members in congress its time that we find out"],

topic because were going back again once more to the subject of mercury but really were going to a more basic subject than mercury and that is the subject of freedom because this energy independence and security act of 2007 is a de facto ban on the plain old lightbulb that americans have known a long time its the incandescent bulb and this de facto ban essentially says that all the new lightbulbs have to be these mercury vapor fluorescent lightbulbs and so the question that comes to my mind is aside from the benefits of one type of lightbulb over anotherand you could argue the benefits the mercury vapor lightbulb is a little more expensive but it saves energy but the incandescent lightbulb burns more energy but it doesnt have any mercury youre bringing into your living room but the point though is dont we trust our constituents to pick the kind of lightbulb that they want im just wondering if theres anybody in this chamber who wants to stand up and vote and say im going to tell my constituents what kind of lightbulb they ought to buy i mean lightbulbs are used in a lot of different contexts a lot of different situations and if people want one of those mercury vapor bulbs thats got good efficiency fine let them buy one but dont tell them they cant buy another kind of bulb that may meet their circumstances and i think thats the kind of arrogance that the public is really fed up with out of congress is when we have this arrogant attitude that were going to tell people even what kind of lightbulb to buy and so what my amendment was going to do was of course to strike this piece of legislation technically we cant do that on this appropriations bill so we have to wait for a different venue in order to do it but i would conclude with the observation that for decade after decade in america the symbol of innovation and bright ideas was always the lightbulb and unfortunately this bill is a bulb that just seems to barely get dim"], [0.004226595163345337,

this committee the bill has been prepared on a bipartisan basis and i support the bill i know that chairman rogers will be glad to hear that i am happy to report that the bill provides the funds necessary to support our troops both at home and in the field it also makes the investment in research and development and acquisition needed to fully equip our troops and maintain our nations technological edge within the funds provided and after careful review the committee exercised its constitutional responsibility to allocate resources to those programs that best support the requirements of our military forces in writing this bill the committee had to make hard choices the allocation for this bill is 530 billion 9 billion below the request while this is 17 billion above the fiscal year 2011enacted level much of the increase is absorbed by the military pay operation and maintenance and the defense health program accounts the bill also provides the funds needed to support unitedstates service personnel examples of this include the military pay accounts fund at a 1 6 percent raise consistent with the budget request and the level included in the housepassed fiscal year 2012 armed services authorization bill the bill also provides 32 3 billion for the defense health program including 125 million above the request to continue the committees longstanding efforts to improve research and treatment of traumatic brain injury and psychological health conditions the bill also includes funding increases for several research efforts including peerreviewed breast cancer prostate cancer ovarian cancer and lung cancer research the bill fully funds 2 3 billion requested for family programs and adds funding for several initiatives including 250 million to replace schools owned by local education authorities and 40 million for impact aid the bill addresses many of dods most pressing investment needs it funds 10 ships as requested in the budget and 32 joint strike fighter aircraft i would like to have seen more strike fighter aircraft because i believe theyre doing a much better job on this program last year it was in some trouble this year admiral venlet has said repeatedly that theyre in fact ahead of the training schedule so i think this is very good news the bill also adds funding to fill gaps in dod capabilities some examples include the m1a2 system enhancement package 272 million is included to prevent a break in production of tanks and this is something that our committee agreed with on an overwhelming basis that shutting down the tank line in ohio would be a terrible mistake because wed lose the skilled workers and then were going to reopen this tank line in 2 or 3 years and it would just be a waste of money so we bridged that gap hmmwv force protection 50 million is added to develop and test and improve armor and other blast protection technologies on the hmmwv long range strike 100 million is added to reduce technical risk and schedule risks for this program were moving ahead on a replacement for the trident submarine the c17 replacement is included to replace the operational loss of a c17 aircraft the committee has steadfastly replacedwhen there have been operational losses weve replaced the equipment this is another example special operation command shortfalls this is one thing we had in our bill in 2011 and this year an increase of 250 million is added to address unfunded requirements identified by the special operations command national guard and reserve equipment 1 5 billion is included to fund equipment shortfalls in national guard and reserve equipment intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance 50 million is included above the request to continue to fill gaps in dod isr equipment israeli missile defense programs 130 million is added to enhance israeli missile defense programs including the arrow missile defense system small business innovative research 50 million is included to continue the committees efforts for sbir phase iii transition historically black colleges and universities 20 million is added to continue defense research at historically black colleges and universities energy efficiency improvements the bill includes 82 million above the request to field equipment that will reduce the energy footprint of deployed marine corps units the bill also includes 10 million above the request for pilot programs to improve dod energy efficiency the bill provides 118 7 billion for operations in afghanistan and iraq and for continuing the withdrawal of unitedstates forces from iraq the bill ensures that troops have essential force protection and provides the means for the afghans to provide their own security the bill includes 12 8 billion to train afghanistans national security forces while the bill provides essential support for our troops i remain concerned about our nations direction in pakistan and ongoing operations in afghanistan there is cause to question the reliability of our partnership with both countries in the light of recent events we must reassess the extent of unitedstates military involvement and the objectives of unitedstates foreign policy in that part of the world reexamining whether unitedstates national security requires a continued deployment of over 100 000 unitedstates service personnel i welcome president obamas decision to start the withdrawals and i also urge a ceasefire and a political settlement after a careful review of the security situation i believe it is time to significantly accelerate the withdrawal of unitedstates forces to accomplish this objective responsibly will take some care by necessity a political solution in afghanistan will involve negotiations with taliban representatives it will also demand taking into account the interests of surrounding nations to ensure that those neighbors do not fight with one another along sectarian or tribal divides within afghanistan finally we must guard against creating a vacuum similar to the one that occurred at the end of the soviet occupation in 1989 even with these cautions in mind i believe it is time to begin the process of bringing the level of deployed unitedstates troops in line with a new assessment of our security interests in the region i look forward to hearing from general petraeus and general odierno we worked with them on the surge in iraq which turned out to be very successful the military has done a very good job in helmand and kandahar and has dominated the taliban in recent times which is very positive we still have a problem on the eastern front between afghanistan and pakistan and we need to continue to put pressure on al qaeda though the capture and death of osama bin laden was something that all the troops that have served here since 2001 should take satisfaction in the person who led the effort against the united states in one of the most horrific acts and one of the most economic destabilizing acts that has ever occurred to our country while i have concerns about our nations policies in afghanistan and pakistan i strongly support this bill its a bipartisan bill and it provides the resources needed by our troops i urge your support for the bill i also want to thank the staff i know chairman young will join me in this we have a tremendous staff that works together they worked together when i was chairman theyre working together now that chairman young hashe had been chairman before and has now regained his chairmanship and the staff has done an extraordinary job its a major piece of work to put together a 530 billion bill and know all these programs and i commend them for their good work i reserve the balance of my time"],

bill to the floor this bill takes several steps to ensure our military readiness including the restoration of funding to retain at least three ticonderoga class guided missile cruisers that the navy proposed to retire well before the end of their expected service life the conference also added an additional 32 tactical airlift aircraft that are essential to meeting the armys direct support airlift missions these additional force structure changes are essential to ensuring our military meets mission requirements the bill also refuses to authorize another round of brac which i believe was founded on a flawed premise that assumes the administrations proposal for a reduced force structure is correct i categorically refuse to accept a diminished department of defense and believe that additional force structure is necessary to support our combatant commanders while i support this bill id be remiss if i did not express my concern associated with continued discussions on further reductions to the department of defense budget while i believe the federal government including the department of defense needs to seek additional efficiencies i reject the notion that additional cuts to federal government should be levied on the backs of our servicemen and women who provide so much we hold a special trust with these men and women and we should oppose any proposal that seeks to diminish the promises provided to our valiant servicemembers i hope and encourage our members to support this bill"]]}
