393 million in grants would be awarded to the states as an incentive to improve their elementary and secondary schools each state could apply for these funds through the development of state plans which set standards for education the bill would require states to establish standards of contentor what children should know in english math or other subjects at certain points in their education local school districts would also be eligible for subgrants from the state to develop and implement comprehensive reform at the local school district level as well the bill further establishes a national education goals panel charged with building a national consensus for education improvement and reporting on the nations progress in meeting the national education goals never before has our nation had standards for what students should know these standards will enable america to set voluntary goals for which all students can strive the bill also establishes a national education standards

other countries h r 1804 is a departure from the way the federal government has previously dealt with education not only does the bill call for voluntary national standards but it calls for the relaxing of regulations and emphasizes academic achievement instead the bill supports creativity to develop new and innovative approaches to educating our nations children further h r 1804 stresses improvement for all children unlike existing federal programs which target special groups of children this legislation seeks broadbased improvement of education for all children for our nation to

consider this important piece of legislation the gallatin range consolidation and protection act my legislation consolidates checkerboard lands in montana the consolidation ii being presented because of the real public lands disaster that is looming in montana if this legislation is not adopted by this spring just north of yellowstone national park the gallatin range connects to the other mountains of the yellowstone ecosystem like a spoke in a wheel this range was not protected a century ago when the park was set aside because every other section of the area was granted to the railroads as payment for the transamerica construction this ranges importance to the integrity of yellowstone has never been questioned however and it has essentially remained wild ever since this range is the home of the largest elk herd in america along with countless other species including the endangered grizzly bear the range also is the headwaters of some of the most pristine streams and rivers anywhere in this country the first attempt to consolidate these lands happened in 1925 and since then there have been countless attempts to bring the gallatin range into federal ownership the federal government has already spent more than 12 million to acquire elk winter range and the house of representatives had held countless hours of testimony on the importance of these lands the house itself passed no fewer than three bills to complete these land trades and purchases but still the range remains chopped up in checkerboard land ownership not long ago the railroad sold its land to a private timber company to avoid a hostile takeover and the company has since again sold the lands to several new owners interested in timber and development part of the new sale arrangement requires that timber be provided off the private lands and so now we face a serious problem if we do not solve these intermingled land problems by the time the contractual harvest is necessary the days of the gracious corporate neighbor in and around the gallatin are over and increasingly important recreation lands will be subdivided posted off limits or sold for private hunting rights if this legislation is not signed into law i helped bring the various parties together last year and we hammered out this agreement without this agreement in the gallatin and because we face a june deadline the company will soon enter and log the nationally significant porcupine drainage with the public losing precious recreation opportunities and scarce public access i am committed to seeing this does not happen and i am hopeful that we can continue to move quickly to assure these lands are brought into public ownership the local landowners are in agreement conservation organizations and local environmentalists are in agreement the park service and forest service are in agreement and we need the congress and the president to act this opportunity dreamed of since 1925 must not be lost and itshows the continued support of this committee and the congress in seeing that this job is done i would like to note that some of the folks who are supporting this legislation as a way of showing the broad cross section of support for this bill they include all three members of montanas congressional delegation the governor of montana the local county commissioners the mayor of bozeman the montana outfitters and guides association the wilderness society the greater yellowstone coalition the cottonwood canyon homeowners association local snowmobile and motorcycle groups employees at the belgrade mill i would like to particularly note a statement that i received from the montana wilderness association flathead chapter regarding the lands in its area which are involved in the trade this statement is important because of some who believed that the lands in the flathead which are exchanged were not reviewed by the local environmental community they were in fact suggested by local conservationists as suitable for trading as this body knows this type of legislation is difficult to negotiate and even more difficult to pass through congress as custodians of our federal land congress must be very careful that any trade we consider meet the most stringent requirements of fairness and value the trade must clearly be in the publics interest and must fulfill public policy goals i take this responsibility very seriously and have never considered any public land trade without clearly knowing that these goals be met montana has been aggressive in consolidating lands and we have never had a problem to date only because with the help of this body we have assured that any consideration had clear public policy goals these trades in the gallatin meet those policy requirements and the 15 years i have been involved in this discussion have shaped these trades to assure they are in the public interest any changes in these trades or consideration of other trades also should have to meet the conditions applied to the gallatin exchange this legislation does not represent the end of the federal governments interests in the gallatin this legislation is just the continuation of an historic concern and this legislation will set a clear process to identify and as sure the continued protection of our national treasures in the greater yellowstone ecosystem i also want to note that there were some concerns recently raised by a local landowner group in montana about several of the sections traded from federal ownership in an area known as north bridgers there have been discussions brokered by my office and involving both the private landowners and the forest service which continue to seek assurances on appropriate guidelines for private harvest on traded lands the north bridgers these efforts also involve the identification of new land combinations and alternatives that help us better achieve protection of the local landowners and still achieve our goals i have worked with our two senators on these issues raised by the folks north of bozeman and i believe accommodation is possible within the framework of the legislation we pass today i will continue working with the senators as the bill is considered in the senate and to share with them my work on behalf of the north bridgers homeowners association it is only through compromise and hard work that these difficult land inholding situations can be solved and i remain committed to continuing in that effort"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman from connecticut for yielding and thank her for her leadership in helping to pass the presidents reconciliation plan and his economic plan for growth and reducing the deficit and also for her very magnificent presentation and very clear presentation of the new direction that this deficit reduction plan will take our country i thank her very much for giving me this opportunity to participate in her special order tonight i am very pleased that the presidents plan as amended by the house and senate conferees turns out to be a very profamily plan it does this by its investments that it makes in people that helps at the very same time to reduce the deficit to give our people work not welfare and to give them hope not despair how does it do this well it is profamily in many respects one is its childrens initiatives that are contained in this package childhood immunization the family preservation and support act the mickey leland hunger relief act and the earned income tax credit in addition to the enterprise zones which will help create jobs in some of the areas of our country which need them the most i would just like to take a few minutes to elaborate on some of these points and then move on to some of the economic arguments that spring from these i believe that while these are profamily and they are investments in people they will help get this country moving as well as reduce the deficit as far as the immunization initiative is concerned president clinton said on our nation is the only industrialized nation in the entire world that does not guarantee childhood vaccination for all children it ought to be like clean water and clear air it ought to be part of the fabric of our life so spoke our president and he said that in the context of only 55 percent of our nations 2yearolds fully immunized against vaccinepreventable diseases in 1991 because of these low immunization rates a measles epidemic swept across the country with 55 000 victims 166 people were killed in the epidemic and 11 000 americans were hospitalized this could have been prevented next in the package i want to commend our president and conferees for putting funds in for family preservation 1 billion child abuse and neglect is an escalating national crisis of devastating proportions nearly 3 million children were reported physically sexually or emotionally abused or neglected last year 3 million children in our country and at least 3 children a day die from abuse most before their first birthday that is hard to imagine while tie number of children reported abused in fact more than doubled between 1981 and 1991 federal funding has been cut in half i am very pleased that the president and conferees included as i mentioned 51 billion in this package next the mickey leland childhood hunger relief act is a very important domestic antihunger initiative the most important introduced in the last 16 years i am very pleased that the president has and well we would like more money always but i think at this moment it is 2 5 billion for the mickey leland hunger relief act it would allow families in addition to the funds it also will allow families to deduct high shelter costs in the same way that elderly and disabled households do so at present this is very very important for our families who exceed 50 percent of their income for shelter it would also encourage payment and collection of child support and assist working families and children then in that package i conclude my focus there on the earned income tax credit this proposal substantially raises the level of credit for working families with children to lift working families out of poverty and provide the modest credit to very poor workers without children to help ensure that the doors of opportunity are open for all you would expect i say to my colleague the gentlewoman from connecticut that i would be supportive of a program that contained these initiatives being on the progressive side of the spectrum in this body and i am pleased that they are in the package again i think they not only help people they help reduce the deficit but i do want to turn now to some business voices which favor the package let me say first that the american people according to the wall street journal last week they reported that americans are expressing more support for president clintons economic plan as it nears its crucial final vote by a comfortable margin of 54 to 32 percent people say that the clinton plan would represent a step in the right direction and the survey indicates that many americans are sour on the conduct of mr clintons republican critics the american people support this plan i now want to address some of the business leaders last week 58 business leaders many of them republicans from across the country endorsed president clintons economic plan i would like to call to the attention of my colleagues and our listeners the comments of some of those business leaders chairman august busch of anheuserbusch said we applaud the fundamental fairness of your initial plan as well as the diligence with which you have worked to keep equity a cornerstone of the final product jerry pearlman chairman of zenith electronics said i strongly support your 500 billion deficit reduction plan and the selective spending cute and appropriate investments i have no doubt that your plan will meet the major challenge of reducing the deficit while stimulating economic growth job creation and investment further to this xerox ceo paul allaire said successful passage of the budget reconciliation bill is a critical step in restoring longterm economic growth and job creation the presidents economic program is a balanced approach that shifts national policy away from deficit spending and toward jobcreating investment the chairman of time warner gerald levin said this legislation is our only opportunity to move forward on the economic front to fail at this moment would have grave consequences for americans and american business around the globe i am proud to join you in encouraging swift and positive congressional action the ceo of tenneco mike walsh said the united states cannot continue to live on borrowed time and borrowed money we elected a new president because we wanted change now it is time to act not blink or quit the president is taking on one of the most critical issues we face as a country and it is time for us to stand up support him and start attacking the deficit and then finally the president of h r block harry buckley said the majority of h r blocks clients are middle and lowerincome taxpayers many of whom would benefit from the presidents plan to expand and simplify the eitc and distribute the tax burden more fairly throughout all income brackets the new york times said in its editorial last month antitax rhetoric poses a threat to the common sense when the american congressional conferees meet this week to begin the arduous task of reconciling the house and senate budget bill we want common sense to prevail over political rhetoric we want this house to pass this budget very strongly you i say to my colleague presented very convincing arguments and compelling evidence of why this plan will work and why it must be done i think that it is clear that from left to right from people to business it is clearly viewed that we must reduce the deficit we must create jobs we must invest in people we must pass this package again i commend the gentlewoman for calling this special order and look forward to meeting here the next time we urge our colleagues to support the reconciliation package"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "i wish to join this evening my colleague the gentlewoman from the state of maryland in reporting on our delegation mission to mexico the first women members factfinding mission in over one decade i would like to enter my full remarks into the record but this evening i wish to say that this was the first ever congressional women members delegation to mexico we were there for over 4 days and our focus was extensive investigations and discussions with individuals from the government as well as the ordinary people of mexico regarding the proposed north american freetrade agreement the bipartisan group of members titled our mission the human face of trade we wanted to open up this agreement and take a look at what it meant not just for the people of the united states and canada but for the people of mexico as well because of course the ordinary people of mexico will not have a chance to speak out on this agreement in that oneparty state our delegation began its journey in mexico city by first meeting with minister of commerce jaime jose serra puche the delegation also met in mexico city with a broad array of environmental humanrights religious and labor organizations comprised of ordinary citizens both in mexico city and in the border communities that we traveled to just south of brownsville tx and mcallen tx in matamoros and reynosa mexico while we were in mexico city our delegation conducted the first ever binational meeting with women legislators from all political parties from both the united states and mexico this event occurred at the home of united states ambassador to mexico john negroponte our delegation visitdd barrios in mexico city and colonias on the border in the matamoros and reynosa we spoke at length with the people who lived there under appalling conditions our delegation discussed border area issues with the residents there with the socalled maquiladora workers who work in the unitedstates companies located south of the border we met with local government officials industry leaders and others gov ann richards of texas made a special effortto fly down to mexico and join our group for an evening of very frank discussions i might say about the proposed nafta agreement our delegation returned from our mission to mexico with these major findings first it is absolutely necessary that the united states and mexico take the time necessary to shape a continental agreement that encompasses the full range of economic social and political issues attendant to such integration the current treaty does not even come close to what is needed the dislocation of jobs of people who have been thrown out of work in the united states and in canada already by unregulated trade confirms the dangers of continuing a handsoff approach to a narrowly cast trade and tariff agreement that does not address these broader issues this is especially true where wage disparities and living conditions are as divergent as they are in the united states and mexico the majority of our meetings were with mexican women who have been most affected by trade policy we have met thousands of united states workers who have lost their jobs to these companies that have located to mexico largely united states companies now over 2 000 of them south of our border with mexico but it is interesting that over 70 percent of the people that have been hired to work in these relocated plants are women mexican women women who live at a subsistence level in fact we met one woman who worked for zenith corp who after 10 years of seniority with our unitedstates company located south of the border takes home for 48 hours of work in a week 15 75 that is her net pay mexicos rising unemployment rate and falling real wages have severely jeopardized the ability of millions of mexicans to fe3d and house their families we met many of these people highwage manufacturing jobs have been drained from communities across our country to lowwage maquiladoras operating in mexico we visited many of these runaway plants along the border but in mexico these jobs have not resulted in rising standards of living for maquiladora workers in fact that was a misconception i had i went down there and i thought if i met the workers in mexico who are workers in these united states firms that have relocated their standard of living would be a little bit higher than people who would be working for mexicanowned companies i found that was not true in fact as you look at what has happened in mexico the rising unemployment rate and falling real wages have severely jeopardized the ability of millions of mexicans to feed and house their families we heard that between 35 and 40 percent of the people of mex ico are now part of what we call the informal sector of their economy that means they do not really get a paycheck that means that they are out there selling chiclets on the street their children are performing as little clowns on the corners to try to pick up little bits of money that they can take home to buy beans and rice for their families it is truly a lowwage economy highwage manufacturing jobs have been drained from communities across our country to these lowwage companies but in mexico these jobs have not resulted in rising standards of living for maquiladora workers but have resulted in a double tragedy because of the subsistence wages that workers are paid so not only do united states workers lose their jobs here but mexican workers earn so very little money that there is not any way for those wages to produce the great booming consumer market that we hear so much about from the proponents of this agreement and why because el pacto the wage agreement between the leaders of the government of mexico industries that have located there and official unions have held wages to onetenth of united states levels in fact even though the government claims there has been an 8 percent increase in wages in mexico over the last year inflation down there in fact is running at 15 percent and interest rates are 35 percent so there is no way for the average family down there to upgrade their standard of living in fact workers in mexico have seen their real wages decline over the last decade and all economists will agree on that we met with apparel workers in mexico city who earn 40 cents an hour we visited people in mexico city neighborhoods who asked us to help them in their efforts to gain the right to food as a part of mexicos constitution because so many of their friends are hungry and we met with them in their neighborhoods saw where they lived went to the neighborhood stores that they tried to set up in a kind of cooperative way trying to buy beans and rice so that they can subsist i asked them how do you define poverty thinking that they would give me a dollar or peso figure definition they said we define poverty as anyone in our country who has less than 60 percent of the calories needed on an average day to merely meet subsistence levels of food and nutrition further it became clear to us that united states companies operating in mexico along with mexicos own domestic firms have enjoyed the addltional advantages of extremely lax enforcement of environmental and labor regulations as well for anyone with a conscience it is disturbing to view the conditions under which the majority of mexican people live our delegation would like to highlight these specific findings and over the weeks we will be bringing more of this information forward to the american people first of all access for mexicans including all of its elected representatives even the fledging opposition party to information about the ongoing trade negotiations we were asked for copies of the proposed treaty the people of mexico have so little information about what is being proposed that the ordinary people including some of their own elected representatives do not have information from the ruling party that information is now tightly controlled by the mexican government inhibiting informed policy making we also were asked that we as members of congress pay more attention to the human impact of mexicos recent economic policies which has gone largely ignored in this country these impacts include unemployment that is approaching 40 percent changes in mexicos land ownership system for its farmers that will drive 10 million more people off the land these people are wandering through mexico flocking into some of the large cities they no longer are growing their own food this is not an inconsequential issue it has an impact on our own immigration policy and also has an impact on whether mexico will be able to become the stable economy as our closest neighbor we saw the inability of wage growth to keep pace with inflation we also noted that mexicos foreign debt has also climbed despite their efforts to try to lower it from s89 billion to 103 billion now the severe economic restraints that they have put on their own people have not resulted in mexico being able to pay off the debts that it owes to foreign banks that is a huge part of the problem they are facing we received a request from concerned mexican scholars that united states and the press investigate the structure of mexicos stock market which they claim is controlled by mexicos wealthiest families allowing them to manipulate it for their profit profit for a very few we received a comhplaint by border communities that the mexican government assesses a housing tax on the lowpaid workers in these maquiladora plants which amounts to over 62 5 million cumulatively last year but these funds were not returned to the border area where housing is desperately needed and where environmental cleanup is desperately needed we received a request that our congress give more attention to the mexican governments preparation of its environmental inspectors which may be inadequate to train them to recognize instances of environmental noncompliance in fact we were told that the average inspector most of them having just been hired because of this agreement being talked about they received about 45 hours of training the north american freetrade agreement as negotiated will not contribute to the promise of raising standards of living for the families of all three nations the negotiated agreements narrow focus on tariff and investment barriers overlooks issues which a true free trade agreement must address real enforcement of labor and environmental laws wage disparities in exportoriented industries accessible dispute resolution which provides justice to citizens and businesses of all three nations and implementation of the polluterpays principle to fund desperately needed environmental cleanup and infrastructure improvements we need more attention to the human rights issue and to the electoral process in mexico itself which even makes their presidential elections called into question because of the manner in which people are treated at the polls and the way votes are counted the gradual and successful integration of the countries of the european community should serve as a model for our own continent we invited the mexican women parliamentarians from all parties to continue discussions with us on these important questions we will reissue that invitation our delegation intends to continue meeting as a working group we are in the process of preparing a detailed report on our findings that we will use to share with our congressional leadership members of congress president clinton and other administration officials as well as the american people we also hope to work with the office of the trade representative to ensure that negotiations on naftas parallel agreements fully address our concerns currently they do not this factfinding mission to mexico was the first step on a journey that will not end until we forge an agreement with mexico that will truly benefit the families of both of our countries and all countries on our continent i thank the chair for its patience this evening"],

enter into the debate on a social issue that will impact the lives of every american every man woman and child in this country what could be more important than taking time to discuss the pros and cons i was delighted as i am sure my colleagues were today to see that the bipartisan negotiations that have been going on for weeks now many many hours in length were rewarded were fruitful in coming out and announcing today a bipartisan health care proposal so we really have a debate now we have a clintongephardt we have a clintonmitchell bill and we have a health care reform bill with bipartisan support that deals with the health care crisis in this country from the standpoint of private sector reforms to expand coverage to more americans than ever before and to begin to control the spiraling costs in health care i think there are a number of things out there in the public sector right now to assist us as we look at this health care debate one of the books recently published written by dr jane orient she is an internist in tucson arizona and she heads the association of american physicians and surgeons with over 4 000 members nationwide the title of her book is a very timely book indeed your doctor is not in i think she provides us some important insights let me share a few of them she says first of all the proposed remedies for the health care crisis are snake oil and you shouldnt swallow them further the private doctor is an endangered species in the end we will have a herd a nice placid socialized tamed cudchewing herd readers should care about the plight of doctors for one and only one reasons some day they might need one you may think you know what the hippocratic oath says but you probably dont and you should learn about it before they do away with it entirely the hippocratic oath is built on physician autonomy it reads i will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment eurther do you want your doctor to place society or the department of health and human services ahead of his being independent she says further managed care is about preventing medical care in order to make money for thirdparty payers or to save money for the government behind the slick advertising managed care is little more than prepayment for rationed health care rationed care is one of the most disastrous things that can ever happen to the health care practice in this country then i conclude with her insight there is no utopia i will only maintain that a free market in medicine is the best of the avallfble alternatives and the one that does the least harm that is what doctors do the least harm that is what the hippocratic oath says the way we do the least harm although it is not perfect is to maintain a free market in the health care system another recent book a novel published entitled fatal cure by robin cook a bestselling novelist he as a physician as a doctor imagines what will happen to the health care service industry in this country should we resort should we go in these coming weeks to governmentrun health care system i only share with the listeners this evening and with my colleagues a couple of paragraphs of the dialog that he imagines might take place some day he says everyone knows that doctor patient relationships are the cornerstone of medical care one of the characters says maybe thats passe the current reality is determined by a new army of medical bureaucrats being created by government intervention all of a sudden economics and politics have reached the ascendancy in the medical arena i am afraid the major concern is the bottom line on the balance sheet not patient care the problem is washington every time the government gets seriously involved in medical care they seem to screw things up they try to please everybody and end up pleasing no one dr cook is absolutely right that would be the result of governmentrun health care in the washington post not exactly an advocate of freeenterprise health care certainly one that has espoused the governmentrun health care in its editorial policies dana priest in a frontpage story entitled health bill may have no substitute for bureaucracy he writes just recently president clinton and members of congress last week hailed the senate democratic leaderships health bill as a vast improvement over the bureaucracyladen 1 462page plan produced by the white house but the 1 410page bill proposed by senate majority leader george j mrrchell dmaine also would create dozens of new federal and state agencies they would have untested authority to centralize reorganize monitor and enforce the way medical care is bought sold and to a lesser extent practiced in this country and indeed the post is right they would have untested authority to centralize reorganize monitor and enforce i understand that the clintonmitchell bill in the senate has over 20 new federal bureaucracies that will be created now before i yield back to the gentleman i want to share a letteri am from the state of arkansas i have served 8 years in the arkansas legislature with nowpresident clinton our president was then my governor our chief executive in the state of arkansas many times during those 12 years that he was our governor the issue of abortion and more specifically the issue of public funding of abortion arose in various debates in arkansas as it has been throughout our country a major issue and it continues to be a major bone of contention and a major issue in the health care debate in every major governmentrun health care plan that has been presented to this congress the provision for reproductive services or abortion services if you will has been included that means that every american under a governmentrun health care system would be subsidizing the practice of abortion regardless of what their moral conscience or religious convictions would be september 26 1986 governor clinton then governor wrote in a letter to the arkansas righttolife people a letter in which he said in part because many of the questions do concern the issue of abortion i would like for your members to be informed of my position on the states responsibility in that area i am opposed to abortion and to government funding of abortions we should not spend state funds on abortions because so many people believe abortion is wrong that was governor clinton who is now president of the united states saying he not only opposed abortion but he opposed public funding of abortion and believed it was wrong to require people who believe it is wrong to pay for abortions and yet today he has included that insisted on including that in every governmentrun health care program that he has advocated and supported then i would concludeand i am indebted to our colleague from the other side of the aisle the gentleman from minnesota tim penny democrat for his dear colleague letter in which he points out something that i think is vital in this debate in the coming weeks he points out that major votes of the 20th century on large social policy changes have always been accorded overwhelming bipartisan support he enumerates some of those the social security act of 1935 96 percent of the democrats supported that 81 percent of the republicans supported that and it passed by a vote of 372 to 33 the development of the interstate highway system federalaid highway act of 1956 major policy change in our country 93 percent of the democrats supported it 98 percent of the republicans supported it passed by a vote of 388 to now the civil rights act of 1964 what more significant social change has this congress enacted than the civil rights act of 1964 sixtyone percent of the democrats supported the civil rights bill 80 percent of the republicans supported the civil rights act and it passed by a vote of 290 to i could go on the clean air act the medicare act the water pollution act all of these passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities here we are told that we must in the coming weeks have a health care reform bill that is going to affect the lives of every american the biggest social change in 50years and we are going to do it with the barest of majorities it is going to be forced through in spite of overwhelming opposition not only by the republican party but the polls indicate by the american people when the buscapade came to town i saw the big banners on the side saying pass it now and i said to myself pass what now at that point we did not even have a bill no one had read a bill yet they say we have got to hurry it through we have got to do it now yet the polls say 65 percent of the american people say they want to wait they want to read it want to study it want to react to it and that is the way major social change ought to take place it ought to take place with the american people aware of it the american people supportive of it and with a large bipartisan majority supporting it in congress we do not have that and that is~why we ought to wait on health care reform i thank the gentleman"], [6.29250029859918e-09, 6.29250029859918e-09, 0, "i am going to speak today on the bryant bill a

home schooling that forced the liberals to pull out a provision that would have killed home schooling it is the grassroots pressure of the righttolife movement that has sustained a fight that liberals would have crushed years ago it is the grassroots pressure of people who believe in the second amendment which has stopped the efforts by liberals to strip americans of the right to bear arms it has

national battlefield park amendments of 1994 the purpose of the manassas national battiefield park amendments of 1994 is to provide for the orderly termination of easements and property used for public utility purposes at the manassas national battlefield park this legislation is necessary to avert a costly and public lawsuit that virginia power will be forced to file should this clarification not become law you may recall that in 1988 the congress passed legislation saving the land where the second battle of manassas occurred thereby avoiding development of this historic civil war battlefield site in so doing the national park service became the owners of an easement which virginia power previously owned and on which were constructed major electric power transmission lines because the general statute of limitations on condemnation claims expires in november virginia power would be forced to file a 60 millioir lawsuit to compensate them for ther condemned easement and transmission lines this house is responding responsibly to this problemr by extending the time for virginia power and the national park service to work together td craft an equitable cost effective solution to this problem if this technical corrections bill is not passed virginia power will be forced to file suit to preserve its fifth amendment takings claim such a costly suit would be a waste of both federal and virginia powers resources this legislation which is similar to legislation i introduced in may hr 4435 would merely clarify that proceedings seeking a determination of just compensation with respect to the taking of property used for public utility purposes must commence within 3 years after the date of enactment of the manassas national battlefield park amendments of 1994 this would allow virginia power and the national park service another 3 years to resolve virginia powers claim for compensation this will save taxpayer money and save virginia powers ratepayers money because virginia power will not have to file a costly lawsuit in federal district court this house should know that passage of this legislation merely means that this body supports a 3year extension in which virginia power and the park service can resolve this claim thereby avoiding a costly lawsuit i understand that the national park service has tentative plans to relocate the power lines and is considering three options for so doing i would hope that the park service and virginia power will continue to work together to ensure any future relocation of the powerlines be at the

binding on the president i think even the sponsors of the gilman axhendment recognize that since the chadha decision of the supreme court this has no binding effect and they describe it as a nonbinding resolution what it does however if it is not followed by the adoption of the hamilton amendment is drive a public wedge before the world between the unitedstates house of representatives and the president i do not question the sincerity of any member on the other side but i am deeply troubled that on this issue a virtually solid partisan vote has occurred on the republican side on an issue which has never occurred never occurred in my judgment when it came to a foreign policy issue of a republican president of the united states but letting that aside for the moment those who suggest that it is in the interest of the safety of our troops that we vote this breach between what the president has promised and what they now ask the house to state is i think the greatest danger to the troops there is no single danger to americans abroad greater than the sense that by inflicting casualties we can panic the congress into immediate efforts to cut and run our position will be vulnerable throughout the world if reckless dictators believe that by that kind of a tactic they can underpin their demands for american withdrawal we have a decision made by the president on october 7 which was based on military advice military advice that it would require perhaps up until march 31 for an orderly withdrawal of our forces under conditions where they were protected and where the mission for which we went to somalia could be continued in the meantime i do not think we should forget what american forces have done in somalia they have saved the lives of somewhere between 500 000 and a million people americans can take some great pride in that we have acted to save the lives of upwards of a million people who would be dead today three hundred thousand people starved in the 6 months before president bush decided to intervene in somalia now we would risk that where we still feed i million people by a signal that the united states was about to panic and leave that the congress was not going to support the presidents orderly withdrawal that would be in my judgment a tragedy and it would go far beyond somalia it would go into every place in the world where americans stand in korea for example and in other places where it would be thought that if americans will not stand to face the possibility of warlords in somalia after we have faced hitler and we have faced stalin and we have faced saddam hussein it would be a tragic moment for american resolve american principle and american position around the world do not do this to the president of the united states we should not do this to any president republican or democrat i hope the day will come when republicans and democrats will for any president stand to ensure that when he speaks for our country he

there is anybody that can suggest this country does not have a serious problem with its immigration laws and the security of its borders however to suggest that somehow this legislation is about immigration is to completely mislead the people of this country let us not suggest for a moment that we need not do something about our immigration laws because i happen to believe that we do i am probably a little more conservative on immigration than most of the members on my side of the aisle the fact is that this is a national service bill which is designed to provide opportunities for american citizens to share their experience knowledge and wherewithal with other americans to help build communities to take care of our natural resources and to take care of the people of this country the proponents of this amendment would have us believe that somehow this is a magnet this is an attraction for people who would come to this country illegally to do what to play on a playground that was developed by the youth corps to drink the water from a watershed that was protected by the conservation corps to enroll in a class that is taught by teach america a tutor in one of these programs that is the magnet it is incidental it is going to cost more to figure out who is complying than all of the services that may be rendered to an illegal alien whose house may have been taken away in a flood whose job may have disappeared in a flood or hurricane or whose child happens to be part of a program that is part of a much larger program are we going to police the playgrounds to make sure no illegal alien ever lets their children play on that playground because national service volunteers may have worked to con struct that playground are we going to police every soup line in every church in this country so that if any food or service is volunteered through this act that no one shall ever show up how are we going to enforce this create a bureaucracy for this purpose if in fact if in fact the members want to deal with immigration then let us deal with immigration through the laws and the jurisdictions of the committees and the programs of this country i am sure we will have an asylum bill on the floor and i am sure there will be amendments that is the proper vehicle national service this amendment on migration is a mat ter with which we this bill is an attempt to do two things must deal at some point your presito try to heighten the political sen dent has 4aid so our president spoke sitivity of this issue for political pur yesterday on this and we will be dealposes and also to try to do damage to ing with it we will deal with it on the national service program that this every bill that comes along if that is president has asked us to pass he the only vehicle we have at present asked us to pass this program to try to this one before us is the one we are heal and build america dealing with we will not deal with this what do we see from the proponents issue as a matter of convenience to the of this amendment it is an effort to bills that you would like us to deal try to divide and split america on with we will see it again and again some kind of conjecture that this is america simply cannot afford to proabout billions of taxpayer dollars that vide health care and welfare for all of through this program are going to be the worlds poor

a rule for the longawaited haiti resolution that incident is likely to be in the minds of many members who are wondering are we headed down the same road in haiti with each day that passes it seems more likely on sunday officials confirmed that the mis sion that once was to contain fewer than 15 000 american troops hasswelled to 20 931 and while the administration hailed the arrival of 262 caribbean troops yesterday it is abundantly clear that this is an american mission implemented with american tax dollars and anerican soldiers and in the eyes of many of our allies at the expense of american credibility in the weeks before united states forces landed in haiti americans were assured by the administration that our men and women in uniform would not be drawn into the middle of haitianonhaitian violence that they wouldnt become the policemen in a 200yearold haitian civil war today it seems clear that that promiselike many others from this administrationis no longer operative

finds dancers instead of gunmen or from my district armedtotheteeth americans raid harmless garden and unitedstates raids haiti firms for weapons today we read gis arrest members of notorious haitian militia they just as easily could have read unitedstates troops drawn further into haiti quagmire yesterday american troops raided a stronghold of the armed political group fraph in search of weapons and then had to turn around and protect the members of that organization from the mobs outside all of this points to what this mornings wall street journal called the schizophrenic nature of united states relations with the different segments of haitian society the united states says it wont take over responsibility for policing haiti however our troops are told they may intervene in the event that fraph and or the police mistreat haitian civilians or they may intervene to save the police and members of fraph if the mobs turn against them no wonder many american soldiers are as confused and frustrated as one young man quoted in the weekend paper ask anyone down here what were doing and theyll say i dont know this is a joke when the house adjourns this week we will do so for the better

those early days is that as we were choosing a vice presidential candidate out in detroit there in 1980 one of the strong recommendations for putting george bush on the ticket was that he brought so much to the ticket with his depth of foreign policy experience something where there was some suspicion that ronald reagan would not have the kinds of credentials to convince america that he could handle the world at that very critical time it turned out that ronald reagan had some very clear ideas of where he wanted the world to go but he had a strong and energetic partner in george bush who helped formulate those policies throughout the reagan era and then brought that depth of experience into his own administration i think the changes that we have seen in the world are a tribute of course to ronald reagan for his vision of what the world could be but also to george bush for being the guy who in many instances went around the world to talk to the foreign leaders and move the process forward and then throughout his administration changed the world in such remarkable ways that people even thinking back on it cannot imagine all that was accomplished what strikes me about that is that he did it so well that by the time we got to the 1992 election america was ready to forget foreign policy they thought the world had been made so safe that we could ignore what was going on in the world turn to someone with a total lack of experience in world affairs for leadership because now was the time to focus on the domestic side of things and particularly on the domestic economy and i think we are now beginning to realize that having someone who understood the world could pick up the phone and call world leaders by their first names who had a longstanding relationship with them was in fact a major asset to this country and one that is terrible missed at the present time but it also seems to me that we do a disservice not to also mention that george bush showed tremendous courage in the management of domestic affairs and i am reminded of that over the last few weeks as i have been reading the stories in the newspaper about how the cable bill the cable regulation bill is beginning to come apart that all of the things that were predicted for it here on the house floor when it was passed are not coming true that in fact cable rates are going up and that the regulation by the government has turned out to be at least a mini disaster that was a case where george bush stood against the current of what he knew was going to happen on capitol hill a lot of us fought with him time after time to maintain his vetoes on capitol hill because we knew the way in which he was working to control the growth of government to control deficits and a lot of these kinds of things was through the power of his veto and time after time with our minimum numbers on capitol hill we were able to sustain those vetoes and president bush was very proud of that record of vetoes sustained and when we went to him and told him that on the cable bill he was likely to lose the easy thing for president bush to have done at that point would have been to say lets preserve the perfect record of vetoes i will go ahead i will hold my nose and i will sign that bill because the votes simply were not there we did not have enough votes to do something about the cable bill but he vetoed it anyway because he did believe that this would come back as something that would not serve the best interests of the american people at the timi he was heavily criticized consumer
