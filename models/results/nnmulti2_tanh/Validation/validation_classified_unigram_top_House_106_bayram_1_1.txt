modifications to fund various popular programs but as time passes all the defects and shortcomings of the bill in spite of the efforts of the subcommittee to try to rationalize its actions serious problems are very apparent in this bill i would just point out the serious shortfall in terms of funding for housing based on obviously cooked numbers apparently from the committees and from the committee on the budget and arguable numbers from the administration some of which i agree and disagree with within this bill there is 945m nearly 1 billion dollars less than in 1999 for housing it is like the house is participating in a continued sham in terms of the budget act the fact of the matter is that the public is rejecting the policy path that has been laid out by the congress but the majority insists on getting up and passing bills that seriously underfund programs and seriously underfund housing this is almost a billion dollars less than what was actually funded last year based on trying to use standardized numbers several billion dollars less than the administration has requested i would say looking at what the need is that the serious problems of the past have now turned into a crisis with regards to housing we cannot continue to use housing as the honey pot to take money out and spread it around to programs that have more popular support in my community in minnesota we have about a 1 percent vacancy rate in fact vouchers that are often provided as an answer very often do not work and will not work so even though all the facts change all the circumstances change the congress acts as if in 1999 is still on a 1997 budget rationale funds are being split off for various purposes here for an 800b in tax breaks for pentagon spending for other matters and yet we do not respond to the various and the deep needs of the low income people in our communities and their housing crisis the homeless funds are cut lead paint abatement funding cut community development housing funds those of the least powerful in our society are shortchanged i urge my colleagues to reject this bill i hope we could get to work and be in reality rather than remain in a state of denial regard the needs of people for shelter in safe sanitary housing once again the gop leadership is relying upon gimmicks to hide their fiscal year 2000 appropriations process train wreck by turning their backs on funding needs for important people programs and failing to invest in important social housing and community development programs the republicans have all but ensured a major confrontation this fall with congressional democrats and the administration the rush to provide tax cuts for special interests and the wealthy have clouded the need to address social program funding realities unfortunately the vahud appropriation bill started out on a sour note with the republican budget blueprint earlier this year adding salt to the wounds the gop majority appropriators chose to lay out unrealistic laborhhseducation 302 b allocations in order to spare from reductions popular defense spending military pork projects and nasa programs all of these increases are provided at the extreme cost of housing and development programs and environmental protection such irresponsible gop policies will put in place a convoluted process of shifting money into popular programs to attract votes and comply with the spending caps at the expense of the powerless in our society sadly this vahud bill continues to force hud to draw the short straw for housing and community development programs and that will impact real people through the loss of jobs and affordable housing there are few improvements to mention though i am pleased that there is finally some commitment to restore 10 million in funding to the fema emergency food and shelter program a program that i have worked with chairman walsh in the past to increase funding however the bill we will vote upon this week continues the theme of the past few years making housing a principal wellspring for spending increases elsewhere and tax cuts for special interests and the wealthy hud estimates that in minnesota we will lose over 23 million jeopardizing 1 600 jobs and almost 2 400 units of housing for lowincome families if this bill were enacted the cuts in hopwa housing for persons with aids and mckinney homeless assistance funds would result in 138 homeless and persons with aids not being served the st paul public housing authority one of the nations best accurately explains the consequence further cuts in public housing funds will jeopardize our safe affordable and quality public housing because cuts in operating subsidies will slow responses to repairs cut key staff who screen applicants and generally impair their ability to apply for and comply with federal programs the lack of commitment and cuts that this vahud bill would deliver will result in fewer resident services and will mean less ability to deter criminal activity and other community concerns unfortunately the vahud appropriations bill cuts close to a billion dollars in funds from huds budget last year and is some 3 billion below the administrations request despite trying to hide the cuts by spreading the pain around it is clear that housing and community development will suffer under this billan atrophy by design this atrophy has also hit successful programs like the neighborhood reinvestment corporation which faces a 10 million cut in this bill further while the overall vahud bill has lost some of the emergency spending gimmicks the gop majority appropriators have chosen instead to gouge ever deeper in the laborhhseducation funds in order to spare the popular veterans and nasa programs predictably housing and community programs have been left with cuts to the community development block grant cdbg and even the mckinney homeless assistance programs housing for persons with aids public housing and the list goes on no new housing assistance despite the commitments to authorize 100 000 new vouchers made in the 1999 budget authorization this is a warped policy especially at a time when millions of people are on waiting lists for housing are on the streets and according to a department of housing study deems 5 3 million families have worst case housing needs this situation is frankly dire the circumstances and facts change the federal budget is in better shape but lowincome housing needs have exploded yet the funding response ignores the facts the real need of our communities which should be addressed by this bill is in preserving our federally assisted housing from the optout or prepayment phenomenon by matching state programs to keep buildings affordable or marking up market rents so landlords stay with our successful programs but how will we be able to move forward for the future with preservation efforts when this bill does not squarely address the real housing needs of this country with what we have now we are already sliding backward and the passage of the vahud bill this week is like throwing a drowning person an anvil this is not acceptable policy for housing our people or creating the economic opportunities that will help them move forward in tandem with their communities and neighborhoods this appropriation process and budget blueprint is wholly inadequate if we are going to cut spending it must be based on equal sharing of the burden not loading all the cuts on the backs of lowincome americans and the programs which serve them certainly this policy path and bill should be rejected to add insult to injury this spending measure makes no effort to reconcile the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars of rescinded section 8 moneys that have been usurped for emergency spending this year and the last this year for example we lost 350 million in section 8 that is made up if at all on the backs of other critical housing programs like the cdbg block grant which serves low and moderateincome folks in cities across the country while the committee may claim inadequate appropriation authority under the budget the fact is that there are 215 earmarks spending money on special interest projects the conclusion of this bill is to deny funding for housing and other needs but to buy off votes to pass it with projects and earmarked funds i am concerned regarding the cut in funding for the community development financial institutions cdfi fund as the sponsor of the bill to maintain and improve the cdfi fund which has been reported by the banking committee i think it would be more appropriate to keep the funding for the program at 95 million instead of what the committee provided through this bill a reduction of 25 million this underfunding is even more serious if we are to be able to have the running room to adequately fund the prime program that the banking committee has also reported out"], [3.6013950648339232e-06,

strengthen and make our schools safef we want to strengthen social security by locking away 100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty once and for all let us make the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the centerpiece of this years tax cut"], [4.410743713378906e-06,

workers atomic veterans and those who were exposed to fallout from atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in 1990 congress first accepted responsibility for the cancers caused by exposure to radioactive materials from our nuclear programs the radiation exposure compensation act reca provided payments to individuals who suffered from diseases as a result of their exposure to radiation in connection with the federal governments nuclear weapons program although the original legislation was a good first step the existing compensation program has proven to place an additional burden on the radiation victims progress on implementing reca has been impeded by criteria for compensation that is far more stringent than for other groups for which compensation is provided these brave workers were essential to our national security efforts the unitedstates atomic energy commission was the sole purchaser of the uranium ore and knew in the early 1950s that levels of radon and uranium dust in the mines were unhealthy we also knew atmospheric fallout was dangerous these brave people the uranium miners millers and transporters and the downwinders were used as atomic guinea pigs the united states owes a debt of gratitude to the workers and their families who unknowingly sacrificed their health to help win the cold war i have listened to many of these victims who have bravely fought their cancers and the unitedstates government for justice the senate bill addresses some not all concerns with the current reca program mr hatchs bill revises reca in the following ways includes residents of areas where atmospheric nuclear testing was conducted streamlines current payments schedules by requiring the government to pay compensation to eligible victims within six weeks authorizes a grant program to provide for the early detection prevention and education of diseases caused by radiation exposure expands coverage to include uranium millers in addition to miners expands current criteria for victims of radiation exposure to include a wider variety of covered cancers although i support these improvements the bill i introduced in the house last year would have done much more to provide justice for the victims of radiationinduced diseases the bill we are voting on today must be accepted or rejected in total without any amendments as the judiciary committee stated at their markup of the bill reca is a work in progress therefore in order to ensure immediate and badly needed improvements in the reca program i support the senate bill however we all agree and recognize that improvements need to be made to the radiation exposure compensation act i am especially concerned that uranium workers employed between 1971 to 1990 are not covered under this bill nor under current law and that the level of compensation remains at 100 000 my bill would have increased compensation to 200 000 which more fairly covers the medical expenses hardships and lost income to the victims my bill also contained provisions to address victims of experiments who were exposed to radiation without their consent and would have shifted the burden of proof off the victims onto the government other changes in my bill would have removed the smoking distinction and included workers exposed after 1971 especially important was the requirement to take into consideration and incorporate to the fullest extend feasible the compensation claims process for navajo claimants to conform to navajo law tradition and customs for example claims should be based on traditional ties of

start that i very much appreciate the cooperation of the gentleman from new jersey and his staff for working with the minority in shaping this legislation i do not oppose the minor changes that have been made in the bill since it was reported by the committee on resources certainly the bill falls short of what i think could be done to strengthen and protect the coastal barrier resources system nonetheless i believe we have effectively eliminated the most problematic provisions to arrive at a fair consensus and i urge members of this body to support the bill this legislation would reauthorize the coastal barrier resources act when congress passed the coastal barriers act in 1982 it declared that the purpose of the act was to and i quote minimize loss of life wasteful expenditure of federal revenues and the damage to fish wildlife and other natural resources associated with coastal barriers by restricting future federal expenditures and financial assistance which have the effect of encouraging development of coastal barriers this innovative policy has made good sense since 1982 and it continues to make good sense even today hurricane floyd as we have recently seen again demonstrates the wisdom and benefits of discouraging development in some of the most dangerous hazardprone coastal areas of our nation most importantly this legislation will begin the long overdue process of modernizing coastal barrier resource system maps section 5 of this bill would direct the secretary of the interior to conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility and costs of creating a digitized series of coastal barrier maps current maps were prepared in the 1980s by using primarily color infrared aerial photography and unitedstates geological survey quadrangle sheets handrendered delineations of coastal barriers were drawn upon these sheets in order to produce the inventory of coastal barrier maps however major technological advancements such as the new digital spatial data global positioning systems computerized geographic information systems and the new cartographic and survey methods make far greater detail and accuracy now possible it is essential for the fish and wildlife service to investigate how these new information systems and mapping technologies might enhance the accuracy usability and transferability of existing coastal barrier maps we will be looking for the fish and wildlife service to expedite completion of this pilot study as soon as possible i am however disappointed that we were not able to consider more creative ways to increase the amount of undeveloped coastal barriers in the system and i suspect that the congress will have to revisit this matter at a later time this legislation does authorize the voluntary donation of private property for inclusion in the system however it remains doubtful that any significant tracts of additional private land will be forthcoming in the absence of any new inducements to encourage donations nevertheless we encourage the fish and wildlife service to pursue aggressively opportunities for donations should they become available i am also compelled to express my sense of concern with the inability of the fish and wildlife service to complete and submit to the congress a study of undeveloped coastal barriers along the pacific coast the secretary of the interior was directed in 1990 under section 6 of the coastal barrier improvement act to prepare and submit a study which examines the need for protecting undeveloped coastal barriers along the pacific coast south of 49 degrees north latitude through inclusion in the system the secretary of the interior was also directed to prepare maps identifying the boundaries of those undeveloped coastal barriers of the united states bordering the pacific ocean south of 49 degrees north latitude all deliverables were to be provided to the congress not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of the 1990 law well the fish and wildlife service has failed to provide congress with either a final report or the maps this 8year delay is plainly unacceptable i am greatly concerned that the pace and growth of the new developments along the pacific coast may have significantly reduced the number of coastal areas that meet the section 31 definition of undeveloped coastal barrier i urge the fish and wildlife service to complete this directive as soon as possible finally i would be remiss if i did not restate the minoritys longstanding concern with the majoritys decision to include three other separate technical correction bills as section 6 7 and 8 in this reauthorization bill these provisions would change existing boundaries for three different otherwise protected areas in florida north carolina and delaware bills of this type are complicated certainly they are not technical corrections in the traditional sense all of the proposed boundary changes tacked on to this bill deserve close inspection prior to congressional approval i do appreciate the patience and willingness of the chairman to work with me and the staff on our side to ensure that these proposed changes are given appropriate scrutiny yet even today we are still awaiting additional information from the fish and wildlife service concerning the boundaries of a coastal barrier unit adjacent to the cape hatteras national seashore it is my understanding from the chairman that we will continue to work in good faith to resolve issues concerning this final boundary consequently we have agreed to move forward with this reauthorization bill at this time however should this boundary issue not be resolved to our satisfaction we do reserve our right to reconsider support of this legislation in conference should the senate successfully pass a companion bill i am hopeful that we will find an amicable agreement in this case but it will remain our preference that all boundary changes be addressed in separate

act a bill sponsored by the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from delaware it is a bipartisan bill aimed at giving greater flexibility to local schools to do their job the important job they do of educating our children during the past couple of months i have visited 10 or 12 schools in my district and visited the school districts there to sort of find out what they think of the federal role in education the federal role in education usually accounts for about 4 to 8 percent of the budgets of the average school district and i wanted to know if they thought that was helping the answer i got back was yes the money helps but there is too much red tape and there is too much regulation they want greater freedom so that they can exercise their skills and use the teachers and principals and parents and everybody involved in education on the local level there is too much federal red tape and the education flexibility act would target that red tape right now we have a pilot project that allows some 12 states in the country to take advantage of education flexibility this bill would expand it to all 50 states and what it would do is give local school districts the ability to get waivers from those federal regulations but the important thing about education flexibility is that it combines flexibility with accountability which is the way it ought to be done you can get the waiver the local school districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that we go further than the education flexibility act right now there is far too much red tape and far too many regulations in hundreds of different areas generated from the federal government that does not really help our local schools but only ties them in knots i do not want the people working in the schools in my community to spend all of their time filling out forms and justifying their existence to the federal government i want them to be educating the children there and doing the job that really matters right now far too often they are filling out the forms and trying to qualify for the money and continually justifying what they axe doing we need to change that we need to shift to local control from one end of this country to the other exciting things are going on in states and school districts they are making the reforms necessary they are moving towards accountability and right now the federal government is too big of a noose stopping them from making progress on that we need to make changes like the education flexibility act as a democrat i have always been a strong supporter of education and i support my fellow democrats in supporting spending the money necessary to help with education and supporting public education public education is responsible for over 90 percent of the children in this country getting educated it needs our support but we cannot simply spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best how to do it we need to make those changes so that we can have the world class public education system we need the education flexibility act that we introduce this week as i mentioned primarily sponsored by the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from delaware is a critical step i urge all of my colleagues to support edflex pass it as soon as possible and then go further to encourage

of this resolution although i do it with great reluctance because it is always difficult not to give the benefit of the doubt to the executive in foreign policy but 7 weeks ago i voted against authorizing unitedstates intervention in yugoslavia because i could discern no national interest in taking sides in a civil war no approach that would lead to a diminution of violence and no credible exit strategy i would like to stress above all one thing historical analogies are extremely difficult to derive i personally believe there are a whole lot that apply in the balkans but many of them are contradictory one that the majority side in support of the war falls back on is the holocaust i believe that there are holocaustal analogies but i also believe that milosevic is a sui generis war criminal one for whom holocaustal acts are not unknown but one where leadership is more analogous to say a ho chi minh or possibly even a pol pot than to a hitler i raise this because if we exclusively make hitlerite analogies we have no choice whatsoever than to follow a kind strategy that could lead in and of itself to greater losses of life to innocents than a negotiated settlement with each decision it appears that this administration and nato are moving into a circumstance where the problems are more difficult not less more likely to lead to outrageously violent results now is the time to stress negotiations the time to recognize that we are not likely to have a great victory senator alken once suggested in vietnam in the late 1960s that we should declare victory and get out that prescription does not fit the balkans but i would urge that we put in place a process of negotiations and with that process recognize we have a greater chance for a successful resolution than any other possibility little is more difficult than to apply perspective to the events of the day the administrations kosovo policy is open to question from two contrasting perspectives should we militarily engage the government of yugoslavia and if so what form should this engagement take the first question involves fundamental constitutional issues on war powers and the role of congress in legitimizing military action and enhancing the participation of the american people in decisions related to war and peace the second involves the unchallenged role of the president as commanderinchief and doctrines of warfare seven weeks ago i voted against authorizing unitedstates intervention in yugoslavia because i could discern no national interest in taking sides in a civil war in the balkans no approach that would lead to a diminution of violence and no credible exit strategy the administration through its acts and statements has broken with the military doctrine of the last several administrations particularly the reaganite reliance on peacetime military preparedness and the bush espousal of the powell doctrine which calls for the establishment and enunciation of clear objectives with the use of overwhelming force to achieve these objectives in this context i recently reviewed a 1984 speech of the former secretary of defense casper weinberger weinberger suggested that six major tests should be applied when we are weighing the use of unitedstates combat forces abroad 1 first the united states should not commit forces to combat overseas unless the particular engagement or occasion is deemed vital to our national interest or that of our allies 2 second if we decide it is necessary to put combat troops into a given situation we should do so wholeheartedly and with the clear intention of winning if we are unwilling to commit the forces or resources necessary to achieve our objectives we should not commit them at all 3 third if we do decide to commit forces to combat overseas we should have clearly defined political and military objectives and we should know precisely how our forces can accomplish those clearly defined objectives and we should have and send the forces needed to do just that as clausewitz wrote no one starts a waror rather no one in his senses ought to do sowithout first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it 4 fourth the relationship between our objectives and the forces we have committedtheir size composition and dispositionmust be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary conditions and objectives invariably change during the course of a conflict when they do change then so must our combat requirements we must continuously keep as a beacon light before us the basic questions is this conflict in our national interest does our national interest require us to fight to use force of arms if the answers are yes then we must win if the answers are no then we should not be in combat 5 fifth before the unitedstates commits combat forces abroad there must be some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the american people and their elected representatives in congress 6 finally the commitment of unitedstates forces to combat should be a last resort americans are obligated to assess whether unitedstates policy in kosovo today meet the above tests in terms of implementation the grenada interventionas minor an issue as it may have been and the gulf war which involved far greater geoeconomic stakes than the kosovo conflict stand in stark contrast with the new clinton military doctrine which can be described as 1 reliance on aircraft and missiles to rain destruction from thousands of feet and in some cases hundreds of miles in such farflung parts of the globe as east africa afghanistan and now serbia from an american perspective this use of air power is starwars like but from the perspective of targeted populations such as in belgrade the effect bears more resemblance to the bombings of world war i1 2 the declared renunciation of the use of ground troops amounts to the articulation that the united states intends to engage in kosovo with one hand tied behind its back 1 3 the determination that murderous potentates should be held in check through the destruction of significant civilian as well as military targets including electric utilities water systems political headquarters tv stations and residencies of heads of states 4 the use of a defensive alliance for intervention in a civil war 5 placing the prestige and might of the united states on the line through the commitment of air power while multilateralizing the decisionmaking and control in the nato structure which functions by consensus the lessons of history have been widely invoked both to justify and to decry our military intervention in kosovo unfortunately history does not provide easy answers either with regard to the meaning of contemporary events or to what actions should be taken in response to them for instance in the wake of world war i historians and political scientists rightly concluded the european system had been too inflexible in 1914 a misapplication of this lesson however led a generation later to munich too much rigidity precipitated the first world war too little backbone encouraged hitlers aggression in the second world war ii involved a conflagration between nation states it also involved a conflagration withinthe holocaustand challenged civilized society not to allow a replication of such inhumanity to man the background of both world wars bears on american decisionmaking today clearly the onslaught against the ethnic albanians in kosovo that milosevic has unleashed has holocaust parallels on the other hand the ethnic cleansing the serbs have undertaken also has analogs with what croats bosnians and to a much lesser extent kosovars have attempted in the region milosevics barbarity would appear to lie somewhere between ho chi minhs assault on south vietnamese catholics and pol pots attempt to exterminate intellectuals the problem with equating milosevic exclusively with hitler instead of recognizing him as a sui generis war criminal is that it makes a negotiated settlement morally untenable and renders it impossible for the unitedstates to consider anything less than unconditional victory this is particularly dangerous when it is selfevident that a negotiated settlement is preferable to all sides over a protracted conflict hence it is key to understand that at this point kosovo is more a civil war with holocaustal elements than viceversa but if the war continues a complicating factor for maintaining nato unity in the face of serbian atrocities will in all likelihood be the wests ability to stomach kosovar countermeasures and the implications of ratcheting up air power the line between a terrorist and a nationalist freedom fighter is narrow as is the line between using force to stand up to atrocity and applying force in such a way that greater violence is precipitated yet another lesson of history regards the effectiveness of air power and strategic bombing as john kenneth galbraith who led a team that assessed the impact of allied air power in world war ii has noted bombing in coordination with the use of ground troops has generally proved effective but strategic bombing of cities often causes populaces to rally to domestic leadership no matter how malevolent here it must be noted that air power is different from what it was earlier in the century our arsenal now includes nuclear weapons of enormous destructive power as well as socalled smart bombs and missiles that can strike with surgical accuracy which greatly enhances our ability to limit danger to our armed forces and collateral damage to civilian areas the development of smart weapons however may have caused political leaders to be too tempted to use them without recognizing that the use of force anywhere at any time has ramifications which are not easily predictable and which not infrequently are counterproductive for instance our goal in using force against milosevic may be to undermine his political support but it would appear that to date we have ensconced his political strength while weakening the democracy movement which was profoundly proamerican in serbia and damaging the lives and livelihoods of ordinary serbs much of the world is not enamored of americas ability to rain destruction from afar we simply have no idea how deep and how long the effects of our air strikes and the targets we have chosen will last what we do know is that serbs point to a 14th century defeat as a rallying cry for their actions today what we do know is that the armenians believe that in 1919 they suffered the first holocaust of the century and turkish embassies to this day are susceptible to terrorist attacks because of the atrocities of the now defunct ottoman empire in the background of the predicament we are in is failed diplomacy where theodore roosevelt invoked a doctrine of speak softly but carry a big stick this administration has propounded a policy of threatening vigorously while refusing to make timely military deployments that might have averted conflict we have been backed into using air power not out of considerations of national interest but to ensure that the credibility of unitedstates political leadership was kept in tact we told milosevic we would use it if he did not agree to our preferred negotiating plan and he in effect called our hand in the background was a peace agreement which had the doubtful support of one side and no support from the more powerful party while the rambouillet accord might have met standards of american sensibility it clearly proved untenable for the activist parties in the region this fact should give pause to nato america in particular in this regard i have become increasingly frostian in my geopolitics good fences sometimes make good or at least better neighbors it would appear that despite the multiheritage example of sarajevo the people of the balkans will have to learn to live apart without war before they can live together in peace a century and threequarters ago an american president james monroe asserted a doctrine that carries his name which established that the united states would object to further european colonization in this hemisphere and give succor to independence movements in latin america implicit in the monroe doctrine was the assumption growing from the concerns of our first president george washington a military man that the united states should not become entangled in the quarrels of europe with the exception of two world wars in this century and a commitment made in the context of the cold war of a defensive alliance historical unitedstates foreign policy has been govemed by the precept that we would give umbrella protection to independence movements in the americas but refrain from military intervention in the internal affairs of nation states on the continent our country was formed by dissidents and opportunity seekers reacting to the repression and civil wars in europe it now appears that our fore fathers better understood the balkans and like european problems than the state department does today at this point we are being asked to support nato action for the sake of the viability and credibility of the alliance rather than for the purposes for which the alliance was formed we appear to be putting the alliance ahead of our objectives and allowing our mutual strategy to test the alliance itself which it is doing one poll has found that 95 percent of greeks object to the nato bombing of yugoslavia and there are significant percentages albeit smaller opposed in every country of the alliance including the united states a decade or so ago i participated in a forum at the library of congress with former secretary of state henry kissinger at which i asked him about an observation he made in one of his autobiographical works kissinger had written that between the 1968 election and the inauguration he had sat down with presidentelect nixon and the two of them had decided to get the united states out of vietnam i asked why they had not just gone ahead and done that immediately upon taking office and kissinger responded congressman we meant we would get out with honor asked if that meant further escalation of troop numbers and bombing kissinger responded absolutely it is my sense that nato is in a similar position today with regard to belgrade for the honor of nato it appears that we are about to escalate the war the question is whether we are not better off seeking the earliest possible settlement history is a source of lessons and perspecfives but issues of the moment must also be approached in a manner which calculates their future implications natos strategic rationale appears to have broken down on the issue of numbers there are 19 states versus one with that one being much smaller than most of the 19 but another way of looking at this strategic conundrum is that 19 countries are allied against the forces of nationalism and subnationalism in a part of the world where historical and ethnic tensions provide little basis for compromise nationalism led to dramatic changes in the worlds map in the 19th century and has been repeatedly underestimated as a force in the 20th century the question is will nato despite its might find itself in the same position in the balkans as the united states did in vietnam and as the soviet union did in afghanistan returning to history the first great chronicle of the western world relates to a land mass adjoining the balkans ancient greece thucydides wrote that early in the peloponnesian wars which pitted the quasidemocratic and enormously uplifting culture of ancient athens against the more militaristic sparta the athenian assembly voted to send a navalfleet to conquer the neutral island of melos several days later the decision was reconsidered and a faster ship was sent to overtake the fleet and call off the invasion later in the war however the athenian assembly again decided to invade melos and sent out a force which killed all the men and enslaved the women on the island thucydides chronicles were intended to show how the worlds most civilized citystate at the time had lost its way and indeed from that point on athens never again recovered its prior status an aspect of the bombing today is what targets are left in serbia after so much damage has already been inflicted clearly at this point the serbs have lost virtually everything except the war while the west has won nothing particularly a peace a case can be made that whatever mistakes have been made to date it is morally questionable to stand by and do nothing and an even greater mistake to pull the rug out from under the executive branch the reason i cannot support americas continuing military role is that each of the choices for nato in the future gets more untenable there is the prospect of sending in troops with losses potentially equivalent to or greater than vietnam there is also the prospect of ratcheting up the air war one can always strike again at military sites but it appears that on the civilian side yugoslavia has already been bombed back to the 18th century military historians counsel two principles when devising strategic doctrine put on the shoes of opponents and do not back them hopelessly into a comer in the case of kosovo we clearly have not put on the shoei of the serbs and we have done everything to back milosevic into a comer we have made a martyr out of a murderer and allowed a war criminal to stand up to nato which includes serbias ancient enemy turkey milosevics martyrdom increases with each degree of the suffering of his people every society has an historian or philosopher who points out that the road to hell is paved with good intentions despite the good intentions of the west our policies appear to be counterproductive ratcheting up the war could well signify a ratchetingdown of the moral high ground of nato the prerequisite of policy must always be good intentions but good intentions are insufficient grounds for action policy must match intentions with practical capacities to carry out defined objectives just war doctrines after all require that responses be proportional and effective the only alternatives to a bombs only policy are the introduction of ground troops or the isolation of serbia the reliance on a humanitarian response to a humanitarian crisis in either case the legal and moral imperative to indict serb leadership for war crimes is overwhelming in the late 1960s senator aiken suggested we simply declare victory and get out of vietnam this prescription does not fit todays dilemma in the balkans but our first obligation should be to put in place a process of negotiations with the understanding that an imperfectly negotiated settlement may be the closest thing to victory that is likely to be possible without the loss of an incalculable number of innocents escalating the war on the other hand puts unitedstates interests at risk in the balkans and in other parts of the world the earlier we reconsider the better the vote on this resolution and the others we will take today are necessitated by law that law the war powers resolution may be unconstitutional and todays votes may serve as a basis for the courts to rule to this effect nonetheless the war powers resolution is at this moment the law of the land ironically we are finding compliance may be more difficult for the legislative than as has generally been perceived for the executive branch because it forces congressional accountability for or against executive actions more importantly the timing as well as the fact of consideration of these resolutions is awkward for the national interest because legislative decisionmaking is required by dates certain i e within a prescribed period from the time troops are deployed in hostile circumstances the public interest may not be well served by such a review of executive action in such a timeframe but it would be less well served i congress avoided its legal and constitutional responsibilities hence what in effect is a legislative executive confrontation is legally at this time unavoidable and as an individual member of congress i have no option except to take a stand this stand is one of dissent to what i consider to be a foreign policy that lacks intellectual rigor and misserves the national interest"], [0.9995316565036774, 0.00046834349632263184, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i also rise in support of

branch treasurypostal conference report this miniomnibus appropriations bill is business as usual and i did not come to congress to engage in business as usual the people of kansas third district expect and deserve more of us as congress has done for too many years today it will be voting on a bill that violates both the rules of the house and the senate in the name of political expediency under these rules congress is supposed to consider 13 appropriations bills for each fiscal year under normal procedures those bills should come before the house and the senate individually with opportunities for amendment and debate after a conference report is negotiated the house should then have the opportunity to vote on each bill standing alone unfortunately congress has refused to follow its own rules the majority party has combined two appropriations bills in this socalled conference reportone of which has yet to be considered by the full senate i have only been a member of this body for 18 months but i understand that these rules and procedures were put in place to protect the rights of all members to represent fully the interests and concerns of our constituents we cannot do so when we are confronted with an omnibus conference report which rolls together a number of provisions that one of our two deliberative bodies has not had the opportunity to fully consider while the process under which this bill has been considered is unacceptable it does contain many programs which i have fought for and for which i would vote under normal circumstances i am pleased that this bill contains provisions that strongly support law enforcement efforts in this country fully funding the administrations gunlawenforcement initiatives including a proposal to add 600 employees to the agency to more fully enforce existing gun laws suggests that this congress is finally getting serious about stopping the scourge of gun crimes that have crippled this nation this bill also contains a provision that i strongly support which would roll back the 0 5 percent surcharge on federal employee retirement contributions this increase was mandated by the 1997 balanced budget law and has disproportionately affected federal employees by taxing more of their gross income for retirement than their private sector counterparts contribute the budget is balanced it is time to stop funding surpluses at the expense of our hard working federal employees finally i strongly support the provision in this bill that would repeal the 3 percent telephone excise tax that was levied as a luxury tax over 100 years ago to fund the spanish american war the war is over and with over 94 percent telephone ownership this service is no longer a luxury it is past time to repeal this tax and i voted to do so back in may when the house first considered this issue i am disappointed that the majority party chose to hold this important issue hostage by marrying it with this controversial measure while i support many of the priorities in this bill i remain concerned about one provision in this bill that suggest this congress is not serious about holding the line on spending about a decade ago through legislative slight of hand congress passed a law to allow for the automatic annual increase in members salaries this was a politically motivated move to shield congress from casting embarrassing votes to increase their own pay while we were technically afforded the opportunity to vote against an increase by casting a no vote on a procedural issue the fact remains that by voting in support of this legislation we will be voting for our own pay raises this will be a vote that comes at the expense of other mandates an earlier congress created two years ago the house voted overwhelmingly for the irs reform and restructuring act which followed recommendations of a commission that studied the irs and stated that irs budgets should receive stable funding for the next three years so that the leaders can improve taxpayer service and compliance this bill contrary to the recommendations of a bipartisan commission and contrary to the will of this house cuts 465 million from the administrations request if this congress is serious about holding the line on spending we would not hold our other priorities hostage to our desires of a larger paycheck i willbe voting against this bill and i will be voting against a pay increasei urge my colleagues to put their money where their mouth is and reject final passage of this legislation"], [0.002195000648498535,

allow refugee camps to turn into death camps due to poor sanitation the spread of disease and the lack of food and shelter i support a massive humanitarian response to this crisis the unitedstates should do whatever it takes to bring food medicine and shelter to the refugees and i support efforts by the united states and other countries to admit any refugees seeking asylum but i am afraid that is not nearly enough we have a moral obligation to protect the internally displaced ethnic albanians within kosovo those who have not yet been slaughtered must be protected we must not allow them to suffer the same fate as so many other kosovars unfortunately we did not act soon enough to address the murderous actions by serbia and today thousands of people are dead because of international indifference we ought to create safe havens for ethnic albanians inside of kosovoand we ought to do it as soon as we can this would prevent further expulsions and mass killings this will not be easy and will not be without a loss of lives but it must be done we cannot allow the leader of one nation to wipe out an entire ethnic group at the end of world war ii and the holocaust the world made a collective promise to all future people we said never again we ought to mean it however it is unlikely at this point that air strikes alone will bring an end to this conflict we ought to consider other options including the use of ground forces we now have to be prepared to forcefully enter kosovo and occupy the area in order to make the safe return of refugees possible this is not a task that

the gentleman for yielding this time to me and thank him for his leadership on the committee in trying to strengthen this supplemental bill i also want to congratulate the new chairman of the committee who has tried hard to put a bill together but i must say to my colleagues it is truly inadequate certainly from the standpoint of agriculture americas farmers are in crisis this bill should have been up here two months ago we have been witnessing price declines at record levels across this country with an additional income drop for our farmers this year of over 20 percent this house bill falls so far short of the mark though it contains much needed credit authority to help farmers over this spring planting period it is too little too late as we stand here equipmerit auctions are going on across the country bankruptcies mount and people cannot move product to market one of the most curious aspects of this particular measure is that one of the budget offsets in the bill is to reduce the p l 480 program which is a program at the department of agriculture where we take surplus which we have plenty of on this market and move it into foreign markets to help hungry people around the world and there are certainly lots of those but also to help our farmers here at home get out from under the weight of all this production which is helping prices to continue to plummet here in the domestic market so we should have been able to perfect a more perfect bill unfortunately this is not the one i wanted to mention that the bill contains some very important language that has to do with the russian food aid package that is currently being delivered over a billion dollars of russian food aid and yet very few checks by the government of the united states in order to assure that that product is not diverted and graft does not occur i include for the record questions that we should ask the executive branch and expand congressional oversight of that russian food aid package as it

states have already exhausted their loan funds and farmers cannot get their crops in the ground without the credit to purchase their inputs usda reports that the farm service agency will begin to layoff temporary employees at the end of this week these employees assist with the backlog in delivering assistance to farmers suffering from low prices and crop disasters the demand for loan

us to make sure that we do not violate the first amendment this is an urging kind of thing and it might be too broad for my colleague but maybe we should come back and do it as a freestanding
