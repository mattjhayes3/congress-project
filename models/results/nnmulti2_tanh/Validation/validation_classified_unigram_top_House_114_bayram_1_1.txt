mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for

appreciate the opportunity to discuss an issue that is very personal to me before i begin i just want to say that my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims of the horrible tragedy in orlando and i can only imagine what they are going through the other thing that is illuminating to me is that as we came here and stood up for a moment of silence after that moment of silence i believe members were given a 1minute opportunity to speak on any topic that they would like to on the floor as is customary and not one person from the other side of the aisle mentioned what happened in orlando so not only was it a moment of silence for the leadership in this house but it appears that it is going to be a moment that remains silent or a topic that remains silent from the other side of the aisle eliminating racialbased health disparities depends on our ability to advance access to affordable health care for all even in the 21st century health disparities are stark especially in the african american communities where life expectancies are lower and infant mortality rates are higher than among whites today despite improvement in overall health in the united states african americans and other minority populations lag behind in numerous health areas including access to quality care timelines of care and health outcomes for years the congressional black caucus has called on republicans to join us and other house democrats in developing a plan to eliminate racial health disparities a plan that addresses the causes of health disparities such as inequities in environmental social and economic conditions in our communities instead we get from them proposals like their socalled a better way poverty proposal a stale repackaging of failed policies presented under the guise of concern about americans trapped in poverty cutting job training programs food assistance and head start will push lowincome americans further into poverty making it even more difficult for them to access the affordable and quality health care needed to secure their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families we need to instead use the government as a source of good every american deserves to live in a safe and healthy environment yet lowincome and minority communities are much more exposed to high levels of pollution resulting in serious health problems such as asthma heart problems and cancer this is a very real problem across america a very real problem in my district thirteen million people including 3 5 million children are concentrated in the vicinity of transportation facilities and are exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution my district is home to the port newarkelizabeth marine terminal part of the port of new york and new jersey the third largest port in the country according to the epa 25 percent of children in newark suffer from asthmathree times the state average what we need are additional federal actions to reduce harmful air pollution from ports and congested components of the national freight transportation system the issue is critical to the lowincome and minority community who suffer the disproportionately adverse health effects of these environmental hazards now since i am on the topic of environmental justice i just want to remind everyone that the republicans continue to block any action to help the thousands of children facing lifelong damage from drinking poisoned water in flint including a vote to block the families of flint act emergency supplemental their radical refusal to address this health issue will have tragic consequences for american families and i think it is representative of their overall inadequate approach to health disparities in minority communities the way to eliminate racial health disparities is neither to downplay them nor to cut programs that will assist the most vulnerable it is to address the environmental social and economic conditions that exacerbate those disparities it is to expand access to quality health care that could eliminate or reduce the onset of many of these chronic illnesses and disproportionate health outcomes it is to maintain and strengthen our investments in healthcare access and resources for disadvantaged populations in closing i also want to stress that health education must also be a focus in any efforts to eliminate racialbased health disparities african americans and other communities are disproportionately affected by poor providerpatient communication and health literacy issues consequently they often do not have access to information that enables them to make the appropriate health decisions we have a responsibility to work with our healthcare institutions and community health centers to make it easier for people to find understand and use the information and services as cochair of the congressional mens health caucus i have hosted and participated in a number of outreach events in my

this loophole and require a background check for all commercial gun sales including those online at gun shows and through classified ads background checks are our first line of defense when it comes to stopping dangerous people from getting firearms we know that they work every day 170 felons are stopped from buying a gun because of a background check and 50 domestic abusers are stopped from

transparency of their nuclear activities it is clear to me as well as to numerous nuclear diplomatic and national security experts around the globe that this agreement achieves these critical goals it not only cuts off all pathways to a nuclear weapon but it also imposes unprecedented and permanent inspections and it ensures we can automatically reinstate international sanctions if iran violates the agreement in contrast defeating this deal would allow iran to resume its nuclear program with no restrictions or oversight increasing the likelihood of military conflict and a regional nuclear

time after time after time in our history those tax cuts for the rich have caused an explosion in our deficit this rules package would have us believe that up is down and left is right second this

committee has that authority i served as a staff member in this house for the late congressman joe moakley our staff members are dedicated public servants who work incredibly hard but this provision

there is no question about that we are here because we are outraged we are outraged at republican attempts to undermine our child nutrition programs we are outraged at their lousy child reauthorization bill it is a terrible terrible terrible bill my friends should be ashamed of this bill a nutritious school meal is just as important to a childs success in school as a textbook hungry children cant concentrate they cant focus on their studies in short hungry children cannot learn that is a fact everybody knows that yet we have a bill that my republican friends have drafted that will increase hunger and that will actually take food out of the mouths of children it is outrageous together our child nutrition programs wic school breakfast and lunch the summer food service program and the child and adult care food program provide nutritional support for children year round in places where they live learn and play unfortunately h r 5003 which is the republican reauthorization bill includes a number of harmful provisions that would roll back years of progress and hamper the ability of children to access healthy meals as i said to be very blunt it makes hunger worse in this country specifically the bill would undermine the successful community eligibility provision which some of my colleagues have talked about first included in the last reauthorization bill that has allowed highpoverty school districts to offer universal school meals to all students in its first 2 years cep helped more than 8 5 million lowincome students access free meals instead of building on the success of this program my republican friends would severely restrict schools eligibility for the community eligibility option the center on budget and policy priorities estimates that 7 022 schools currently using community eligibility would lose it under this republican bill and another 11 647 schools that qualify for community eligibility but who have not yet adopted it would be prevented from doing so in the future as we approach the summer months it is also important to remember that child hunger gets worse in the summer consider this for every six children who get a lunch in school each day only one receives a meal in the summertime instead of being a carefree time for children who depend on getting healthy reliable meals during the school year the summer months can be a time of stress anxiety and hunger but it doesnt have to be this way unfortunately this republican bill cuts the successful summer ebt pilot program which provides a temporary boost in food assistance benefits during the summer months for families whose children receive free school meals during the school year and it fails to make necessary investments to expand the reach of summer food service programs so that more kids have access to healthy summer meals in their neighborhoods in addition this bill rolls back as my colleagues have mentioned evidencebased standards that make school meals healthier usda estimates that more than 90 percent of schools have successfullyhave successfullyimplemented these standards my grandmother used to say to me when i was growing up that an apple a day keeps the doctor away i wish she was still alive so i could tell her she was right food is medicine when we eat good food we eat nutritious food we tend to have healthy lives if you eat bad food if you eat junk food then you end up getting health issues like diabetes like high blood pressure and like obesity i could go on and on and on why in the world would anybody want to lower the nutrition standards in our school meals to give our kids junkier less nutritious food what sense does that make if my colleagues who are advocating these reversals of smart policy are doing so only because they want to save a few dollars then let me tell you something you are saving nothing if we dont get this right if we dont insist that our kids have access to nutritious healthier food the medical costs associated with the health challenges that they will experience are astronomical as my colleague from wisconsin mentioned earlier hundreds of billions of dollars in avoidable healthcare costs as a result of children not having access to good food 15 million children face hunger in this country instead of undoing the success we have already achieved congress should be focused on ways we can strengthen these vital child nutrition programs let me say finally it is hard for me to understand why we have to be here today why everything is a fight when it comes to dealing with issues of hunger and when it comes to dealing with issues and making sure our kids get access to good nutrition it is always a fight it is always a fight to protect so many vital food and nutrition programs that help our kids there is either a shocking ignorance about the reality of the poverty that millions of our children face in this country or there is simply indifference those are the only two ways i can explain what is going on in this chamber whichever one it is it is a sad excuse for what my republican friends are trying to do lets come together this should be a bipartisan issue there was a time when fighting hunger and when making sure that our kids had access to nutritious food was a bipartisan issue george mcgovern and bob dole worked together in the 1970s to strengthen our food and nutrition programs but now in this chamber these issues have become controversial it is sad because there are a lot of people in this country who are depending on us to find ways to end hunger in america they are depending on us to make sure that their kids when they go to school have access to nutritious food and that they have access to nutritious food during the summer

something like this allowing the navy and the answer is yes this has happened private entities in both hoosick new york and west virginia have worked through state authorities to enable there to be testing of thousands of local residents in situations like this to determine whether or not there could have been any local impact due to that so we are not asking the defense department to put any kind of man hours into this we are asking them to work with what we believe are appropriate authorities that already exist and for them to work in publicprivate partnerships with state entities to enable and facilitate some of this testing to take place i think the navy deserves credit for being proactive in the way they have looked at this issue but we see this as a continuing obligation and

114th congress i am thrilled to have her partnership in this caucus and i look forward to working with her several years ago my good friend and former republican colleague from missouri jo ann emerson and i founded the house hunger caucus as a forum for members to discuss advance engage and work on issues related to domestic and international hunger and food insecurity over the years the house hunger caucus has hosted a number of briefings on topics ranging from introductions to the major domestic and international hunger programs to food deserts in rural and urban america to global agriculture and farmertofarmer initiatives to international school feeding and child nutrition programs just to name a few the caucus doesnt just look at existing programs it also gets involved in emergency responses as they are unfolding in 2011 during one of the worst droughts in recent memory the house hunger caucus held timely briefings on the unitedstates response to the famine in the horn of africa members and staff were able to hear directly from those on the ground providing assistance to deal with this unprecedented crisis one of the most important objectives of the house hunger caucus is to foster better communication among antihunger advocates by bringing together stakeholders from federal agencies state and local governments nonprofits faithbased organizations academia and business to discuss longterm strategies for ending hunger the caucus also serves as a vehicle for antihunger organizations to communicate directly to congress about hunger and food insecurity issues one of my top priorities for the house hunger caucus this year is to make sure we hear directly from those who have experienced hunger and poverty firsthand we need to make sure that their voices are heard in the discussions here in washington one of the greatest assets of the house hunger caucus is that it is bipartisanrepublicans and democrats it is a way for members to come together to work to end hunger there is not a congressional district in the united states of america that is hungerfree not a single one according to the usda more than 17 5 million american households were food insecure in 2013 meaning that their access to adequate food was limited by a lack of money or other resources 5 6 percent of households were considered to have very low food security in other words those households were hungry hunger disproportionately affects the most vulnerable among us children seniors and the disabled last year 16 million children or one in five experienced hunger and increasingly veterans and military families are experiencing hunger on the international side about 805 million people in the world or one in nine suffer from hunger according to the most recent u n reports this is a decrease of 100 million over the past decade and 209 million since the early 1990s the unitedstates can be proud of its leadership in reducing global hunger and addressing the root causes of food insecurity through partnerships with other nations international organizations our own farmers ngos and private sector communities we are advancing agricultural development increasing child nutrition reducing malnutrition among infants and children empowering small farmers around the globe especially women and providing nutritious meals in school settings while the journey is long we now have a

aisle members recognized him and they started spontaneously democrats and republicans alike to applaud jim oberstar by the time he got to the well the whole house was engaged in this spontaneous bipartisan genuine loving and appreciative applause for jim oberstar i quite frankly have never seen anything like it i hope to see a lot more things like it in the days to come but what a remarkable moment that was it was a real genuine spirit of affection for someone who worked really hard knew his material as well or better than anyone and was such a good nonpartisan when it came to what is good for america i have never quite seen anything like it jim received more honors than he could count in life quite frankly he received even more in his passing but i think it is safe to say that no honor would please him more than being recognized by his colleagues in the hometown of chisholm where jim grew up chisholm on minnesotas iron range is where he learned the value of ideas as a star on his high school debate team they say he was a pretty good football player too but he liked to recall that the editor of his hometown said to him on a couple of occasions jim you are a really good debater you really know how to argue you might want to keep working at that and how fitting that he would end up in the congress of the united states it is also in chisholm where he learned about public service with his first working job for that editor peddling papers to the miners and to the mining families and learning about the politics of the community it is also where he learned hard work from his parents jims dad worked in the mines his entire life and hardly ever missed a days work chisholm is also the place where jim learned those oldfashioned values that brought him to the house of representatives he believed that a good idea was a good idea and it didnt matter if it was a republican idea or a democratic idea all that mattered was that someone had offered the idea and he had such enormous respect for the process and for his colleagues that he gave every good idea an open an honest and a fair hearing and if it turned out to be something good for the nation why it

has thrived over that century gsa has supported its evolution by providing a backbone of stability relied upon by exporters shippers farmers and of course consumers with the farm economy and so many of our constituents relying on the ability of grain and oilseeds to get to market it is critical that we act to provide stability for the grain trade like we are doing here today this legislation

inspections process therefore congress should not delay in passing its reauthorization the house is getting its job done well ahead of schedule by considering this bill today and i hope my colleagues

earlier by the chairman last summer the washington state department of agriculture discontinued its export inspections amid an ongoing labor dispute since labor disputes do happen from time to time this kind of situation was anticipated by our predecessors which is why current law provides a mechanism for usda to step in and provide inspection services in the event of a disruption however the dispute devolved into a political situation in which the secretary of agriculture declined to use his discretionary authority to maintain inspections while inspection services were eventually restored it is critical we avoid a repeat of that unfortunate decision fortunately the agriculture committee arrived at a bipartisan consensus and found a way to avoid any future disruptions to the grain trade

recipients of a broad distribution of voting company stock so long as that stock is held for a specified amount of time specifically when an employer makes an acrosstheboard distribution of voting stock the value of the grant would not be counted as an employees taxable income provided that the same number of shares is granted to every employee and the stock is held for five years if held for ten years employee stockholders can begin to sell or exchange a portion of their stock for other similarlypriced stock free of capital gains thus after 20 years the stock would be totally tax free the provisions of this bill are carefully crafted to allow for the empowerment of employees and the diversification of an employees portfolio the phasein of the capitalgainsfree treatment is meant to
