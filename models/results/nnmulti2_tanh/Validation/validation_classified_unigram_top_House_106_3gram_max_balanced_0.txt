and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because it is the right thing to do so again i urge a yes vote i invite every democrat to join with republicans let us vote to eliminate the marriage

dollars was lost through waste fraud and abuse in the federal government each year as chairman of the results caucus a bipartisan team of members focused on ridding our federal government of its major management problems i have seen report after report which has focused on insufficient and inefficient financial management systems that fail to produce consistent and reliable data in fact the general accounting office in a report issued in january of this year gave details about the department of defenses accounting system it reported that over 9 billion in known military operating materials and supplies were not reported that same defense department did not have reliable information on important items of inventory including the number and location of military equipment items such as f4 engines and service craft the cfo act was designed to improve financial management and to coordinate internal controls and financial accounting chief financial officers oversee all financial management activities in their agencies and report directly to the head of an agency on financial matters it certainly is clear that such practices are needed in the white house this legislation fixes a4 oversight in the original cfo act unfortunately the original act never applied to the executive office of the president h r 437 the presidential and executive office accountability act of 1999 will do so in a way that recognizes that unique circumstances of that office exist it will establish a chief financial officer in the executive offices of the president and will review and audit the white houses financial systems and its records the cfo duties are to comply with those requirements set forth in the cfo act but is limited by discretion of the president when the annual fiscal report on the federal government was recently released the government accounting office told us that significant financial system weaknesses problems with fundamental record keeping incomplete documentation and weak internal controls including computer reports prevent thb government from accurately reporting a large portion of its assets liabilities and costs in other words this administration cannot tell you how much money it receives how much money it spends and what it spends its money on what property it owns where that property goes or how much that property is worth there is no evidence that the executive offices at the white house are any different from those reports that have been issued already passage of this bill is another signal to the taxpayers that we will ferret out waste fraud and

security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty once and for all let us make the elimination of the

words i am pleased to be here today to speak out on this important subject there has been an ongoing lack of agreement between certain regions of the country on veterans and equitable funding this particular problem has been cleared up by congress we all know what the problems were before the mccain and graham bill that came up with this equitable formula and i say it is equitable because the model is composed or computed in such a way that the vas funding methodology is no longer based on traditional patterns it is based on an assessment of what is done there it is based on certain facets and it is tailored to the price index that reflects the unique characteristics of these particular areas so these veterans networks each of them has a separate and distinct characteristic and that is the background of the vera funding model the implementation of vera as we all know took place in 1997 halfway through the fiscal year everything was done to allocate resources in an equitable manner the networks were funded at approximately one half of the 1996 level plus a 2 75 percent increase for fiscal year 1998 13 visns received increases over funding levels for fiscal year 1997 nine networks received less funding as with the previous year a 5 percent limitation cap was imposed on the amount that any visn that any network could be reduced below 1997 levels so regardless of what we are hearing today not any of the visns have been hurt that tremendously so that we should not stick to our vera formula i am calling for a defeat of this amendment because the medical care appropriated budget which comes to this subcommittee for 1999 provides a modest increase over fiscal year 1998 to 220 million or 1 3 percent for the 1999 fiscal allocations the maximum amount maximum that any visn network was reduced below 1998 was again just 5 percent the va has emphasized that these networks receiving relatively fewer fundings will adjust and they will adjust because the money is going where the veterans are wherever the veterans go according to the vera formula that is where the money goes the older veterans come to florida not only florida that is one of the states they go but i am here to say that we have a good formula we do not need to change it because of traditional patterns it is not the fault of florida that the older veterans and the sicker veterans come to florida we are here today to say that the basic care of veterans is being taken care of adequately by the vera formula so is the complex care so is the geographic price adjustment there is a differential here that makes this adjustment fair to the northeast as well as the south and it is based on labor costs that is paid by the va facilities as they compare to the va national average these figures are not just pulled out of the sky there is that differential that is based upon labor costs also they make allocation adjustments for labor that is based on the most recent data that the va can put together so in 1999 it even looks better for vera in terms of adjusting the formula this vera formula is fair it is equitable it is based on substantive data it is not based on historical funding patterns as to who received the money 15 to 20 years ago it is not based on politics congress initiated this formula and 1 would like to say to my colleagues please defeat the

a lot of worthy causes advanced here by members today members wanting to increase funding in different accounts recognizing that in most of those instances the committee wanted to raise the money in those accounts but not being able to do so because of our skinny allocation the gentleman from colorados amendment is another worthy amendment state veterans homes are extremely important and as he points out the veterans population is aging and so they will become increasingly important so i want to first acknowledge the worthiness of the gentlemans amendment and its purpose let me first say that the committee recognized the importance of this program and increased the funding above the request i believe doubled it i think the gentleman indicated that from 40 to 80 million that is not enough it is not last years funding perhaps as the process goes forward this will be one of those accounts as we get more money that we can plus up but i mys4 say however wprthy the cause is the offsets are9 the worst i have seen today proposing to offset and the gentleman has reduced his offsets to two now offsetting the chemical safety and hazard investigation board by 2 million is a huge cut it is a 22 percent cut to the chemical safety and hazard investigation boards budget i had a letter last march from the chairman of this board this investigation board which investigates chemical accidents around the country suggesting that under its current spending levels that it probably would not be able to continue investigations through the end of the fiscal year this board as we need more money for state veterans homes the chemical safety and hazard investigation board needs even more money to do its job cutting it 22 percent would be the absolutely wrong thing to do this is an extremely important mission that the board fulfills it is having difficulty fulfilling it under its current spending rate and cutting it would be just disastrous and prevent it from being able to carry out its mission we do not want to do that and i am sure the gentleman from colorado does not want to do that the second offset the gentleman proposes is equally difficult it is an offset to epas inspector general account a 5 million cut which is a 12 percent cut to the inspector generals account now the inspector generals office is the office that is responsible for investigating waste fraud and abuse which i am sure the gentleman is very much against in agencies i am sure the gentleman wants inspector generals out there investigating the agencies to ensure that we do not have waste fraud and abuse and to ensure which is the other mission of the inspector general that the laws and regulations that epa is supposed to carry forward are carried forward properly this is a 12 percent cut to

fulfilling a congressionally mandated obligation that requires him to develop alternative procedures on class iii gaming compacts on april 12 1999 the secretary published proposed final regulations on class iii or casino style gaming procedures that allows the secretary to mediate differences between states and indian tribes and indian gaming activities these regulations are a long awaited development in the stalemate between indian tribes and certain states over class hi gaming the secretary developed the regulations because of the united states supreme court ruling in seminole tribe versus florida which found that states could avoid compliance with the indian gaming regulatory act by asserting immunity from suit by enacting igra congress did not intend to give states the ability to block the compacting process by inserting immunity from suit in fact igra enables the secretary to issue alternative procedures when the states refuse to ratify the compacts this is why the secretary is exercising authority to issue regulations governing class hi gaming with the states that refuse to negotiate in good faith the weldonbarr amendment would prohibit the secretary from fulfilling his obligations under igra on the grounds that it bypasses state authority nothing could be further from the truth the regulations would give great deference to the states role under igra only after a state asserts immunity from suit and refuses to negotiate would the regulations apply i think it is particularly important to note that the regulations would not give tribes a right to engage in gaming but only create a forum where all interests state federal and tribal can be determined the secretarys role would be subjeot to several safeguards including oversight by the federal courts in april one day after the secretary published the class hi gaming regulations the states of florida and alabama sued in the federal district court in florida claiming the regulations were beyond the scope of the secretarys authority under igra on may 11 1999 the secretary wrote to the house and senate committees on appropriations saying that he would refrain from implementing the regulations until the federal court has resolved the authority question we should not interfere in a matter currently under federal court review allowing the weldonbarr amendment to become law now would interfere in that process furthermore the interior appropriations bill is not the vehicle that should be used to debate the issues of class hi gaming regulations the committee on resources spent months and months writing igra and i helped write that bill the gentleman from illinois and the republican leadership are meeting today with several tribal leaders on their support of indian sovereignty how ironic it is that we are here today considering an amendment that would devastate our policy and laws promoting tribal sovereignty and indian selfdetermination downstairs they are

gentleman from new jersey for their primary sponsorship of this legislation i rise in strong support of this measure which enjoys strong bipartisan support it is also supported by the administration congressional oversight of policy in kosovo is remiss if it only looks at the inevitable problems that follow 40 years of communism 10 years of apartheid and 1 year of brutal armed aggression responsible oversight must also recognize achievements as well as goals for future progress after the nato victory the international community mobilized assistance that helped feed and house more than one million kosovo refugees before the first postwar winter the international mission in kosovo successfully negotiated an agreement with the kosovo liberation army to disband and publicly hand over its weapons although daily life in kosovo has significantly improved compared to the violence devastation and chaos that plagued the region during armed conflict a year ago more must be done to develop a selfsustaining economy that discourages the rise of criminal elements the european union must also continue to bear the primary responsibility and costs for the economic reconstruction of kosovo and take all necessary steps to ensure that its future budgets provide the required resources in a timely fashion the administration of all basic services such as police sanitation water telecommunications and electrical supply should be put into the hands of the people of kosovo at the earliest possible date the international peacekeeping force in mitrovica should take immediate measures to ensure that all the residents are able to return in security to their homes and most importantly all citizens of kosovo should follow the principles enunciated by community leaders at the airlie house declaration of july 23 of this year which included antiviolence representation of all citizens in local councils surrendering illegal weapons a commitment to counter slobodan milosevics influence in kosovo as well as dissolving any other illegitimate governing and security structures the winds of democratic change have swept through the region in recent days and months bringing in democratic reform in croatia and toppling slobodan milosevic from controlling serbia in the wake of these dramatic events the resolution before the house today supports greater progress towards

substantially more land acquisition we are going to have 35 million more people knocking on the doors of national parks in 10 years and we need to buy a lot more land in order to preserve it for posterity but i also support this amendment i am uncomfortable being here i do not like to oppose my friends and i do not like to be standing in the way of this legislation but i think there are some substantial problems with it the federal government has the responsibility to take care of our national parks and our national forests and our national wildlife refuges in dealing with national environmental priorities this bill takes almost 3 billion of national resources and locks them into a handful of projects many of them focused on dealing with state parks state forests and state priorities every year for the next 15 years that money is steered to acquisition of land to specific wildlife programs to coastal environmental projects those programs are good and i strongly support them but they are not the only priorities we have as a nation and they are not even the only priorities we have on the environmental front they are important to me but they are not any more important than is education or health care or some others i do not understand why we are taking federal money and using it to fund state priorities when many of our states have been running budget surpluses i did not come here to be my governors tax collector i came here to deal with responsibilities that could not be dealt with at any other level of government i simply do not believe in insulating even my favorite programs from congressional oversight for 5 years i believe in a much larger land acquisition program but i do not put land acquisition ahead of other priorities like education and health care i want to make it very clear i will work to the fullest extent of my ability to make land acquisition a much higher priority of this congress but i will not support the idea of making it an exclusive priority that is not fair to other environmental problems it is not fair to our other national obligations we sit here and see for instance that half of our national wildlife refuges have no staff i do not think that we should make it more difficult to correct that problem by something we do tonight on this bill i congratulate the gentleman for his amendment i think it is a responsible

matters related to our infrastructure as any staffer on thishill i want to thank her for all the efforts she has made i thank the gentleman from ohio the ranking member too for working very closely

and my colleague from montgomery county mrs morella for rising in support of this resolution we have obviously as the house of representatives responsibility for this hallowed hill this center of democracy in the world it is i think extraordinarily appropriate that for the last few number of years we have made available a part of this hill over which we have authority for an enterprise that has literally taught thousands and thousands of young people entrepreneurial spirit competitive spirit family working together because although those young people are responsible for building their carts they do get some advice from and counsel from dad and mom and brothers and sisters from time to time il know but this is truly an american enterprise the soap box derby is something that i think all of us have known about for almost all of our lives it is an enterprise that takes the contributions of american business of american volunteers and certainly of the young people and their families this will be the 63rd running of the greater washington soap box derby and it will take place as my colleagues have heard on june 24 of this year this resolution authorizes the architect of the capitol as is necessary as i have said as well as the capitol police board and the greater washington soap box derby association to negotiate the necessary arrangements for carrying out the running that obviously will not be i think a difficult job although the concerns of the capitol police and the architect must be met and in fact are met in the past the full house hassupported this resolution

maryland the gentleman from virginia the gentleman from virginia the gentlewoman from the district of columbia the gentleman from virginia and others spoke supporting this resolution from 1992 to 1999

range from approximately 9 years of age to 16 years of age and come from communities in maryland the district of columbia and virginia the winners of this local event will represent the washington metropolitan area in the national race which will be held as it has been through history in akron ohio on july 22 of this year thederby provides our young people with an opportunity to gain valuable skills not only in those that i mentioned but in practical skills of engineering aerodynamics and other skills necessary to make that gocart go faster than any other gocart down that hill of course this is a beautiful hill capitol hill to use as they go down on the west side of our capitol furthermore the derby promotes teamwork a sense of accomplishment sportsmanship leadership and responsibilities these are attributes that we should encourage our young people to carry into adulthood that is why this enterprise like so many others is citically important i like so many in this chamber have the opportunity to be very much involved in the boys and girls clubs of america they have a national charter from this congress and they report to us annually like the boys and girls club
