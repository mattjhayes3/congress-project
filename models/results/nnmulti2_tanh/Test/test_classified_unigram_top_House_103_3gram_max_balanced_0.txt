actually would have accomplished i want to take this opportunity to make perfectly clear what i had proposed since my amendment was not made in order by this rule some may think that my explanation constitutes closing the gate after the horses are out of the corral the reason i take the time to do so however is both for final clarification here in the house and because i understand that the other body may have the opportunity to vote on an amendment such as i proposed i would like to help further that debate i fully support the intent of the presidents stimulus proposal that being to strengthen our economy however i do not believe that the 17plus billion of the stimulus spending should be added to the deficit i felt that we should pass a stimulus package that includes spending which truly invests in economic growth and we should pay for it by finding rescissions in consumption spending to offset that spending if there is one point i would hope to express as clearly as possible it is this my amendment would have allowed all spending included in the presidents supplemental to go forward without making any programmatic changes in his proposal i would not have deleted a single program or a single dollar from the presidents plan where i differed from the president is that i would require offsets in other appropriations for the approximately 10 billion in spending resulting from the bill in fiscal year 1994 and beyond the amendment would not have impeded the ability to spend money for economic stimulus it simply would have required that any stimulus coming from additional spending not add to the deficit after 1993 frankly my strong preference is that we pay for the entire supplemental but in the spirit of compromise i was willing to accept not paying for the spending in the current fiscal year if we agreed to pay for all of the spending in future years the purpose of this amendment was simply to require that the spending provided for by h r 1335 be within the spending ceilings set in the budget resolution that the house has just approved with my amendment the spending provided under this act would have been held harmless under the budget authority and outlay caps for fiscal year 1993 but any outlays resulting from the bill in fiscal year 1994 and beyond would have been subject to the current outlay caps for those years under h r 1335 nearly 60 percent of the emergency economic stimulus spending will be in fiscal year 1994 and beyond there will be nearly 600 million in emergency spending in 1997 one cannot argue reasonably for spending money on an emergency basis four years after the emergency declaration tonight we have passed a budget resolution which i supported that will move us in the right direction in dealing with our fiscal problems by providing for 510 billion in deficit reduction and a hard freeze in discretionary outlays over the next 5 years i worry about the message we are about to send to the public if we now pass a stimulus package that immediately exceeds the spending limits included in the budget resolution in an era when congressional credibility is anything but high we do ourselves yet greater damage and we also risk squandering the current public willingness to sacrifice personally for the sake of deficit reduction in a recent speech to the national league of cities president clinton argued that spending which invests in economic growth is more important than spending for consumption that is the spirit in which i had hoped to offer this amendment the amendment would have required that the spending in the supplemental intended to invest in economic growth be paid for by cutting spending that does not invest in economic growth if this body decides that the spending included in the sup plemental should be a priority then we should be willing to find offsetting spending cuts to pay for it we must set priorities in government spending the election last year made it obvious that the public is demanding greater fiscal responsibility from us the public recognizes that we cannot continue the practice of spending money on every good idea without considering how to pay for it that is

deficit could easily more than offset any benefit from spending intended for stimulus in testimony before the house budget committee just a few weeks ago alan greenspan could not have been clearer about the importance of immediate action on deficit redu ction when he stated reducing the structural deficit is crucial and action must be taken now postponing action would only extend the pattern of sluggish growth of the capital stock and with incomes and living standards lagging would ultimately make it even more difficult to engage in the programmatic actions thatare necessary he continued by saying i find misplaced the fear that deficit reduction would be overdone and create an undesirable degree of fiscal drag it seems to me highly unlikely that in the current political environment the congress and the administration would cut too much too soon from the deficit fiscal policymakers in turn by taking difficult but necessary measures to reduce the structural deficit now can enhance the growth of the economy and promote rising living standards for the american people for years to come like the president i care about economic stimulus i believe that it can be achieved only through the pairing of careful investment and deficit reduction based on the house being prevented from considering my amendment i regrettably must oppose the rule tonight"], [0.00045686960220336914,
