undertaking the compilation of a comprehensive and informative twovolume report entitled the chairmans report on children in america a strategy for the 100th congress volume i sets forth a strategy for this congress to consider as it acts upon legislative initiatives that will have a major impact on the lives of our children and their families volume ii in turn provides a wealth of information on a host of federally assisted programs which seek to provide necessary services for our children included are descriptions of programs which address the need for quality education opportunities for selfsufficiency the right to a safe and livable environment and services that will ensure healthy minds and bodies i shall focus my comments and observations on our network of child nutrition programsprograms which in my judgment play a key role in ensuring that our nations children first do have healthy minds and bodies and second are better able to obtain a quality education what is the current status of our child nutrition programs as the vice chairman of the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education which has jurisdiction over our child nutrition programs i believe that we have in place a strong national network of quality programs in which we can all take pride the past present and future success of our child nutrition programs is dependent on a strong federal state and local public and private sector partnership willing to invest the necessary resources to meet the nutritional needs of our nations youngsters when they are in awayfromhome settings at the heart of this network is the oldest and largest of our child nutrition programsthe national school lunch program today the national school lunch program provides nutritionally balanced meals to approximately 24 million school age children or 92 percent of all schoolchildren federal support is provided to participating school districts in a mix of cash and commodity support what level of support the federal government provides is in an inverse relationship to the economic status of the childs family the highest levels of federal support go to meeting the costs of providing meals to our neediest youngsters this is as it should be two important companion programs deserve mention the first is our school breakfast program which is designed to ensure that all youngsters begin their school day with the nutrients necessary to benefit fully from the days educational experience thanks to congressional action during the last congress i am pleased to note that modest increases in both cash and commodity assitance will now be available to improve the overall quality of the breakfast program meal patterns while our school lunch and breakfast programs play a vital part in meeting nutritional needs during the regular school year the summer feeding program complements that initiative by providing nutritious meals to our neediest youngsters during the summer months one of our fastest growing child nutrition activities is the child care food program which essentially provides meal services appropriate to youngsters enrolled in day care centers or family day care homes as more two wageearner families and growing numbers of single heads of households join our labor force the child care food progam will assume an everincreasing role in meeting the nutritional wellbeing of our younger children no overview of the status of our child nutrition programs would be complete without the mention of the special supplemental food program for women infants and childrenmore popularly referred to as the wic program wic is an early health intervention program that seeks to provide individually tailored food packages to lowincome pregnant women new mothers infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk medical services and nutrition education round out the wic program benefits wic program benefits cost an average of 30 per month in return studies clearly demonstrate that wic does make a difference in increasing the birth weights of infants of lowincome women who are at nutritional risk and the probability that these infantswill survive and enjoy a normal and healthy childhood what is the challenge facing the 100th congress in the area of child nutrition first we must see to it that the legislative changes enacted during the 99th congress are fully and quickly implemented second we must continue to take a long and hard look at all phases of child nutrition program policies and operations we cannot rest on our laurels so to speak rather we must strive to maximally utilize what will be of necessity limited resources to the end that we meet our commitment to providing for the nutritional wellbeing and improved educational opportunities afforded to all of our children what is at stake has been eloquently stated in the current offering of letters for women infants and children in the usa being conducted by bread for the world children are our future au of them while adequate diets wilu not compensate for the great differences in access to opportunity between those who have and those who do not it is a start food can enable some children to survive and many others to make better use of educational and economic opportunities food is preventative medicine providing protection from disease food assistance can limit the stress placed on parents without enough money to provide their children with the basic necessities of life it represents what is best in amerlca a dedication to our children

the capitol itself these improvements are long overdue and much needed the amendment i am offering today deals with the issue of a fire alarm system in every building on capitol hill the only reason i am offering this amendment which gets down to micromanaging what the architects office will do is because of what i read to be an apparent cavalier attitude in the architects office for fire and life safety as a result of a recent incident that occurred in the longworth building some quotations from representatives of the architects office have alarmed me one such quotation was that the congressional office buildings are as safe as any place in the world another one was that these buildings meet and exceed the building officials conference of america codethe boca codewhich describes the national standard 1 have talked to every major fire and life safety group in america since the fire in the speakers office i have also as recently as this morning talked to the executive counsel of the code and the organization that was cited by the architects office and in no way will they back up that statement in fact the longworth building is in blatant violation of that code today as a matter of fact the longworth building and other buildings on capitol hill are in violation of every major fire and life safety code in america contrary to what we have been told by the architect as a result of the fire in the longworth house office building in the speakers office we noted several discrepancies and deficiences first is a lack of a sprinkler protection system second was a lack of automatic recall of elevators third stairwells not being properly enclosed fourth a lack of preplanning and fifth a lack of any alarm system with which to evacuate the men and women who inhabit that building at that point in time this body as the result of a request that i made 2 weeks ago has approved a select committee to investigate that fire and make recommendations however as we investigate that fire and make recommendations there are some things that will be corrected by this particular bill the sprinkler systems are in fact being put into place today in the longworth building and there are plans for an alarm system to be installed in every building on capitol hill my concern is that these changes and improvements will take up to 2 years to complete that means that for 2 years we will not have any means of evacuating people in our office buildings during times of an emergency what happened 2 weeks ago when the speakers office caught on fire was the fact that we had members who left their offices on the fourth floor who were greeted with smoke and did not know whether to exit at the top of the building or down through the stairwells we had one staff person who apparently was on an upper floor of the longworth building who had a hearing problem and who never got the word to evacuate the building and in fact for 3 hours following the fire the d c fire department would not allow anyone in that building because of the level of toxic fumes and substances in the air it is intolerable that we in the capital of this great nation would allow our buildings to be so unsafe in

these tax provisions have worked reasonably well over the years however a changing marketplace and the emergence of new investment vehicles requires a future update of one of the tax rules governing

benefit to mutual fund investors this bill is revenue neutral moreover the treasury department last year stated its support for the proposed repeal of section 851 b 3 the tax treatment of mutual funds is based on the conduit theory generally the fund flows through to its shareholders the income and gain derived from the securities held in the funds portfolio the distributed income and gain is taxed at the shareholder level rather than at the fund level provided that the fund meets certain tests for qualification under subchapter m of the code failure to satisfy the stringent requirements of subchapter m will cause a mutual fund to be subject to the full corporate tax imposed under subchapter c of the code although the provisions of subchapter m have not required significant change since their adoption in 1936 a number of developments in recent years have made the socalled shortshort rule of code section 851 b 3 outmoded and unresponsive to the modern financial climate this bill would repeal section 851 b 3 the provision of the code which states that a mutual fund will not be eligible for conduit tax treatment if 30 percent or more of its gross income is derived from gain on the sale of stock or securities held for less than 3 months although the 1986 tax reform act included a provision which would permit the netting of offsetting gains and losses in certain designated hedge transations for purposes of computing gain under section 851 b 3 the relief provided by this amendment was indequate and unnecessarily burdensome to administer the provisions of section 851 b 3 continue to restrict a mutual fund managers ability to respond to modern financial conditions for example we have recently seen the introduction of such new investment products as exchangetraded stock options options and futures on debt instruments and options and futures on foreign currencies the creation of these new products has at least in part been a response to the volatility of interest rates currency exchange rates and the stock market these products which have become an integral part of all professional investment management are particularly useful in hedging against the risks of fluctuations in interest rates stock values and currency exchange rates mutual funds which are regulated by the securities and exchange commission should not be unduly restricted in the use of these modern ifivestment products by outmoded provisions of the internal revenue code even as recently revised code section 851 b 3 hinders the use of these products by mutual funds and thus hampers a mutual funds ability to protect its shareholders investments in a constantly changing financial environment section 851 b 3 was enacted at 4 time when products such as index options and futures financial futures and other new investment products did not exist and indeed were not even contemplated however in todays environment the rule thwarts a mutual fund managers fiduciary responsibility to act in the shareholders best interests first the rule prohibits a mutual fund from taking advantage of these new investment products even though they are used extensively by other investors second it imposes an unwarranted restriction on the funds ability to react and benefit from rapid changes in the market that is periods of volatile interest rates or when the value of securities increase abruptly thereby precipitating an artificial investment decision that may not be in the best interest of the mutual fund shareholder the following is an actual example of the adverse effects of this rule on mutual fund shareholders in 1981 a mutual fund took an extra long bond position because of the anticipated fall in interest rates interest rates did fall but more rapidly and more substantially than the fund anticipated in the face of a rapid interest rate reduction the fund would have benefited by closing out these positions within 2 months and by adopting a more defensive position however the fund was unable to close out the positions after only 2 months because it would have realized an impermissible gain under the 30percent rule for this and similar reasons and because it is in the best interest of the shareholders section 851 b 3 should be repealed as i mentioned previously the subchapter m provision of the code this bill would repeal was enacted with the revenue act of 1936 this provision was added along with the rest of subchapter m by the conference committee on the 1936 revenue measure this amendment to the 1936 laws was not the subject of public hearings prior to enactment or extensively discussed or even explained during floor debate on the measure in either body the legislative history of this law provides few clues to the derivation or purposes of the subchapter m provisions legal scholars and historians speculate that the subchapter m provisions were a reasonable response to the excesses of the unregulated marketplace of the 1920s and early 1930s that permitted investment companies to flaunt the public trust and secretly manipulate the prices fo individual stocks through excessive trading and selfdealing the excesses of the 1920s and early 1930s spurred congress to enact a number of reform measures between 1933 and 1940 over this brief 8year period congress worked continuously to reform the investment industry this reform movement produced the securities act of 1933 the securities exchange act of 1934 the investment company act of 1940 and the investment advisor act of 1940 the reform movement enacted a broad regulatory framework that carefully delineates monitors and controls every aspect of the activities of the mutual industry the regulatory framework is so thorough that by the mid1970s the chairman of the securities and exchange committee could tell the chairman of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs that no issuer of securities is subject to more detailed regulation than mutual funds the regulatory framework enacted by congress has proven to be sound public policy the mutual fund industry has grown and prospered the investing public has great confidence in the industry over 20 million americans now own shares in more than 2 000 mutual funds holding 800 billion in total assets the bill we are introducing today would not disturb this valuable regulatory framework it would be foolish to do so the purpose of this bill is to repeal an outmoded provision of tax law enacted in 1938 that no longer serves a purpose the treasury department expressed its support for the repeal of the shortshort rule last year in a letter to me dated february 5 1986 assistant secretary mentz stated that while section 851 b 3 does not serve a pressing tax policy goal it does impose substantial costs on rics and their shareholders both by requiring investment decisions to be made on noneconomic grounds and by forcing rics to monitor their compliance with the rule the subchapter m provisionthe socalled shortshort ruledoes not prohibit mutual funds form participating in futures and options trading it simply restricts earnings from such shortterm investments to 30 percent of total earnings the mutual funds have the authority to conduct futures and options trading hundreds of mutual funds do so in order to hedge against downside risk to quickly adjust equity exposure and to gain added return through arbitrage these"]]}
