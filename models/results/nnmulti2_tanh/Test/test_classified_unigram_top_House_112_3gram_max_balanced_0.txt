leader in the global economy they want us to invest in infrastructure build bridges highways clean energy and cut our dependence on foreign oil because when we make it in america thats when america will make it americans can make it cut yes what we ought to cut are the republican giveaways to the big oil companies to the wall street barons to the hedge fund managers who enjoy massive tax breaks thats where the cuts ought to be they ought to be cut out and what of this legislation thats before us we ought to vote no cut what doesnt create jobs for middle class families like republican giveaways to big oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to

medicare and medicaid and reduce social security benefits for those who need them the most the bill would also handicap the governments ability to respond to economic downturns and create jobs and it fails to address some of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of

complexity of a xanadu when we desperately need their high qualities of thought their patience of deliberation and their unerring sense of balance we have only what we have which is a political class that in the main has abandoned the essential qualities of statesmanship with the excuse that these are inappropriate to our age they are wrong not only do they fail to honor the principles of statesmanship they fail to recognize them having failed to learn them having failed to want to learn them in the main they are in it for themselves were they not they would have a higher rate of attrition falling with the colors of what they believe rather than always landing on their feetadroitly but in dishonor in light of their vows and responsibilities this constitutes not merely a failure but a betrayal and it is a betrayal of not only statesmanship and principle but of country and kin why is that it is because things matter even though it be played like a game by men who excel at making it a game our life in this country our history in this country the sacrifices that have been made for this country the lives that have been given to this country are not a game my life is not a game my childrens lives are not a game my parents lives were not a game your life is not a game yes its true we do have accumulated great stores of power of wealth and decency against which those who pretend to lead us can draw when as a result of their vanities and ineptitudes they waste and expend the gifts of previous generations the margin of error bequeathed to them allows them to present their failures as successes they say as we are still standing and a chicken is in the pot what does it matter if i break the links between action and consequence work and reward crime and punishment merit and advancement i myself cannot imagine a military threat and never could so what does it matter if i weld shut the silo hatches on our ballistic missile submarines what does it matter if i weld shut my eyes to the weapons of mass destruction in the hands of lunatics who are building longrange missiles our jurisprudence is the envy of the world so what does it matter if now and then i perjure myself a little what is an oath what is a pledge what is a sacred trust are not these things the province of the kinds of people who were foolish enough to do without all of their lives to wear ruts in the oregon trail to brave the seas to die on the beaches of normandy and iwo jima and on the battlefields of shiloh and antietam for me so that i can draw from americas great accounts and look good and be presidential and have fun in all kinds of ways that is what they say if not in words then indelibly in actions they who in robbing peter to pay paul present themselves as payers and forget that they are also robbers they who with studied compassion minister to some of us at the expense of others they who make goodness and charity a public profession depending on their election upon a wellmannered embrace of these things and the power to move them not from within themselves or by their own sacrifices but by compulsion from others they who knowing very little or next to nothing take pride in eagerly telling everyone else what to do they who believe absolutely in their recitation of pieties not because they believe in the pieties but because they believe in themselves nearly 400 years of americas hardearned accounts the principles we established the battles we fought the morals we upheld for century after century our very humility before god now flow promiscuously through our hands like blood onto sand squandered and laid waste by a generation that imagines history to have been but a prelude for what it would accomplish more than a pity more than a shame it is despicable and yet this parlous condition this agony of weak men this betrayal and this disgusting show are not the end of things principles are eternal they stem not from our resolution or lack of it but from elsewhere where in patient and infinite ranks they simply wait to be called they can be read in history they arise as if of their own accord when in the face of danger natural courage comes into play and honor and defiance are born things such as courage and honor are the mortal equivalent of certain laws written throughout the universe the rules of symmetry and proportion the laws of physics the perfection of mathematics human will that not only natural law but our own best aspirations have a life of their own they have lasted through far greater abuse than abuses them now they can be neglected but they cannot be lost they can be thrown down but they cannot be broken each of them is a different expression of a single quality from which each arises in its hour of need some come to the fore as others stay back and then with changing circumstance those that have gone unnoticed rise to the occasion rise to the occasion the principle suggests itself from a phrase and such principles suggest easily and flow generously you can grab them out of the air from phrases from memories from images a statesman must rise to the occasion democrats can do this harry truman had the discipline of plowing a straight row 10 12 and 14 hours a day of rising and retiring with the sun of struggling with temperamental machinery of suffering heat and cold and one injury after another after a short time on a farm presumptions about ruling others tend to vanish it is as if you are pulled to earth and held there the man who works the land is hard put to think that he would direct armies and nations truman understood the grave responsibility of being president of the united states and that it was a task too great for him or anyone else to accomplish without doing a great deal of injury if not to some then to others he understood that therefore he had to transcend himself there would be little enjoyment of the job because he had to be always aware of the enormous consequences of everything he did contrast this with the unspeakably vulgar pleasure in office of president clinton truman absolutely certain that the mantle he assumed was far greater than he could ever be was continually and deliberately aware of the weight of history the accomplishments of his predecessors and by hum ble and imaginative projection his own inadequacy the sobriety and care that derived from this allowed him a rare privilege for modern presidents to give to the presidency more than he took from it it is not possible to occupy the oval office without arrogantly looting its assets or nobly adding to them may god bless the president who adds to them and may god condemn the president who loots them america would not have come out of the civil war as it did had it not been led by lincoln and lee the battles raged for 5 years but for 100 years in the country both north and south modeled itself on their character they exemplified most perfectly churchills statement public men charged with the conduct of the war should live in a continual stress of soul the continual stress of soul is necessary as well in peacetime because for every good deed in public life there is a counterbalance benefits are given only after taxes are taken that is part of governance the statesman who represents the whole nation sees in the equilibrium for which he strives a continual tension between victory and defeat if he did not understand this he would have no stress of soul he would merely be happy about money showered upon the orphan taken from the widow about children sent to day care so that they may be long absent from their parents about merciful parole of criminals who kill again whereas a statesman knows continual stress of soul a politician is happy for he knows not what he does it is difficult for individuals or nations to recognize that war and peace alternate but they do no matter how long peace may last it will end in war though most people cannot believe at this moment that the united states of america will ever actually fight for its survival history guarantees that it will and when it does most people will not know what to do they will believe of war as they did of peace that it is everlasting the statesman who is different from everyone else will in the midst of common despair see the end of war just as during the peace he was alive to the inevitability of war and saw it coming in the far distance as if it were a gray wave moving quietly across a dark sea the politician will revel with his people and enjoy their enjoyments the statesman in continual stress of soul will think of destruction as others move in the light he will move in the darkness so that as others move in darkness he may move in the light this tenacity that is given to those of long and insistent vision is what saves nations a statesman must have a temperament that is suited for the medal of honor in a soul that is unafraid to die electorates rightly favor those who have endured combat not as a matter of reward for service as is commonly believed but because the willingness of the soldier to give his life is a strong sign of his correct priorities and that in the future he will truly understand that statesmen are not rulers but are servants it seems clear even in these years of squalid degradation that having risked death for the sake of honor is better than having risked dishonor for the sake of life no matter what youre told by the sophisticated classes that see virtue in every form of corruption and corruption in every form of virtue i think you know as i do that the american people hunger for acts of integrity and courage the american people hunger for a statesman magnetized by the truth unwilling to give up his good name uninterested in calculation only for the sake of victory unable to put his interests before those of the nation what this means in practical terms is no focus groups no polls no triangulation no evasion no broken promises and no lies these are the tools of the chameleon they are employed to cheat the american people of honest answers to direct questions if the average politician for fear that he may lose something is incapable of even a genuine yes or no how is he supposed to rise to the great occasions of state how is he supposed to face a destructive and implacable enemy how is he supposed to understand the rightful destiny of his country and lead it there at the coronation of an english monarch he is given a sword elizabeth ii took it last and as she held it before the altar she heard these words receive this kingly sword brought now from the altar of god and delivered to you by us the bishops and servants of god though unworthy with this sword do justice stop the growth of iniquity protect the holy church of god help and defend widows and orphans restore the things that are gone to decay maintain the things that are restored punish and reform what is amiss and confirm what is in good order that doing these things may be glorious in all virtue and so faithfully serve our lord would that we in america come once again to understand that statesmanship is not the appetite for power but because things mattera holy calling of selfabnegation and selfsacrifice we have made it something else nonetheless after and despite its betrayal statesmanship remains the manifestation in political terms of beauty and balance and truth it is the courage to tell the truth and thus discern what is ahead it is a mastery of symmetry of forces illuminated by the genius of speaking to the heart of things statesmanship is a quality that though it may be betrayed is always ready to be taken up again merely by honest subscription to its great themes have confidence that even in idleness its strengths are growing for it is a providential gift given to us in times of need evidently we do not need it now but as the world is forever interesting the time will surely come when we do and then so help me god i believe that solely by the grace of god the corrupt will be thrown down and the virtuous will rise up slavery was an abomination but statesmen arose and fought until its demise but 13 years after the foregoing words were first said we do so desperately need that statesmanship and gods unmitigated grace so that his providential gift of this nation to us may endure for additional generations and in the process may god resume blessing these united states of america i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.00018388032913208008, 0.4998161196708679, 1, "in

troops in afghanistan throughout the entire fiscal year 2013 however this is not the plan that our commander in chief has put forth nor is it the plan that many of us who would like to see the war come to a quick end would support as president obama has repeatedly stated we are winding down this war after withdrawing the surge troops by the end of this summer that will bring us to 68 000 troops at the beginning of the 2013 fiscal year we will continue to bring our troops home from afghanistan and i quote the president at a steady pace this amendment captures the billions of dollars that we will save by pursuing this steady drawdown of troops as opposed to maintaining troop levels at 68 000 throughout the entire fiscal year 2013 and then presumably on october 1 bring 28 000 troops home this amendment would cut 12 67 billion from the overseas contingency fund let me be clear about what this amendment does not do it does not cut funding for troops on the ground in afghanistan i believe as do all of my colleagues who have advocated for an accelerated end to this war that our troops in harms way should have all the resources they need to safely execute their mission and i am committed to ensuring that our troops on the ground have the best equipment and the compensation that they deserve this amendment does cut the oco funds that are unneeded and would not be used if we pursue the presidents steady drawdown plan in these fiscal times stringent as they are we should not be paying for things that were not going to buy and that we dont need and we certainly dont need to further pad the oco budget the committee has already approved an extra 3 25 billion cushion on the oco fund that was not even part of the presidents request we have already spent half a trillion dollars of taxpayer dollars on the war in afghanistan and the department of defense cant even account for many of those funds lost due to contractor fraud or afghan corruption when we take into account the longterm costs of this war such as servicing our debt and caring for the wounded warriors the costs are even more staggering many of us support a quicker timeline of withdrawing troops from afghanistan than the president has proposed after a decade of war we recognize that our core national security objectives have been met in afghanistan and that there is no unitedstates military solution to the remaining challenges in the afghanistan nation we began our military operations in afghanistan to eliminate those international terrorist organizations that threaten the united states thanks to the remarkable bravery and competency of our men and women in uniform al qaeda has been virtually eliminated from afghanistan terrorist training camps have been demolished and osama bin laden is dead thousands have given their lives to accomplish this and tens of thousands have suffered lifealtering wounds it is now time for our troops to come home it is also time for this house not to waste further money this amendment is not about ending the war it is about reducing the deficit by 12 67 billion we can do that by capturing the billions of dollars saved by the presidents proposed
