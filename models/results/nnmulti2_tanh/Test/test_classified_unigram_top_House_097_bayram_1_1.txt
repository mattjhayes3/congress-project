january 29 of this year as i have indicated earlier on the floor i sent the chairperson of the armed services committee a communication suggesting that we expand the parameters of the discussion in the debate in the armed services committee in light of the fact that this administration has proposed a military budget in excess of 1 6 trillion in the first 5 years of the decade of the 1980s and with the fact that millions of american people and millions of people around the world are raising significant questions with respect to our lockedstep effort toward thermal nuclear war i felt that we had a profound obligation to go beyond the parameters of the armed services connittee to hear from other witnesses who had a positive and constructive alternative to our present military policies in this country and around the world the chair sent back a polite letter indicating that for a number of bureaucratic reasons they had an obligation to go forward with the military budget i understood that and responded to the chair by indicating that it was my belief that it is a moral imperative that we establish a platform to provide an opportunity for brilliant minds to come together to pose an alternative to americas present military and nuclear policy therefore in april of this year we held 6 days of hearings to look at the full implications of the military budget we looked at the national security and foreign policy implications of the military budget the tactical and strategic implications of the military budget and arms escalation versus arms control we looked at the economic implications and the moral implications of the military budget we looked at the economic implications of americas global arms sales and finally we looked at citizen responsibility in ending the absurdity and the insanity of our nuclear arms race and our rapidly escalating military budget a number of brilliant witnesses came to washington from all around the country to testify at these hearings i would like briefly to give a few highlights that a number of the witnesses presented during those hearings in april the first witness was former senator j william fulbright of arkansas former chairperson of the senate foreign relations committee from 1959 to 1975 senator fulbright led off the hearings he stated as follows and i quote this budget together with the propaganda to sell it to the public and the congress has the effect of shifting the focus of our policy from that of deterrence of nuclear war to the waging and the winning of a nuclear war further quoting he said this military budget is so large and the emphasis upon nuclear weapons so strong and the rhetoric about the soviet threat is so extreme that one cannot resist the feeling that we are preparing to fight and win a nuclear war i believe if this is the case that it is a dangerous game and could easily get out of control and lead to a disaster it is not only dangerous it is costly and it threatens the stability and the soundness of our domestic economy mr paul warnke former director of the arms control and disarmament agency testified as follows there is no basis in fact for the assertion that the soviet union has strategic nuclear superiority we lead in strategic warheads again it really doesnt matter but we have a lead we also lead when it comes to survivable forces mr paul warnke former director of the arms control and dis irmament agency there is no credible scenario in which we and the soviet unioh could fviht a nuclear war and have either one of us be declared the winner either one of us might come out somewhat better than the other but we would be worse off than uganda or bangladesh we would no longer be recognized as superpowers in fact the question is would we be recognizable as a national entity ms randy forsberg president and executive director of the institute for defense and disarmanent studies pulling the nuclear tripwire ever tighter by improving first strike capabilities is extremely risky and dangerous if we continue to make nuclear escalation in a first strike format easier and more likely then in a crisis it will become inevitable clearly the stakes in the third world are not worth the risk to the whole of humanity what in the extraordinary is the hubris the arrogance the almost criminal carelessness of the men who pursue this policy in their confidence of the men who pursue this policy in their confidence that they can play nuclear chicken forever without ever losing control of the situation once dr paul p walker charter member of the boston study group and coauthor of the price of defense the defense department states boldly that this naval plan is based on the determi nation to restore and maintain maritime superiority over the soviets in order to wage severa wars worldwide against the soviet military empire such planning is based on several false assumptions one that we have somehow lost naval supremacy two that overwhelming maritime superiority enhances nationql se curity and three that aircraft carriers around which the current fleet is designed continue to be the most effective way to build and deploy

to feel a little better about their government and about the congress and i noticed that the polls recently reflect this there is a little bit of improvement in the feeling out among the people about this congress the members here have told me that they can sense that in their own districts i have wondered about the new attitudes we see these days and i have wondered what they might be caused by and i have become perplexed by it i have finally decided that it could be a mixture of things it probably is a mysterious mixture of the election in 1980 the space shuttle and the fact that our president has survived a mindless assassination attack and it might be that this congress is about to agree on a fundamentally different course of action for the country whatever the cause i think we need to nourish this new feeling this new attitude of hope and bring it along i think we need to do that because attitudes and expectations can have more to do with our economy in my judgment than the finetuning that we might do here any regulation that is done by the bureaucrats downtown or any monetary manipulation that might be done by the federal reserve now how can that be that attitudes and expectations can affect the way people behave well i know that the members hear the same things i hear out there among the people and that is why save your money why save it spend it on that television set or on that car because it is just going to cost you more next year ~ so we have a sort of inflationary mindset in this country and more than anything else i think we need to break that inflationary expectation i think we can do that if we act dramatically here we can alter the way people behave with respect to work savings investment productivity we need this new positive attitude for a second and perhaps an even more important reason and that is because while the presidents economic recovery sets a new course of action for the country it is a longterm commitment we did not get into these problems overnight and we are not going to get out of them overnight i hear people one after another say that we are just now finishing the easy part of this budget resolution we are just now finishing the easy part of our analysis of our economic condition the tough part is yet to come in order to maintain the resolve that we need as a people to see our way down this long road we need that positive upbeat spirit that national resolve that i think we can get if we act dramatically here the people are ready to do that i remember that when chairman volcker came before our budget committee he told the story of a ride hie had in a taxicab in new york city he and the driver got into a conversation about the economy and the chairman asked the driver how he thought the economy was going to be the driver said that he thought things were going to get worse the chairman was rather disappointed and he engaged him in further conversation in which the taxi driver said i think things are going to get worse first and then they are going to get better i rather think that it is like moving into a new house the house is going to be comfortable but when you first move in there are some inconveniences and there are some dislocations i think that is the situation we are in now with regard to our economy the point i think is that the commonsense of~ this country is not in this chamber and the commonsense of this country is not downtown the commonsense is out there in the country they know that we are changing direction and they know we have to keep that national resolve in order to get along with the economy so the people know the best chance we have to change the inflationary expectations in this country is to build the resolve that we need in the presidents program then after those two points about our attitude in this country i would like to make a third point and that is whether or not there is a difference between the jones resolution arnd the presidents proposal i happen to think there is a big difference the presidents proposal means less taxing the presidents proposal means less spending the presidents proposal means more growth the presidents proposal means less central government and the presidents proposal means more longterm commitment but the tactics of the time actually have been to suggest to the conservatives that there is not much difference and to the liberals it seems to me the suggestion is that there is a big difference with a little something for everyone i think that is the politics of confusion and i think if the people were present here in the chamber instead of the members commonsense world cut through that and they would support the president so i say those who would vote for the jones resolution on the basis that there is only a small difference between the two there is a big difference there is one indisputable big difference between the jones resolution and the presidents economic recovery program that has not been discussed and that is that only one of these pro gramsand that is the presidentshas the trust the confidence and the support of the people only one of these programs can alter expectations and break the inflationary mindset that is ruining our economy only one can change behavior of the people with respect to how they work produce and invest only one can be the best for the longterm support we have to have for this country so i say to this body that if we are going to be sending a signal here today why not give the presidents economic recovery program a chance"], [0.1290905773639679,

advocated such legislation and am pleased that the members of the house have agreed at long last to address these crucial issues in the area of personal income tax reduction however the conablehance bipartisan substitute is clearly preferable it provides for a 25percent reduction over 3 years while the ways and means committee has recommended only 15 percent over 2 years with the misleading promise of a third year based on an unachievable trigger further conablehance assures that beginning in 1985 individual income tax rates will be indexed to inflation this is the reasonthat the bipartisan substitute alone provides for real permanent tax reduction social security tax increases already mandated and bracket creep caused by inflation will result in a 22percent tax increase tor

increasingly distrustful of public officials at all levels of government it is vital that there be no taint of dishonor in the congress the most important legislative body in the land last years actions by the congress to increase substantially the compensation of its members were extremely disillusioning to millions of americans at a time when the president and the congress were asking tremendous sacrifices of most americansparticularly low and middleincome americanswe removed the limits on the tax deduction for expenses members incur by living in washington and we raised the outside earnings limitation which serves as a curb on the amount of money members may earn from special interests for making speeches writing articles et cetra in the senate that limit was eliminated entirely while in the house it was doubled to over 18 000 one of the worst aspects of this entire situation was that no separate rolleall vote was taken on any of these actions indeed with regard to the increase in the outside earnings limits in the house a rolleall vote taken only a few weeks before the increase was granted by a voice vote showed a solid majority of members opposing the increase only through subterfugeby bringing up the resolution without the knowledge or true consent of most memberswas this measure able to gain approval it has always been my belief that no salary increase enacted by the congress should take effect until the following congress is elected i feel this way for two reasons first there is an inherent conflict of interest in a specific congress voting itself a pay raise and second the voters should have an opportunity to endorse or reject an incumbent member or another cdndidate at the new actual salary members will earn throughout a new congress for this reason i have followed this policy myself since i entered the house in 1977 turning back pay increases until the voters of my district have had the chance to endorse or reject me at the higher pay level i am following that same policy with regard to the tax and outside earnings changes enacted last year and will not accept those increases until after the upcoming election i believe the entire congress can and should maintain this kind of policy i also believe that if the reasons for enacting a raise are legitimate members should not need to avoid going on record in support of such an increase finally i believe we cannot simply let last years actions standi believe the increase in the outside earnings limit should be postponed until the next congress in addition because it provides such a potentially huge windfall to members the elimination of the 3 000 limit on the tax deduction for members washington expenses should be rescinded entirely the ways and means committee should then reconsider the issue so that it can find a moderate level at which this limit can be setone that recognizes legitimate expenses but does not make members of congress a privileged class as the existing provision does therefore i have introduced several measures which i will now describe first a bill to prevent any salary increase from becoming effective until the seating of the congress following that in which the increase was approved the bill would also prevent a lameduck congress from enacting a pay increase for the following congress to prevent such an increase from becoming effective without any input from the voters second a resolution to prevent the house from voting members any salary increase any increase in outside earnings or any tax credit or deduction that applies to them as a distinct class without a separate rolleall vote on the issue third a bill to repeal the effect of the tax breaks congress voted itself last year fourth a resolution to delay until january 1 1983 the effective date of the increase in the outside earnings limitation for members of the house i am not someone who believes that there is no appropriate time for pay increases for members of congress this is a fulltime job and when it is done properly it is hard work but there are benefits and responsibilities that go along with this job that cannot be quantified but are more significant than any pay we might receive the benefit of having the ability to affect national policies to provide enormous help to people to contribute to the wellbeing of the nation and the world cannot be overestimated in addition the responsibility that comes along with that privilege and power means that we cannot abuse our mandatewe must remain accountable to our constituents therefore while we should not be afraid to raise our salaries when it is appropriate we should also remember that our jobs bring benefits no other american can share so those increases must be limited and we must remember to whom we are responsible and must be willing to tell our constituents that we feel a raise is merited and needed and that we are willing to go on record in support of such an increase only when the congress adopts a resonalie and honest policy with regard to pay increases will the american people truly be able to trust the motives and the instincts of the congress at this time in

mideast let us look at some of the questions before us some say we should not give the saudi the awacs unless there are americans to man them others question the alleged insecurity of the awacs technology in saudi hands i recall a story i heard the other day a highranking administration of ficial was being questioned by a distinguished member of the other body about the awacs deal the administration official said to the senator if the saudi dont buy awacs from us theyll simply turn around and buy a similar plane from the british and the senator replied let them buy it from the british if thats what they want and so the administration official said if you have no objection to the saudi pos jessing the technology as such why not let the united states make the sale instead of great britain and the senators reply to that was my time is up and i have no further questions ~ a vote against this sale is not going to deprive the saudi arabians of sophisticated flying radar technology is there anyone who doubts the capacity of the british nimrod to eventually perform awacs tasks does anyone doubt the saudis will buy the nimrod it is only a matter of money and the saudis have plenty of that if the saudis buy nimrods there will be no joint control of the plane so what are we gaining by forcing the saudis into a situation which deprives usof any chance of influencing the use of this technology is awacs a threat to israeli security of course not the israelis know perfectly well the saudis and other arab nations cannot mesh technologles in such a way that the saudi awacs could direct arab aircraft in a war against israel may i add one more point concerning the security question for over 30 years the united states of america has been sending our most sophisticated weapjons systems to the state of israel but since the creation of the state of israel there has not been a single day when anyone could guarantee the survival or security of israel they have always lived on the brink of destruction for over 30 years we have been told we must give israel every new weapon system it wants because it is in constant danger of disaster but suppose we had replied we cannot give israel high technology equipment because israels security is threatened we risk capture of our stateoftheart weapons technology israels security from invasion is too unstable to trust them with sophisticated weaponry which might fall into the wrong hands would not such an argument be missing the point in giving threatened israel sophisticated weaponry for over 30 years we have not taken counsel of our fears we have instead followed our commonsense that israels possession of high technology equipment is in our interests despite the risks it could possibly fall into enemy hands the same argument should hold true when it comes to saudi arabia the united states should not base its policy on fear but on selfinterest we are told that the fate of the shah of iran is a warning to us all do not sell sophisticated equipment to an autocratic ruler in the mideast because it will fall into the hands of our enemies the only thing wrong with such an argument is that it is based on a totally false analogy the iranians and the arabs are different people with different histories different customs different forms of government and different geopolitical roles the shah tried to force feed irans military modernization process thereby alienating many iranians the sadidis have used 72 to 90en of its military agreements with the united states to buy construction services infrastructures training and other elements the shah was opposed by irans religious leaders the saudi family faces no such opposition and is in fact closely tied to the religious leaders the shah changed leadership in his armed forces so often there was complete chaos the saudis have had great stability and continuity in its command structure and ministerial leadership since the 1060s so the analogies with iran are simply false we have an entirely different situation in saudi arabia what about the alleged threat to internal security from the millions of foreign workers who are in saudi arabia that threat cannot be dismissed lightly but it also cannot logically stand in the way of the sale if an internal threat to the saudi kingdom is so great that our awacs will be threatened the disaster will go beyond the mere capture or destruction of awacs it will engulf all of saudi arabia itself the loss of awacs will be the least of our worries besides if such a massive and imminent threat exists it wtll occur before we sell the awacs and if the danger is not immediate how can we predict what is going to happen in 1985 or 1090 the united states is irrevocably tied to saudi arabia for the foreseeable future economically and geopolitically our two nations hay mutual interests we may not like it some of our constituents may not like it mr begin certainly does not like it but like it or lump it the saudis need us and we need them i am not one of those who say we should be nice to the saudis because they allegedly hold down the price of oil we all know they charge exactly what is in their longrange interests no we should act only in our selfinterest and yes i am as irritated as anyone over the saudi reluctance to cooperate with american strategic initiatives in the mideast they have been uncooperative when it comes to the question of american forward bases and our role in regional security but it stands to reason that not selling them awacs will not make them any more cooperative it will only make matters worse what about the concerns of many americans over the effect this sale will have on the state of israel as one who believes that israel is vital to the national security interests of the united states i am convinced i 7ils figure comes from saudi arabia awacs and americas search for strategic stability in the near east a publication of the international security studio program of the wilson center smithsonian institute building washington d c by all the available evidence this sale will not endanger the security of israel nobody is asking israel and saudi arabia to like each other we are not running a computer dating service for mideast lonely hearts all wve are saying is that despite mutual dislike those nations have common enemies that can destroy either or both helping the saudis will not harm israelunless israel decides to perceive such help as harmful and we should not make policy based on the perceptions of other countries saudi arabia will not go away the geopolitical problems of the mideast will not vanish the hard strategic decisions will not suddenly be solved by denying awacs to the saudis our two nations are bound together like contestants in a thrceeegged race at a picnic we may be uncomfortable together we may stumble and find fault with each other but we have to learn to move together or else we both will lose summing up we find that every argument presented against this sale has no foundation in fact the awacs will not be a threat to israel but the nimrod might be a threat according to findings of the senate foreign relations committee joint control of the awacs does not guit the saudis but if they buy nimrod there wvill be no joint control and americans will have absolutely no voice in how the information is used we are told that awacs cannot help the saudis against soviet attack that is absolutely correct but it can help the saudis against air attacks from soviet client states you cannot logically argue that awacs is good enough to threaten israel and then argue it is not good enough to help defend the saudis from attack but that is exactly what opponents of this sale have argued voting against awacs will not stop the saudis from gaining awacstype technology all it will do is insure that we do not have a part in selling the technology training the crews and monitoring the information on a xetltime basis is this what those opposed to the sale want i do not think so but it is exactly what they are going to get let history judge which side of this debate best served the cause of freedom peace and security"], [0.8454488515853882, 0.8454488515853882, 0, "i move to strike the requisite number of words and i rise in support of the dunn amendment i stand

adding only 25 5 million back into aeronautics and maintains the presidents overall budget for nasa we can work out the details in conference the new administrations proposal is outlined as follows the administration has agreed to add 30 million to aeronautics in each fiscal year 1982 and fiscal year 1983 without changing the total from the presidents budget the reductions in fiscal year 1982 would be taken by relatively minor reductions less than 1 percent 20 million from space shuttle and operations 7 million from space science and applications and 3 million for tracking and data

from science andapplications 2 million from space research and technology and 5 million from tracking and data acquisition in light of the present status of the programs we believe these reductions

as one would expect with any comprehensive proposal there are provisions in this budget that i do not support but the thrust and direction of this budget are so important and so well researched that the few quarrels we have with it are insignificant and hardly affect my overall support for its aims i am concerned about some of its tax provisions particularly such proposals as the withholding of income tax on interest the repeal of the dividend exclusion and the limitations on some deductions like the mortgage interest deduction but my own research has uncovered numerous tax loopholes that the caucus budget has not included so i am confident that any lost revenue from tax changes that i could not support is easily recovered from repeal of any of a number of abusive tax loopholes while i express reservations about some of its tax proposals i must praise the general directions of the budgete tax section the caucus has proposed overhauling president reagans tax bill of 1981 a law so bad and so damaging to our economy that we would be better off repealing it and starting over the caucus also proposes repealing the special tax subsidies we give oil companies charity for our wealthiest corporations that is unconscionable in general the caucus philosophy of eliminiating the costly and hidden subsidies that have benefited the special interests for years is admirable also i want to point out that this budget does not just help poor peopleit addresses the problems that all people in america are experiencing it properly closes the gaping holes in reagans socalled safety net and restores the ability of senior citizens to retire with dignity and our handicapped and children to become productive but it goes far beyond that to address the problems of our entire society in

apply those revenue estimates to budget proposals which are going to end up with a 100 billion deficit but i do not think that there is any justification for trying to impose those false assumptions on the one budget the balanced budget which we are offering which will reduce the deficit to zero which therefore will in a dramatic way bring interest rates down and investment up and therefore you see will increase revenues even more than we are projecting so we do make this correction in our balanced budget substitute furthermore because of the added economic stimulus that will result from lower interest rates produced by a balanced budget we are saying the achievement of our revenue baseline estimates becomes all the more probable working from these revenue and outlay baselines we achieve a balance budget by several measures first of all even though we wish it were not necessary we freeze all pay and benefits paid by the federal government at their october 1 1982 levels that means all pay and benefits it means social security beneificiaries will get their 1982 2ncrease as scheduled on july of tils year of 7 4 percent and that other costofliving increase coming hi by october 1982 will stick but during fiscal 1983 beginning on the first of october evenly and evenhandedly there will be no raises and no costofliving increases because that is necessary though we wish it were not if we are going to halt budget deficits and the damage that they are doing to our economy second even though we wish it were not necessary national defense will be cut in our proposal by 8 billion under the presidents request our defense outlays are within a billion dollars of that prepared by the house budget committee in its resolution and 2 billion below the latta substitute third even though we wish it were not necessary we do make significant cuts in most budget categories as follows international affairs 4 6 billion under the jones bill for a total of 7 5 billion science space and technology 750 million under the jones bill en ergy 1 7 billion under jones leaving 3 3 billion natural resources and environment 1 85 billion under the jones proposal leaving 9 billion agriculture 500 million under jones for a total of 9 6 billion commerce and housing credit 950 million under jones leaving 2 billion transportation 3 billion under jones for 17 billion community and regional development 1 4 billion under the jones proposal leaving 6 5 billion education training employment and social services 3 45 billion under jones for a total of 24 billion health 6 1 billion under jones leaving 74 billion income security 24 05 billion under jones leaving all of 249 billion without significant losses to social security beneficiaries veterans benefits and services no change from the jones proposal the administration of justice 550 million under jones leaving 4 1 billion general government 850 million under jones leaving 4 billion general purpose fiscal assistance 4 7 billion under jones leaving 1 8 billion assuming suspension of general revenue sharing until we have revenues to share interest 23 billion under jones for a balance of 92 billion achieved by not having to borrow more money and by the drop in interest rates that would follow a balanced budget and allowances and undistributed offsetting receipts recommended at the same levels as in the jones proposal lastly even though we wish it were not necessary we raise 18 billion in additional revenueswhich is less than any other proposal contemplates even though we wish it were not necessary to raise any more taxes at all as with other proposals we do not specify the precise sources of that revenue but we state that the undeniable result of a balanced federal budget is more important than taking a hard line on preserving tax loopholes let me say that again we state that the undeniably favorable result of a balanced federal budget is more important than taking a hard line on preserving all of the existing tax loopholes the committee on ways and means on which the gentleman from california and i serve will examine all of these options for me personally the suspension of general

serve the good of the nation although i prefer revenue sharing to the alternative of categorical grants i am not willing to let revenue sharing stand between a 100 billion deficit and a balanced budget once you exempt one favored program other exemptions will follow like dominoes and the deficits will continue to soar by protecting and saving each and every ox from being gored we continue to pile up the debt required to do that and then we continue to suffer these abnormally high interest rates we have crossed the trillion dollar threshold on the public debt during this past year there is no way we can have any ungored oxen they will be gored by high interest rates if we continue these deficit policies now all the other budget substitutes that are being proposed begin with the assumption that the best that can be done is to cut those current law deficits in half from 182 billion down to the 100 billion level give or take 10 billion all of them begin with that assumption every one of the other substitutes i say to my colleagues that we cannot afford to simmer along with these halfway measures which will produce only halfway results as a member of the budget committee i saw during the work of that committee that if we begin with the acceptance that all we can do is cut the current law deficit of 182 billion roughly in half then we are going to take halfway measures to get there halfway measures will produce halfway results interests rates will not come down as substantially we would get a halfway improvement in interest rates we would get a halfway improvement in investment and we would get a halfway improvement in jobs a halfway improvement in unemployment if all we do is generate a halfway recovery a halfway reduction of deficits will only reduce interest rates halfway that will lead to halfway investment activity we believe that the present economic hardships faced by our country and by our people deserve not halfway solutions but a total commitment

speaking of ken holland and john napier it is with deep regret that i see these two outstanding members of the house of representatives returning to south carolina ken holland has been a tireless leader in his important role as the chairman of the congressional textile caucus it has been my privilege to serve with him as the vice chairman ken has always played it down the middle and has been a voice of moderation he has been most effective and productive in his legislative activities and his office has provided good constituent service for the people back home john napier is one of the brightest and most articulate freshman congressmen i have known and i regret very much that he was not reelected he was running in a very tough district with an overwhelming registratin against him however he ran a strong race lousic and i will miss john and pam they are fine people and we need more of their type in the nations capital john has been an excellent representative honest fair

ducks of world war ii and we all now know of course about the lame ducks as they pertain to sessions of congress after election certainly the millions of enlisted men who received the rupturedduck emblem upon discharge from the armed services in world war ii were anything but ruptured or in any way disabled and it certainly is not necessary or even fitting that this lameduck session of congress

unfortunately we do not have the convenience right now of being able to change the budget process we are in the middle of dealing with the budget resolution that is before the house whether we like it or not the budget resolution that we are working on has taken on proportions that probably are beyond the original intent of the budget resolution which was to establish general targets but whether you like it or not the reality is that today a budget resolution adopted by the congress is being looked at by the investment markets it is being looked at by the federal reserve it is being looked at by the people of the united states to determine whether we have the discipline to try to deal with the problems in our economy it has an impact that goes out far beyondwhat this institution i think originally intended in the budget resolution but for that reason it is most important that we roll up our sleeves and continue to work at the budget resolution that is before the house i know there is a great deal of frustration about some of the amendments that have been adopted but the reality is that not all is lost we are going to proceed it seems to me to be able to vote on these amendments and these substitutes as revised we have the opportunity in conference to work out an agreement that will be somewhere in the middle that is the essence of our democratic process so i hope that members do not lose all hope just because a few amendments have or have not been adopted in the democratic process that is after all what this house is all aboutmembers having the opportunity to offer amendments and members having the opportunity to vote on those amendments as they wish so we have gone through that process and it has been good and it hav been healthy but the ultimate thing is for us not to be so discouraged that we decide we are going to do away with the entire process or we are going to do away with all of the resolutions we have to come together on one of these substitutes and i hope that we can pull together behind one of these substitutes to insure that the house is able to get something adopted ultimately our responsibility is to the american people and to the preservation of our economy"], [0.0024340450763702393, 0.49756595492362976, 1, "i reclaim my time in looking at this bill this is not a bill of protectionism for small business this is a bill that looks at our federal government looks at the taxpayers dollars and except for the department of defense which is exemplary and the gentleman is correctexcept for that and a few other agencies small business is shutout shutout in a variety of ways the fact is that small business through its efforts in the last decade has presented the american people more opportunities for innovation and job creation than any other part of our business community and all we are doing in this bill acrosstheboard in a fair manner is to provide small business a toehold not for protectionism but for true competition the benefits of which accrue to the american people now as to the department of defense nothing in this bill requires the department of defense to do more than it does today but this bill will prevent the department of defense from sliding backward from sliding backward to its commitment to work with small business now maybe that will work a bureaucratic hardship in the department
