leadership decided to resume its efforts to push for big tax cuts for the rich they attached hundreds of billions of dollars of these tax cuts to the minimum wage bill and the budget resolution this decision to squander the surplus rather than invest it severely reduced the funds available to meet many of our nations critical needs overall the bill provides 2 9 billion less than the president

opportunity to address this house i rise in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also

children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the

industrial as well as farm communities and even though this district that i represent is so very very diverse i find there is a common message and that is the folks back home want us to come here republicans and democrats and work together to find solutions to the challenges that we face that is why i am so proud that over the last 5 years we have done so many things we were told we could not do we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years we gave a middleclass tax cut for the first time in 16 years we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation and a great accomplishment just this past year was we stopped the raid on social security for the first time in 30 years that is progress on our agenda and we are continuing to move forward to find better ways to help find solutions our agenda is pretty simple paying down the public national debt saving social security and medicare helping our local schools and we also want to bring fairness to the tax code that is one of the issues i want to talk about today because i believe that as we work to bring fairness to the tax code particularly to middleclass working families that we should focus first on the most unfair consequence of our current complicated tax code and that is the marriage tax penalty which is suffered by almost 21 million married working couples let me explain what the marriage tax penalty is under our current tax code if they are married both husband and wife are working they pay more in taxes than they do if they stay single let me give this example a marriage tax penalty example a machinist and a schoolteacher middleclass working folks in joliet illinois with a combined income of 63 000 paymore and here is how they do it if they have a machinist making 31 500 he is in the 15 percent tax bracket if he marries a schoolteacher with an identical income of 31 500 under our tax code they file jointly their combined income of 63 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and for this machinist and schoolteacher they pay the average marriage tax penalty of almost 1 400 more just because they are married under our tax code now if they chose to live together instead of getting married they would have saved that 1 400 our tax code punishes them if they choose to get married that is just wrong it is a pretty fair question is it right is it fair that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher in joliet illinois pay more in higher taxes let me give my colleagues another example here of two schoolteachers also of joliet illinois michelle and shad hallihan they were just married in the last couple of years a wonderful young couple i have had a chance to sit down and talk with them and of course i have a nice wedding photo the point is that shad has taught a little longer than michelle and he makes 38 000 a year his wife michelle makes 23 500 because they chose to get married to live together in holy matrimony they suffer the marriage tax penalty because their combined income when they file jointly pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket for them for michelle and shad hallihan in joliet illinois two schoolteachers they pay almost a thousand dollars more michelle has pointed out to me since they have just had a baby that is almost 3 000 diapers that 1 000 of marriage tax penalty would pay for in that family if they were allowed to keep it now the republicans in this congress believe that eliminating the marriage tax penalty should be a priority and we believe that in this era of budget surpluses when the federal government is taking in more than we have been spending that we should give some of it back we want to focus that on bringing fairness to the tax code this past year we sent to the president legislation that would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for people like michelle and shad hallihan unfortunately the president and vice president gore chose to veto that legislation because they wanted to spend the money on new government programs my colleagues should it not be a priority to help people like michelle and shad hallihan married working couples who work hard and who are unfairly treated by our

these harried commuters are hardworking mothers and fathers who should have these hours to spend with their families transit riders throughout the mta system will benefit from better distribution of passengers made possible by the esa project planned new entranceways into the grand central station complex will enhance the stations flow of lirr metro north and subway transit passengers in queens passengers also will benefit from a new station to be built in sunnyside this project which will provide major transportation benefits for the entire new york city metropolitan region has received federal transit new start funding for the last three fiscal years in addition a major portion of its overall length was constructed throughout the 1980s with neary 900 million in federal dollars plus an equal amount of state local dollars as part of the mtas 63d street tunnel and connector project the esa project will complete the unfinished elements of these federally aided projects by allowing lirr commuter trains to use the already constructed lower level of the tunnel and proceed into grand central station the busy upper level of the 63d street tunnel now carries subway trains in addition to maximizing passenger circulation throughout the transit system esa will enhance the environment by taking over 12 000 cars per day off the east river bridges that bring commuters from queens brooklyn nassau and suffolk to jobs in the nations largest central business district it will also allow for reverse commuters to leave the west side of manhattan from the same location that metro north railroad customers now enjoy the esa project which i anticipate will be completed by 2011 is moving ahead steadily the project is prepared for actual construction to begin during this calendar year and to go into high gear in early fiscal year 2001 local and state support for esa are strong it is govemor patakis no 1 transit priority the mayor and the county executives of nassau and suffolk as well as the business community support the project nearly 192 million in state and federal funds already have been invested in the esa project including 46 million in federal new starts appropriations with the mtas suggested overmatch of 50 percent similar to what it had provided for its previous new start project the 63d street connector the esa is a solid federal investment that will maximize the use of facilities already built with federal dollars and awaiting use by the taxpayers a number of my colleagues including congresswoman carolyn mccarthy congressman gregory meeks congressman joseph crowley have worked together to support including fiscal year 2001 funds for the esa project in the appropriations committees reportedbill it has been a tough effort because there

native americans have been hearing these promises for over 200 years from this congress bia and interior and it does not materialize i still remember in my lifetime where the city fathers of the local

our time the impact diabetes has on the health of our population on the national budget is staggering every year diabetes causes about 24 000 more people to lose their sight 28 000 more people to undergo dialysis or transplantation for kidney failure and 77 000 more people to lose their lives from heart disease these diabetesrelated side effects in combination shorten life expectancy by an estimated 15 years in the year 1999 approximately 800 000 people will be diagnosed with diabetes and the disease will contribute to almost 200 000 deaths in the united states the number of americans with diabetes has increased nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years again a primary reason that the cdc has called it the epidemic of our time the public and private costs of diabetes are enormous an estimated 105 billion annually including over 40 billion a year in federal dollars more then 1 out of every 10 health care dollars in the unitedstates and about 1 out of 4 medicare dollars is spent on diabetes care in new york state almost 600 000 people and 10 of our seniors have been diagnosed with diabetes at an annual public and private cost of about 8 billion diabetes kills one american every 3 minutes and a new case of diabetes is diagnosed in the united states every 40 seconds and unfortunately an estimated 52 million americans have diabetes right now and do not even know it but new research is filled with promise the diabetes research working group created by congress in 1997 has developed a comprehensive plan for future research that would cost 827 million next year congress mandated this study congress has received its mandated report and yet last year we gave 448 million about half of what is called for only 3 percent of the total nih budget for diabetes that is simply 28 per patient that is not enough yet every day research and new technologies are improving diabetes diagnosis and treatment for example current diagnostic methods cannot always detect adult onset diabetes at the earliest stage of the disease but a new technology has been developed that will diagnose adult onset diabetes as much as 5 years earlier than any current method by scanning the eye retina with low intensity florescent light an early diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications we need to increase research for diagnosis blood testing is also becoming less obtrusive a continuous glucose monitoring system recently approved by the fda continuously and automatically monitors glucose levels underneath the skin future generations of this device may permit the patient to monitor blood levels and connect to an insulin pump for seamless care a glucowatch a device worn like a wristwatch will test blood levels easily and painlessly this device which is pending fda approval is as successful at blood testing as conventional methods that require pricking the finger multiple times every day and causes only a slight tingling sensation we need to increase research for blood monitoring we also must increase research for treatment for example we are at the brink of developing an ability to inhale insulin rather than inject it into the body multiple times per day another burden for people with diabetes is the need to inject themselves with insulin several new drugs taken orally may reduce the need to take insulin injections one class of drugs called insulin sensitizers helps to lower blood glucose primarily by reducing insulin resistance in muscles other groups of drugs work by suppressing glucose production from the liver increasing insulin production by the pancreas or decreasing sugar absorption from the intestine for those who will still need insulin a power is being developed that can be inhaled so that injections might not be necessary we need to increase research for treatment in juvenile diabetes type 1 insulinroducing cells called islets are destroyed making daily insulin injections necessary the juvenile diabetes foundation jdf has established three centers for islet transportation which will attempt to transplant healthy islets to cure juvenile diabetes and find new ways to prevent transplant rejection and other dangerous sideeffects the nih and the jdf are also developing new ways to manipulate the immune system by inhibiting harmful immune responses while keeping protective ones intact we need to increase research for cures ultimately genetics may hold the key to a cure the american diabetes association has initiated the genetics of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus gennid study in order to maximize the rapid identification of the gene or genes involved in adultonset diabetes this study has established a national database and cellbank to store information and specimens from families with long histories of the disease the human genome project which is currently mapping the entire human genetic structure may also provide significant clues to the nature of diabetes again we need to increase research for treatment but the fight goes on we must increase support and research for diabetes for diagnosis for monitoring for treatment and ultimately for a cure"], [0.9981967210769653,

bill the caribbean amnesty and relief act and i would like to speak about it dgain i am very proud to introduce the caribbean amnesty and relief act which is legislation to reduce the devastating impact on the caribbean community caused by the 1996 immigration reform bill the people of the caribbean basin have always been loyal friends of the united states at the height of the cold war the united states looked to the caribbean nations to fight the infiltration of cubanstyle communism as a result the caribbean countries suffered political upheaval and the people of the caribbean fled to the united states to escape human rights abuses and economic hardship people of the caribbean have now established roots in the united states many in my congressional district many have married here and many have children that were born in the united states the economic structure of the caribbean is such that it cannot absorb the great number of undocumented people now present in the united states our country in my opinion should grant the caribbean population already in the united states amnesty since they have been here so long and continue to benefit the united states economy the jamaicans for example present in the united states send back to their families 800 million in unitedstates dollars per year the jamaican economy would be severely strained if that money were to disappear in 1997 congress recognized that the illegal immigration reform and responsibility act would result in grave injustices to certain communities and so we passed the nicaraguan and central american relief act but left out caribbeans i believe that that was very unfair we need to pass legislation which will help the caribbean community thus i am proud to take the lead on the caribbean amnestyand relief act i would like to again tell my colleagues what this would do this bill would allow for an adjustment for permanent residents for caribbean nationals who have lived and worked in the united states prior to september 30 1996 and have applied for an adjustment of status before april 1 2002 this means that caribbeans who have been in the unitedstates prior to september 30 1996 without proper documentation can receive green cards the bill provides for spouses and children of those who have become permanent residents under section a to also become permanent residents of the unitedstates if they apply before april 1 2002 the bill establishes a visa fairness commission which will study economic and racial profiling by american consulates abroad and customs and immigration inspectors at unitedstates points of entry the purpose of this section is to determine whether there is discrimination against caribbeans and others when applying for a visa or upon enteringthe united states in addition this section would allow for the secretary of state to waive the visa fee for those who are too poor to pay again it is imperative that we try to unite families it is unconscionable that we would have families here in the united states and others in the caribbean nations who want to be reunited but through loopholes cannot be we are also concerned about the arbitrariness of people who are granted green cards and some people who are not able to get green cards we think that much of this is done in an arbitrary manner this is important legislation and i urge the house to give it favorable consideration as soon as possible we are after all dealing with peoples lives i look upon immigration as a good thing for this country immigrants built this country the reason why this country has done so well through the years is because the best and the brightest from all over the world have come to these shores as my four grandparents did many many years ago and have helped to build this country what kind of a person emigrates to these shores it is not a lazy person it is someone who is willing to put aside all of the customs and cultures leaving family behind and coming to this country is certainly an industrious hardworking person who just wants to be given a chance that is what the united states has meant to millions and millions and millions of people through the

the money to train teachers that are already teaching and are not certified that is the problem in america but the political promise that we were going to hire 100 000 teachers which sounds good is

act was to deregulate the telecommunications industry at that time it was heralded as a great event we had not deregulated the telecommunications industry since 1934 so when we finally deregulated all of us thought that this would possibly reduce government because of deregulation instead of reducing government the fcc which monitors and overlooks the telecommunications revolution expanded quite dramatically and they obviously will claim they need additional staff but i contend that with all these mergers and all of this everchanging landscape we have to ask do they need 2 000 fulltime equivalent employees at the fcc i believe that in some places they have the necessary employees but one area i am particularly concerned about is in the media relations department do they need almost 20 people to do media relations to make press clips to send out press releases and to sell the fcc this is a government agency this is not the washington post this is not the lockheedmartin corporation it is just an independent government agency yet they have almost 20 people to do media relations what is the need for an agency to be able to carry out a media campaign of public relations this is in addition to the press operations the fcc bureau office employs already that is right the seven bureau offices have their own press contacts and the five commissioners all have their own press contacts so let us take a look at this chart when we look at this chart and see all the difference departments in the fcc that make up this 2 000 employees agency and we relate that each of the commissioners have their own press contacts and each of the bureaus have their own persdn to deal with media we have a right to ask and then we come over to this box the office of media relations which is over there and we say to ourselves what do they do and how big are they they are responsible for informing the press and the public about the fccs actions facilitating public participation issuing news releases public notices and other information material that sounds pretty good there are 17 people in that office now i would like if i could to take this chart down and show what makes up that media relations department first of all the american taxpayer is paying four people an average salary of 77 349 another four people at 98 743 and one person is making almost 131 000 a year so if you look back up here and see 17 of these different persons that make up this media relations we will understand that the composite group of these 17 people are making a great deal of money in fact

their present job frantically working until midnight like tonight my amendment prohibits the fcc from appropriating more than 640 000 instead of 1 100 000 for the office of media relations i need to remind the chairman of the fcc that employees of the commission are public servants this office andothers throughout the fcc are unelected and now are getting paid almost as much as federal judges in

worthy amendment i also call upon the president to reconsider his position on this issue for the longterm good of the entire country"], [0.00864061713218689, 0.4913593828678131, 0, "i rise in opposition to the antimexico city policy amendment and in support of the rights of united states citizens to refuse to subsidize the taking of lives of millions of unborn children throughout the world this amendment has nothing to do with the intended purposes of the international family planning it has everything to do with promoting united states taxpayerfunded abortions last november president clinton accepted a compromised version of the reaganbush mexico city policy which followed the precedent that taxpayers funds should not be used to pay for abortion services the compromise capped population assistance at 385 million and allowed 15 million to be used for abortion services or given to agencies that conducted abortion services this years foreign operations appropriations bill contains the same language that was agreed to last year more importantly it reinforces our overseas population assistance efforts to the original intent to teach individuals the concept of responsible family planning so we could reduce the number of abortions by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies this compromise is not perfect it does not honor our longstanding tradition of not forcing united states taxpayers to subsidize abortion services for others when they have a moral or religious objection to it it did however move us back in that direction now some members want to undo the compromise that took 7 years of an administration to achieve some of us would like to see all funding for foreign abortion services zeroed out i am strongly prolife and believe that every life deserves protection i do not believe the taxpayers should ever be forced to pay for abortion services but i am now here today to offer such an amendment because we believe we should honor the spirit of the compromise we reached last year not only would this amendment strike the compromise of population assistance but it would strike the transfer of 12 5 million to further child survivor programs should the administration choose to fund abortion services i urge a no vote on this amendment"], [0.010174393653869629, 0.5101743936538696, 1, "i thank my colleague the gentleman from california for yielding me the time while i support this bill i do have some concerns about it and at the appropriate time i will offer an amendment that i think can set the stage for addressing those concerns as the gentleman from alaska and others have noted this bill was prompted by information developed by the committee on resources through the oversight process as a result of that oversight it became clear that it would be desirable to revisit the underlying statutes at issue here although i think it is also clear as my colleague from california suggests that some of the charges about the actions of the current administration have been exaggerated and that those folks making those charges have failed to point out similar actions that occurred during prior administrations the programs of assistance to state and wildlife agencies addressed by this bill are very valuable for my home state of colorado and of course for all the other states that make up our union this bill deals with a very important subject that deserves careful scrutiny by the committee on resources and by the whole house itself i do think that congress does need to reconsider the degree of discretion that burrent law allows the interior department with regard to the administration of these programs however in responding to the ways the interior department has used its discretion in the past i fear that the bill may go too far in the other direction i certainly understand the purpose of limiting the amount of money that can be spent on administration because obviously what is spent that way will not be available for the substantive purposes of the programs but at the same time we need to recognize the administration is necessary and adequate administration is essential to avoid the risk of misuse of taxpayer funds either by the department of interior or by other parties that is why i am concerned when the interior department says that limits set by the bill would likely require reduction in the number of people who would administer these programs because adequate staffing is necessary to administer any program i am also concerned that the bills provisions are too inflexible and too detailed and that even more specific requirements are suggested in parts of the committees report on the bill accountability is essential but excessive paperwork for its own sake can eat up resources that could be put to more productive uses and i do not think we should make it impossible for the interior department to respond to new developments such as the very significant and very desirable increase in the scope of these programs that would come from the enactment of h r 701 the cara legislation which the committee on resources has already approved and which i hope will come to the floor of the full house in the near future as i said i support the bill i will do so not because i think it is perfect but because i think it is desirable to make some progress on this subject it is my hope that we can further refine the bill as we proceed through the legislative process with the other body and if necessary in conference however should that not occur our committee and the house may be better advised to return to this subject next year"], [0.012663543224334717, 0.4873364567756653, 1, "i thank the ranking member the gentleman from michigan for yielding me this time i know some people think that debate is not often instructivebut i just learned from the gentleman from virginia that the companies that will be the beneficiaries of this bill support it that is something people might not have taken for granted beyond that however i want to pay tribute to tlie great work of the gentleman from virginia the gentlewoman from california and the chairman or the ranking member but chairman to be the gentleman from virginia and the gentlewoman from california have in particular distinguished themselves by thoughtful advocacy of the legitimate concerns of the high technology community they have the vehicle that is the only one that can become law the administration has changed its position it has been in part because of the work of these individuals who have said to them that they are wrong to just stonewall let us work out a reasonable position now there is one other thing i do want to notice i know there are members who talk about how government always gets it wrong and the private sector always gets it right one of our leaders of the house sa ys government is dumb and the markets are smart i think the markets obviously are wonderful in their work but i do have to note that in this case it was not the government that forgot that 1999 would become 2000 that was the private sector we all make mistakes the private sector is now coming to that stupid government and saying can we get a little help i think we should i think that is an appropriate role for government but we ought to understand what has happened here what this amendment does is to deal sensibly and try to find a compromise i do not agree with everything i am against unlimited punitive damages i voted against the amendment of my friend the gentleman from virginia"]]}
