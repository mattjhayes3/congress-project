new embassy on mount alto the will of the congress is now perfectly clear as the price for penetrating our new embassy in moscow the soviets must no longer be allowed to enjoy the intelligence advantages of mount alto mount alto is the second highest point in washington from that position the soviets can intercept 70 percent of the private telephone calls in the entire region and they can train their listening devices on every important government facility in town the congress rightly asks why should the kgb continue to reap the intelligence bonanza of mount alto while the american taxpayers spend 90 million to clean up the mess they made of our embassy in moscow the answer is that they shouldnt and both houses of congress have now voted by overwhelming margins to reclaim mount

scrubbed 18yearold girl next door presented naked in his centerfolds and up to some very graphic pictures as of the last 4 or 5 years what it has been replaced by is a videocassette section of hardcore pornography in most in my experience of the video rental places when some family sees a pussycat disgusting hardcore theater roll up its carpet and close the doors they think well have we awakened in america no it is only because they have lost box office and this is all available in the local rental place i stopped frequenting one in my neighborhood because i saw a parentguardian renting hardcore homosexual videotapes and you could tell because they have a large jacket and graphic pictures on the cover and he was renting it and lie had in tow a 10yearold boy and a 13yearold girl and after we left the store i was angry at myself that i did not go tip and inquire are you their parent is this the standard you raise them by but like most americans i kind of shrank back and said oh let him wreck his life but he is wrecking those kids lives we are more graphic in lustful sex exploitation material in 1988 than we were last year or the year before twenty years or so of the sexual revolution has not run its course and one of the ironies i would like to point out to my good friends is that they even tried to use the war in vietnam to push this sexual permissiveness the main battle cry of the war and you can ask any page who was an infant or not even born then what is the most memorable expression that comes out the war and i will help them a little bit and say was it ho ho ho chi minh or hey lbj how many kids have you killed today and they will eventually say i know what it was make love not war of course whether it was woodstock where the young girls were running around naked and young guys that was not just making love we are talking about lust just happenstance encounters like dogs in an alley that make lust just having sex for the celebration of recreational sex in and of itself and then they try to play off against it instead of going off to war as if our young soldiers were over there enjoying the battle that was going on and the irony is as i pointed out earlier we are now seeing more people die at least in the homosexual community because of casual multiple contacts from the public latrines down to the massage parlors and the hot tubs and the clubs that the people hang out in all of these deviant lifestyles and more people are going to die because of lust in the 1980s than died during the decade of the vietnam war by far it

there is not aid to expand the war is it fair to the contras if they want a ceasefire it is it provides food shelter clothing and medicine it provides a credible delivery system it provides for some

here mo udall missed being here by 13 days that is the cutoff point he won a special election 13 days later but those 21 must have sat here and the house did not have responsibility then that was all

name fernando something his code name was pepe his words on april 19 the day it was all collapsing as two sovietexcuse the freudiantwo cuban given by us t33 jets which had been turned into p80 shooting star fighters because they put the 455caliber machine guns back in the nose our intelligence did not see that even with the best satellites you cannot see what is happening in hangars they were strafing the beach and they had tanks on the bluffs they were raking thesepeople in the crossfire so the beach commander the enrique bermudez of that operation who miraculously survives to this

dealing with in a wealthy home in the chicago area as young lads they were doing the manual of arms with it and a little 13yearold girl a family friend appeared in the doorway and he inexplicablynobody could figure out kids do strange thingshe picked up the rifle and fired at the young girl and struck her between the eyes killing her dead on the spot without being an amateur psychiatrist people have analyzed for years that that incident which haunted his life a few weeks later as though she were still alive the little girl as though she were still alive in the letters that were found with no mention that he had killed her accidentally a few weeks before some people say that is why he was never able to come to a decision but he was in the u n and called up president kennedy and said how can you embarrass me with this incident he had been clued in on the intelligence operation of trying to liberate the cubans from 30 years of horrors and aids the aids epidemic that they brought back from central africa the killing of black young men and women freedom fighters that they are doingengaged in right now with soviet officers in angola right now that summer offensive is still trailing off with the forces of freedom probably going to win that one or at least fight to a standstill until the next dry season when the soviets will put in more armor more migs and more commanders down to the company and battalion level but with this order of adlai stevenson telling kennedy call off the air cover or i will quit kennedy supposedly a naval officer and a man of action in the south pacific called off the air cover those men were slaughtered i guess the only answer was pepe swim for it baby i do not know how you say that in spanish they started to swim out some of our young coast guardsmen navy men who were driving those landing ships the oldfashioned open type like at tarawa iwo jima with the falp in the front where you hear the bullets hittling tile flap and you are on the other side right before it does down and worrying about whether a bullet is going to catch you in the face some of those men came into the beach and circled under firewe lost some of thoseand tile men that survived that sinking got out and made it to other landing barges and they went out to the coast now what was classified top secret until recently is the unitedstates aircraft carrieri asked tom moorer in our republican study committee hearings if this was all true because he was then commander of the joint chiefs of staff from 1972no he was in a naval assignment he was commander in the pacific later in the seventies he became the chairman of the joint chiefs i said was not the unitedstatess essex not off the coast with the promised air cover he said yes i said did they not have the navy version of the f86 sabres called the fk fury on the decks ready loaded with bombs and bullets to give help to those men on tile beaches yes he said and i said were those planes spraypainted with the american insignias off as though they would be part of this strange covert operation of these mysterious unmarked you know americanprofile jet fighters shooting down the two t33s and buzzing the beach and he said yes absolutely what is also not known by most people in this or the other body is that the alabama national guard played a role in that because they were then flying obsolete b26 dodglas invader bombers they took them off active duty you know you put the resignation down in the bottom drawer of the squadron commander they went to nicaragua and appeared hence this obsession of castro to crush nicaragua and make it communist someday out of nicaragua a long 6 7hour flight to the combat zone these men from the alabama guard flew these older b26s they were to hit and take out the cuban air force on the evening of april 16 to set up the invasion the next day on the 17th they were sharpthey pulled off that raid and they did not catch these t33s with the guns in them making them shooting star fighters then the next day they came back the t33s shot down the alabama guard b26s one of the commanders one of the pilots a colorful character known all through the guard squadrons of the united states at that time because he weighed over 250 pounds was named riley shamberger you could not miss his portly body his body his corpse laid there in the wreckage of his b26 castro went over and put his foot on captain riley shambergers corpse and bragged about his t33s had shot down the one little effort of our air power used on the eve of this bay of pigs tragedy in our history and kennedy said he will never again believe anybody in government he got his answer quickly the next year with the missile crisis of october when nucleartipped missiles were in cuba what is the lesson we ought to learn from that here is the advice and i solicit please your comments what i would have done had i been president kennedy was i would have said look the men are getting slaughtered and if we are not going to give them air cover to try and make a successful beachhead and see if the people will get rid of this communist castro who betrayed his revolution as did he and his brother and the ortega brothers have we must at least give air cover to the rescue operation lets startlets call it a failure and lets extract these cuban lads that we put on the beach the 2506 brigade i will never forget president kennedy in the orange bowl holding up the flag which the survivors begged for years and finally got back from senator ted kennedy and kennedy held up that flag and said someday this banner will fly again over a free cuba holding up the banner that they rescued off the beach in the last terrible moments when we deserted them if i had been president kennedy i would have said extract them give them cover and try to save as many lives as we can because i have decided not to give air cover to the military operation you and i mr burton flew in honduran jets last september september 5 we flew in those little casa 101s one of them had a c47 painted on the side where they had shot down a drug airplane we saw the morale of those pilots the commander navarro who i flew with you flew with one of the young squadron commanders what the gentleman did not see and what i saw on a subsequent trip up at la ceiba on the coast were the ones flying the israeli super mysteres the very planes that turned back the arab attempt to annihilate israel in the lighting war of 1967 those young pilots when i went and walked in if i squinted i would not have told them from americans or british or fighter pilots anywhere in the world those young guys are straining at the bit tonight as we speak to take the few viable super mysteres that are left and go down to that nicaraguan border never penetrate their airspace just defend the sovereign soil of honduras and shoot those an26s and mi17s out of the air and the only reason they are probably not going down there is because president azcona whom we met with the next night and told him of our flying with his great young pilots in the honduran air force is wondering if we are going to follow through are we going to do to honduras what we did to thailand and malaysia pull out of this whole mess and stare down the barrel of this hemisphere and watch the consolidation of another communist country and then duartes fragile democracy begin to unravel as the farabundo marti continue their newly returned urban terror what are we going to do i suggest the least the president can do and i am telling him this through tile television in front of the american people who track this house the very least we should do is unleash the honduran fighter pilots many of them trained in this country their planes reworked up here in texas to keep them flyable these 25yearold frenchbuilt mysteres if we will not unleash them and not get them involved but just back them up that we will protect for example their bases at palmerola and la ceiba if we will not do that much then i think we owe it to ricky bermudez who stood in that hallway when i asked george miller of california to conic out and at least meet the military commander and he says i am not going to meet with any of your thugs dornan we owe it to bcrmudez and his men to maybe violate their airspace not to prosecute with some military operation but to do the minimum that kennedy failed to do and that is to give cover even if it is with our navy airplanes introducing combat americans only in a rescue operation to tell these hondurans lets get out of it we are getting the men out we are getting the nicaraguan kids out of there we are going to give them cover and extract them in amnerciful rescue operation and there would not be ally shooting if we told ortega you win this round you commie you communist you but you had better back off and let us get these kids out of there that we put in there and we will bring them to

to do is to read the democratic study groups letter that they sent to the peace groups where it says and i quote like the refusal to provide more military aid these provisions send a strong message to

to fly in the face of an agreement that was reached in the 1985 farm bill promises were made in the last congress the dairy industry got the whole herd buyout program when it accepted the prospect of a reduction in the support price level if purchases of surplus products remained high after the buyout the levels of surplus are still unacceptably high congress should not now turnaround and tell the cattle industry and others that a deal made last year is null and void now section 662 is a poorly conceived solution to whatever problem is perceived because of casein imports certainly decisions about agriculture price supports should be made in agriculture legislation not hidden behind the pretense of trade and with the uruguay gatt negotiation coming up shortly the relationship between casein and the ills of the dairy industry can certainly better be addressed at that time but trade is not at the heart of this issue the issue is the anxiety in the dairy industry about being weaned even slightly from their price supports i understand that anxiety but the evidence is clear the supports as constructed are insensitive to market constraints they are damaging to the consumer as well as related industries and they result in massive over supplies of dairy commodities the plan outlined in the farm bill was designed to reduce the dairy surplus in the most sensitive way possible but the problems are real and real solutions are what is needed not delays or evasions it may be a bitter pill for them to swallowbut sometimes whats good for us doesnt always taste so good it would be impossible to construct an argument to say that the 50cent reduction in price supports could do any serious harm to the industry if we dont stick with the farm bill agreement and lower price supports then its possible that another supply adjustment program will be needed that is the worst possible answer to surplus commodity problems the pain of price support cuts to industry pales in comparison to the pain experienced by other industries as a result of the buyout according to the farm bureau the supply and demand imbalance is improving as a result of the buyout program this is therefore the

mines or other bloodletting that would not leave any persian fingerprints in the blood today i would like to continue this series of speeches on the persian gulf by talking about another dangerthe worst case scenario its easy to imagine what the worst case is its simply that we get sucked into the maelstrom of the iraniraq war and end up as a participant rather than an innocent bystander it may be a little harder however to conceive of how we would be sucked into that war let me outline just how that could come about but to begin we need a little background to understand how the worst could occur first one must understand that there are two facets to the irantlraq warthe ground war and the tanker war in the ground war the iranians are on top they are not winning in the sense that they have the iraqis on the ropes but they do have the iraqis on the defensiveand baghdad has no way of changing that because it is unwilling to risk the huge number of casualties that would result if it went onto the offensivean offensive that might take thousands of square miles of iranian territory but which still would not have any assurance of knocking iran out of the war in the tanker war on the other hand it is iraq that is on top and has iran on the defensive the point of the tanker war is economicpure and simple iran depends on oil exports for 95 percent of its foreign exchange earnings and 100 percent of its oil exports must go by tanker through the persian gulf if taq can shut dbwn alit or mosti ortbhrans oil iexports it can shut down irans economy and i make it impossible for iran to sustain the war i efforv indefinitely curiously baghdad has nor pressed its tanker blitz to that conclusion for years its soviettrained pilots made only sporadic strikes at kharg island the terminal for 90 percent of irans oil exports they would fly at altitudes measured in miles rather than feet and make ineffective strikes then about 2 years ago pilots trained in france began graduating and returning home to pilot newly bought mirage f1 jets they were a different breed last summer baghadad began a concerted campaign against tankers against kharg and against the temporary leading terminals that iran tried to paste together when kharg started taking a serious battering iran suffered a dramatic production drop from an average of almost 2 3 million barrels a day in the first half of 1986 iranian oil production fellto an average of 1 3 million barrels a day last august september and october since lranconsumes from 600 000 to 700 000 barrels a day of its own production that meant iranian oil exportsand hence iranian foreign exchange earningswere more than halved exports dropped from about 1 6 million barrels a day to about 0 6 million that was all as a result of the intense iraqi air campaign but that campaign ended in november iranian production rose again and it has now retumed to 2 3 million barrels a day why did baghdad halt what was a very successful air campaign no one knows for certain but there is a strong suspicion that baghdads alliesalong the south shore of the persian gulf greatly feared one thing that an iran battered badly by iraqs economic offensive would strike harshly at the handiestand weakesttargets which are baghdads allies along the south shore of the persian gulf the only realistic way for baghdad to bring this war to an end on anything approaching satisfactory conditions for itself is to cut irans oily umbilical cord tehrans response has been to vocalize one fundamental foreign policy repeatedly the persian gulf and the strait of hormuz will be open and available to all or to none in other words if you allow our throat to be cut we will cutyour throat baghdad will be free to prosecute the air war to a successful conclusion only if the arab states of the persian gulf dont have to worry about an interruption of their commerce that could happen if arab shipping in the gulf were for example protected by the superpowers if say the united states or the soviet union were to protect all that shipping the arab states might no longer feel a need to restrain baghdad and baghdad would feel free to push the air attacks on kharg island and iranian shipping to a crisis point at that point who knows what would happen all bets are off about iranianm rationality it could sue for peace it could strike out against us in the persian gulf it could suffer another revolution promoted by economic chaos from baghdads position none of those outcome is bad from our standpoint one of those outcomes is obviously very bad e15436 june 2 1 987 co so ft worst case scenario of our involvement in the persian gulf reflagging is that we serve as a shield for the gulf states behind which the iraqis are free to fight the war they can winand that as a result iran is pushed to the wall and responds by striking out at us repeatedly dragging us into the war this shield scenario is a possible outcome though by no means a certain outcome but american policymakers need to think through the foreign policy chess match to logical conclusions and not just play it one move at a time which is a proscription for being on the receiving end of a checkmate incidentally the analogy is appropriate checkmate is generally believed to be a corruption of a persian term shah mord meaning the king is dead the iranians would certainly love to checkmate us now let me emphasize that there is more than one way for the chess match to play out the shield gambit doesnt necessarily come into play if we protect only 11 of the tankers plying the gulf tehran can still strike at many other vesselspanamanian greek cypriot et ceterathat call at kuwaiti oil terminals tehran is also free to hit ships of many flags that call at the ports in the other arab states along the persian gulf however defense secretary caspar weinberger spoke to a news conference and later to the house armed services committee about the possibility of protecting all neutral shipping in the persian gulf which indicates that the administration failed to work through all the moves in the chess games before it approved the reflagging plan i have also been told that the adminsitration spoke to kuwait and offered to protect all kuwaiti shipping it was the kuwaitis who said they were only interested in reflagging 11 of their 22 tankers after considerable confusion and toingandfroing the administration finally appears to have recognized the shield problem the very first sentence of last weeks defense department report to congress on security arrangements in the persian gulf addresses that issue protecting 11 kuwati ships under the unitedstates flag is not part of an openended unilateral american commitment to defend all nonbelligerent shipping in the persian gulf the fact that this is the opening sentence of a 35page report indicates the importance the administration now realizes it must attach to limiting this program it also shows how the administration trapped intself in its own rhetoric officially the administration argues that the reflagging is part of an effort to a guarantee freedom of navigation in the persian gulf and b protect the flow of oil guarding 11 of the hundreds of vessels that ply the waters of the persian gulf helps those 11 tankers but does very little for the grander concepts of guaranteeing freedom of navigation and protecting the flow of oil those two arguments drive one logically to a policy of providing protection for all neutral shipping in the persian gulfwhich is how secretary weinberger found himself offering total protection which in turn meant providing a shield behind which iraq could beat iran into submission by changing tune as the administration has now done we avoid becoming a de facto ally of baghdad by providing that military shield but the fact that the administration had to change its tune also indicates that the administration had not thought through its policy before it started enunciating it mind you this is not a case where time pressures forced an administration to patch together a policy in days the administrations own chronology shows that kuwait formally informed the unitedstates embassy in kuwait of its interest in reflagging on december 23 1986 two months later in the first week of march the president approved an interagency recommendation to protect the kuwait tankers three months later secretary weinberger was speaking of protecting all neutral shipping in the gulf so the policy is not to confine all escort service to 11 kuwaiti tankers reflagged ameri can what happens next as i noted in the first speech in this series last wednesday the likelihood of a direct iranian attack on a ship flying the american flag is remote one thing the iranians might domight be doing is to drop mines in channels plied by unitedstates flag vessels since may 17 four ships have struck mines all have been in the channel leading to kuwaits main oil terminal mina alahmadi where our escort will have ended this raises the prospect that we will safely escort a ship for 600 miles wave it goodbye turn around and sail off only to hear a loud boom behind us we would look rather silly this highlights two points first we must consider not only the possibility of loss of life but also of getting egg all over our face and second the government of kuwait has a definite role here in providing at absolute minimum protection for shipping in its territorial waters kuwait is perfectly capable of doing that it has four dozen patrol craft in its navy plus six fast attack missile boats carryingof all thingsexocet missiles one of these 255ton ships bears the unfortunate name alboom miningor dropping the occasional mine in a shipping channelis one tactic the iranians may already be pursuing a second possibility is that they will simply attack ships flying flags other than the stars and stripes eleven tankers will be safe but hundreds of others will be subject to attackand may in fact have suddenly become more inviting targets what do we do if all around the gulf other shipping is being attacked by the iranians the opinion will quickly evolve that our reflagging of kuwati vessels has made the gulf much less safe for all but 11 ships what do we do has the administration thought through this chess gambit are we going to ignore this development if we really believe in freedom of navigation and the free flow of oil dont we have to do something to help out the other countries four of whichall but saudi arabiaare even smaller in population than kuwait if we do help we risk building a shield for iraq incrementally if we dont act we look a bit silty guarding 11 tankers while others burn around us in sum the administration didnt really think through this reflagging policy before adopting it it leaped before it looked the remarks of the defense secretary reflect a failure to understand the implications of providing a shield for baghdads war on iranian tankers and there is no indication that the administration has thought through what it will do if iran responds in a very logical fashion by turning its guns on ships other than the protected 11"], [0.9999082007125253, 9.179928747471422e-05, 1, "i move to strike the requisite number of words i can already anticipate the outcome of this

archeological site a prohibited activity under arpa this change will allow the prosecution of looters who are caught digging but who havent yet retrieved ihe object third it will strike the requirement under current law that an artifact must be of archaeological interest this provision of current law only confuses juries and injects a subjective view of archeological resources into the

control second for recreation bibb county has constructed beaches pavilions and has licensed a marina a restaurant a water slide camping areas and other facilities the total cost of the project was

built 75 000 housing units have been built and rehabilitated 135 industrial parks have been built more than 1 300 sewer and water projects have been completed there are more jobs more people less poverty better health and better education while there still are pockets of povery in appalachia it is no longer a stepchild of the united states there are in place other programs that can help with the specific individualized pockets that remain so why do we retain a single regional development commission when in fact this area of the country has no corner on hardship why are we unable to sunset a 22year old program that has fulfilled its mission when we are in a condition of budget distress and the american people are asking us to balance their budget i think it is time to vote yes on this amendment and to begin the process of going into every appropriation bill and finding every possible alternative where we can cut if my colleagues feel as though they have been singled out here go into the bill and find another area i think it is time for us to be involved as the body at large recognizing and appreciating as we do the work of the appropriation committee but still nevertheless all of us in this body have a stake in trying to find a way for the american people to make cuts it is as the gentleman said a small cut 110 million during all of those years when this enormous federal budget grew we heard about a billion here a billion there and it adds up as we try to cut it down let us say a billion here a billion there and pretty soon it will add down we have to get our fiscal house in order we have to control the deficit we have to do that 110 million at a time and we have to do that with the full participation of the body in that regard i want again to express my appreciation to the gentleman from new hampshire and urge a yes vote"], [0.006232023239135742, 0.5062320232391357, 1, "i want to thank the dean of our delegation don edwards for taking this special order to pay tribute to our dear friend sala burton when phil burton died a few years ago i referred to him here on the house floor as the father of the california delegation i said that he had wrapped himself in a protective way around the delegation as a whole and around us as individual members and had truly fought for usthe issues we cared about and the progress of our careers he of course was an ambitious man but much of his ambition was for california and for his colleagues if phil was the father of the delegation then salawho had stood by him during his career in congresswas the mother of our delegation she played that role before succeeding phil here in the house and she surely played it as a member in her own right she of course cared cared deeplyabout the issues those of us from california and elsewhere have fought for in recent years i served with her on the select committee on hunger and her compassion and directness made her a leader of the committee in its first few years of existence i also worked with her in our efforts to protect her beloved california coast from those who would permit oil drilling regardless of the impact on this precious national coastal resource but to sala our work here in congress was only a part of her responsibility while phil wanted to help us in our careers sala attended to the other side she cared about us as people she cared about our families she regularly asked how our families were doing how we were doing how our spouses and children were doing and how we were all getting along she knew better than anyone the pressures a career in congress place on a family and she reminded us of the need to focus on our families not just our work here in the house as a son of immigrants i felt a particularly close kinship to sala i saw in her the same instincts i saw in my own parentsthe kindness the toughness the compassion she made each of us members of her family and she truly looked out for us i think if there is any one thing that characterized sala it would beas with most mothers i thinka sense of compassion we struggle here every day with the politics of the issues we deal with but too often we forget about the people we are trying to help not sala the peopleparticularly those in the greatest need of our helpwere her first concern when it came to an issue this was true in her work on the select committee on hunger and it was true in her work on the rules committee i think its clear that members of this body from both sides of the aisle and of all ages will truly miss sala burton my wife sylvia joins me in expressing our deepest sympathies to salas family and we thank her and phil for the example they set for us over the years"], [0.007443785667419434, 0.49255621433258057, 1, "i rise simply to express my appreciation for the consideration of this matter by the committee and in doing it so promptly and thoroughly i rise in strong support of s 854 the nevadaflorida land exchange authorization act this legislation authorizes the exchange of lands owned by the aerojet corp in south dade county fl for federally owned lands in nevada the florida lands would then be sold to the south florida water management district with the proceeds to be used for land acquisition in unitedstates wildlife refuges in florida as a cosponsor of the legislation i believe it is good for all concerned it not only severs a national interest but it benefits both florida and nevada in particular aerojet would gain land it needs to proceed with rocket development for our nations defense and space programs the department of the interior will obtain revenue for the purchase of lands necessary for the preservation pf endangered wildlife without the need for an appropriation of new funds and the state of florida will become owner of property immediately east of everglades national park the water management district which administers the central and southern florida flood control project for the army corps of engineers intends to manage water flows over this property in a manner designed to restore the natural water regime of the parka stated goal of the national park service with respect to the funds derived from the sale of the property to the water management district these moneys are specifically designated by the legislation to be used for land acquisition in national wildlife refuges in florida it would be my sincere hope that a good portion of the money will be used for the key deer national wildlife refuge in the florida keys although established in 1957 to protect the highly endangered key deer much of the land within the boundaries of the refuge remains in private ownership and now faces considerable development pressure it is estimated that 5 million is required this year to purchase the most vulnerable of these properties since this is a great deal of money to be appropriated at a time of very stringent budget cuts the use of funds from the sale of the aerojet property will be a tremendous help in this effort i wish to commend the chairman of the subcommittee on national parks and public lands mr vento for his outstanding work on this legislation he has given us a bill that is environmentally sound and that makes good sense for all of the reasons i have already indicated i urge our colleagues to vote for it"], [0.010373532772064209,

ironically the sandinistas did not even dispute the story on the contrary the nicaraguan defense minister humberto ortego daniels brother confirmed all of its substance in a speech on saturday in fact the comhl11419 mandante stated that the sandinista goal was not a half million persons under arms but 600 000 people an article in the washington post quotes observers as saying that although these protocols are rationalized by the sandinistas as a defense against united states invasion the real reason is to perfect the means to control nicaraguas population of 3 million if carried out these

i also understand this difficult question in the terms of the first amendment religious freedom the struggle for freedom in this country has been the struggle against intrusive government now it happens that the catholic faith as i understand it does not approve of homosexuality now i can understand a catholic university not wishing to formally recognize an organization that is designed to promote advocate advance a practice that is deemed by them to be sinful that is far removed from individuals who may or may not practice that lifestyle whom we are taught to love and to pray for and hope that they will pray for us but the first amendment is so important and it says congress not only shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion nor prohibit the free exercise thereof and i was so sorry to see georgetown fail to vindicate their free exercise of religion to cooperate in determining what that really means under our constitution i read the letter from father healy the legal action was costing an arm and a leg and there were all sorts of reasons for them to abandon its defense but the vindication of the first amendment religious freedom for a university that has a set of beliefs which ought to be vindicated and ought to stand supreme over a city counsil that says you shall recognize a group even though it advocates practices and beliefs which are inimical to

exposed to highly toxic substances and chemicals in the workplace i think it goes almost beyond good faith debate to try to trivialize the issue by making reference to the sun being the equivalent of methylisocyanate or something else that you will find in the workplace that ranks right up there with those who have said that there is not need for pollution control because trees are the ultimate polluters i think it is fairly clear that we have a serious problem it is appalling that we have waited too long to address it and this bill quite candidly is just a preliminary effort to try to deal with the key fact of notification it does not even deal with removing the problem it deals with mere notification identification and notification the rational expectation being that someone will be able to detect the problems earlier and then take remedial action to try to deal with the problem before there is a need for even greater expenditure from wherever they come to deal with health problems in a sense this bill represents a natural extension of the community right to know act that was overwhelmingly approved in a bipartisan way last year by this congress and signed into law by the president the right to know act provided essential comparable information to our communities living next door as they might to manufacturing and other industrial operations about the routine exposure that those communities may have to chemicals coming from those facilities that may cause shortterm or longterm injuries in a sense what we are doing is extending that same fundamental right to the workers who work within the facilities that we have already granted to citizens who live around those facilities i want to emphasize and perhaps focus in on an aspect of this that is being allegedly addressed by the substitute that is being offered the socalled liability crisis the suggestion has been made that this bill will lead to enormous litigation costs that is clearly not the case our committee the committee that i chair the subcommittee on commerce consumer protection and competitiveness has been holding a series of hearings on the whole question of the need for the scope of federal product liability reform and the issue of toxic exposure has played a critical role in our deliberations as i read this bill h r 162 this will neither add or substract from the rights of workers who wish to seek damages in the state court systems for occupational diseases by contrast the substitute will substantially radically and dramatically change and curtail the rights of workers to seek relief from injuries that are currently being provided now it is those rights that are currently provided in the state courts this will effectively preempt the state rules of evidence that exist we will be having the workmans compensation system changes the state tort laws will be changed and we will have the somewhat perverse result being that workers who are notified who have substantially differing sets of rights in the state tort law system than workers who are not notified i think that dual track system will be particularly strange likewise we will have a system where workers who are notified as contrasted with workers who are not notified as contrasted with someone out on a road who is exposed to the same chemcial as a result of the truck accident we will have three different sets of rights under state tort laws for those here who are interested in states rights for those few states that i know already have changed their states tort laws we are going to be undoing all that is going on at the state level as a result of this effective federal preemption in a sense that is what some would want to do i give no bad faith motives to anyone but some who might be supportive of this type of substitute are effectively trying to bootstrap intrusive federal reforms of state tort law on to people of this country without any type of deliberation without any type of understanding as to the ramifications of that very dramatic change in the laws of this nation here at the 11th hour under an amendment that sounds somewhat innocuous but in fact will provide for radical changes in the laws of our 50 states without the appropriate deliberations that i think these changes are certainly due"], [0.013814002275466919, 0.4861859977245331, 0, "the largest issue
