{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time as a member of the joint economic committee i rise today to speak on the economic policies of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [1.7881393432617188e-07, 0.9999998211860657, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding every justification of the budget we have heard today presents it as a noble and responsible attempt to respond to the harsh economic realities facing our nation and our people but when we examineit objectively we cant avoid seeing the reality behind the pretense the bill is designed to do everything it can to protect the record tax cuts for the richest of americans for the majority that is more important than educating our children or providing health care to the veterans or helping americans raise themselves out of poverty or even protecting our country from the consequences of either national disasters or mounting national debt the authors and supporters of the legislation will tell us that if we wish to avoid increasing our national deficit which they have already driven to unprecedented heights we have no choice but to spend on the programs that americans rely on the most while they are busily cutting out the revenues that come into the government but once again they are offering a false choice for 5 years they have forced the massive tax cuts through the congress last week they made the most recent down payment on the cuts one was 70 billion while president bush signs that bill into law today republicans are asking us to pass this bill which adds another 158 billion to those cuts so in 2 weeks we have made those massive cuts and any justification melts away when we realize who is benefiting from it they are not for the poor they are not for the working class they are not for the middle class they are for the oil companies they wont spur our economy or help the average person afford their morning drive to work they are instead the cuts for billionaires and millionaires pure and simple they are not going to help the economy but they will indeed help people who dont need it and that assistance will come at the expense of everyone else but as always the case despite objections not just from democrats but much of the american public reducing or extending these cuts isnt even on the table here it never is they are considered too sacred to touch and just tonight in the rules committee once again we turned down an opportunity to pay for more by taking away part of their tax cut what do we get in exchange for this giveaway well the majority offered us a budget that will cut domestic spending between 1 and 2 percent every year as a result the party that tells us to support the troops is cutting veterans health care by 6 billion and we worry and fear for the over 20 000 young soldiers in iraq and afghanistan who have been grievously lifealtering wounded will not be able to get the care they need when they come back republicans who promised to leave no child behind will be cutting education funding by 45 3 billion and the budget of the department of education by 2 2 billion now not content to make education less rewarding in the present they apparently want to make our students worry more about loan payments in the future the bill eliminates all mandatory spending on student loans leaving congressional appropriators to somehow find 600 million to meet the students needs the majority wants to cut environmental protection efforts by 25 billion and take over 1 billion from community development and social service initiatives which we desperately need the poorest of the poor wont find any relief at all in this legislation in fact they will find the opposite the budget will underfund housing and child care assistance by 447 million over the next year and over 5 years the funding for them will fall almost 15 billion short what will the results be well consider the fate of the commodity supplemental food program which provides nutritious meals to 420 000 lowincome elderly and 50 000 mothers and children at a cost of 111 million a year the budget eliminates it entirely it may make sense that they are forcing the cuts through congress so they can afford the handouts to the rich but perhaps that really is what todays republican party stands for but apparently they also stand for something new contrary to their rhetoric irresponsible government spending the legislation before us will increase our deficit without a vote by 410 billion over the next 5 years at the same time it increases the debt limit by over 650 billion by 2011 the limit will stand at 9 6 trillion when the clinton administration left office the debt limit was about 4 5 trillion and they left us the greatest surplus we have ever had the majority claims the bill will make us more fis cally secure but what they really do is sow the seeds of greater insecurity both now and for years to come when we realize that it isnt necessity driving this bill but rather a world view that puts the richest americans ahead of everybody else we are not left with much else to say but shame we dont share these values democrats believe instead as did that great republican president theodore roosevelt and countless other americans that investing in the middle class which is disappearing quickly and guaranteeing broad prosperity is the surest way to ensure sustained economic growth"], [1.7881393432617188e-07, 0.9999998211860657, 1, "this evening ason each tuesday evening i rise on behalf of the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition a grdup of 37 of us that are fiscally conservative democrats that are concerned about the state of affairs in america we are concerned about the debt the deficit the budget and we are committed to trying to restore some common sense and fiscal discipline to our nations government and our nations budgeting process ever since i was a small child growing up in prescbtt emmet and hope arkansas i always heard it was the democrats that spent the money and yetit was a president named bill clinton from arkansas from my hometown of hope arkansas in fact that gave this nation its first balanced budget in 40 years from 1988 through 2001 america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having its fiscal house in order america enjoyed the prosperity that came with having a balanced budget it is hard now to believe that from 1998 through 2001 this country had a balanced budget because as we all know for the sixth year in a row this nation under this republicanled congress and under this president this administration has given us the largest budget deficit ever ever in our nations history for a sixth year in a row as a matter of fact as you walk the halls of congress it is easy to spot a fiscally conservative democrat because the 37 of us who belong to the blue dog coalition have this poster outside our office in the halls of congress as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 365 525 832 151 and some change that is a big number let us put it in a way that we all can understand it for every man woman and child including those born this 1ast hour every citizen of americas share of the national debt is 28 000 and some change where i come from very few of my constituents can afford to write a check for 28 000 and yet it is this kind of debt this kind ofdeficit that we are saddling on our children and grandchildren and expectingther someday to pay back and i believe it is morally wrong i raise these issues because you see my grandparents left this country better than they found it for my parents and my parents left this country better than they found it for my generation and i believe we have a duty and an obligation to try and leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for the next generation but instead for the sixth year in a row we have the largest budget deficit ever inour nations history this administration this republican congress continues to pass tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year just in the last few months this congress passed the socalled budget deficit reduction act here is~what it did it cut medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor disabled and elderly it cut student loans and a program for orphans to the tune of 40 billion and then they passed another tax cut to the tune of about 90 billion i was not real good in math in high school or college but you can do the math on that some 90 billion in tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year 40 billion in cuts to medicaid to orphan programs and to student loans that amounts to 50 billion in additional debt and yet the republican leadership in this body had the nerve to call it the deficit reduction act i believe it is time for those of us in the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition to rise up and hold this administration this congress responsible for these kinds of reckless spending habits that destroy future generations the budget the president has submitted for fiscal year 2007 some 2 8 trillion you have to givelit to him he has managed to cut all of the programs that matter to people health care education infrastructure economic development and yet give us the largest budget deficit ever in our nations history all at the same time how does he do that because he continues to propose to borrow money from foreign lenders foreign central banks foreign investors to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year what has it given us it has given us a debt of 8 365 525 832 151 by the time we complete this hour the national debt will have risen more than 41 million every tuesday night those of us in the blue dog coalition we are 37 members strong we come here to talk about the debt and the deficit and what it means not only to todays generation but to future generations because you see these are big numbers they are big numbers but let me put it in perspective not only is our nation borrowing about a billion dollars a day we are sending 279 million every day to iraq but do not dare ask the president how he is spending it or if he has a plan for how it is to be spent because he will tell you that you are unpatriotic some 57 million is going every day to afghanistan and on top of that our nation is spending the first half a billion we collect in your tax money each and every day simply to pay interest not principal just interest on the national debt we need 149 in my congressional district i need 1 5 billion to complete it give me 3 days interest on the national debt i can build 149 on the eastern side we are waiting on 169 give me 3 days interest on the national debt and i can complete 169 and with these two interstates we can bring economic opportunities and jobs to one of the most depressed and distressed areas of the country these are the kinds of priorities that should be americas priorities that continue to go unmet

what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american

deserve a clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that today so i urge my colleagues to reject this rule i reserve the balance of my time"],

for organizing this series of 5minute statements and for his leadership on this issue two weeks short of the end of the fiscal year of 2006 and with no budget in place for fiscal 2007 i commend my distinguished democratic colleagues on the budget committee for takingthis time to call americas attention to the fiscal challenges resulting from the republicans misguided policies and the wrong choices they have made for our economy misplaced spending priorities and bad decisions have consequences they are leading us further down the path to fiscal ruin and expanding the wedge between middleclass families and the superwealthy i am proud to join my colleagues to highlight the hypocrisy of the overriding republican economic philosophy that extending dividends capital gains and other tax cuts for millionaires and corporations create a rising tide that lifts all boats five years after the presidents 1 5 trillion tax cut our national debt now approaches 10trillion if our tax cuts performed as promised by those across the aisle an exploding economy would have wiped out this debt we have already proven that more needs to be done than just hope that sooner or later tax cuts will reach americans who need help the most but those who do need help must get in line and hope that the benefits of tax cuts for millionaires and corporations will ultimately trickle down to them perhaps the expanding gulf between the haves and the almosthaves is best illustrated by the fact that wages and salaries now make up the lowest share of gross domestic product since the government began keeping records on that in 1947 while corporate profits continue to break alltime records meanwhile the buying power of the minimum wage has sunk to its lowest level in 50 years what is missing are policies that ensure that the benefits of higher corporate earnings productivity and globalization are widely shared such as real government support for higher education a progressive tax code and affordable health care when choices are made at the expense of our safety net choices that benefit the top 1 percent who will never struggle to pay a mortgage never struggle to keep up with gas prices never struggle to put their children through school it is clear that a new direction for our economy is long overdue how can the republicans argue that this economy is bound in the right direction when our nation is saddled with recordbreaking deficits over 4 consecutive years combined with deep and painful cuts to hospitals to schools and to security at least the republicans budget outlook since 2001 has been consistent americans could bank on the american budgets to slash funding for proven homeland security programs veterans benefits education and health care priorities all the while cutting taxes for millionaires who need the break the least as reallife indicators of poor federal spending choices such as stagnant wages soaring crime rates and rising health care premiums and drug prices begin to take their toll on americans it is our responsibility to react instead inaction reigns under the direction of the current leadership in some cases this inaction has yielded to halfhearted solutions such as an energy bill that does more for oil aild gas companies than lower gas prices a medicare bill that does more for drug companies and hmos than make lifesaving drugs affordable a pension bill that takes it easy on corporate boards while ignoring the decline of traditional defined benefit plans eleven days away from the start of the fiscal year the record of this republican congress on the economy shows that we have not completed a budget or a single appropriations bill fiscal irresponsibility has reached unprecedented new lows depending on how you look at it the debt limit has been raised for the fifth time in as many years to almost 10 trillion perhaps we shouldnt be worried after all the presidents budget director said last month that 200 billion annual deficits are sustainable indefinitely apparently normal budget rules dont apply to this administration but they do apply to a middleclass family of four living on long island whose monthly costofliving expenses due mostly to rising gas prices and health care costs are rapidly exceeding wage increases perhaps their creditors and collection agents will understand that outstanding debts owed by families sinking deeper into red ink are sustainable indefinitely we can fix this mess we have the blueprint a new direction for america and we only need to look to past and proven methods like the payasyougo budget rules that were enforced in the previous administration and produced surpluses that helped us start buying down our national debt indeed we democrats resolve to restore what

the language of earmarks in drafting a limitation amendment to prevent funding to the jari regional business incubator we used the earmark language exactly as it appears in the bill l 1445 we then asked the parliamentarians to review it to make sure it would be in order we were informed that the region business incubator verbiage was too vague to be considered in order so in drafting this amendment we had no choice but to limit funding to jari period the effect of this amendment would be to prohibit any funding from the bill going to the organization whereas our initial intention was to limit the funding to the business incubator that is part of the problem we have here all we have is the language in a report that is so vague or confusing that it is even difficult to draft an amendment to cover it now i have no problem limiting any funding to the organization let me tell you but i also want to be clear that i have nothing against jari i wish the organization well in its

believe because of the attachment of the proposal for the continuity of congress that this bill is by far the worst bill to come to the floor in this session of congress i believe that that continuity of representation provision attached to this bill is an assault on constitutional government i believe it is an assault on checks and balances it is an assault on the rule of law it is an invitation to oneman rule and dictatorship i think it is profoundly misguided profoundly misgotten and i think a profound disservice is done in not having months and months of hearings with constitutional scholarsbefore such a drastic proposal is brought before the house i think there is a very good reason that the senate has not taken it up it is because it is a turkey of a proposal it could leave us literally with 75 and 80 percent of the congressional districts in this country unrepresented in a time of crisis at a time of terrorist attack and unrepresented in the halls of congress and i think that is a bad way to do business what i would like to do now is to talk about another problem in this bill that is the congressional visitors center i really believe that the congressional visitors center has been mismanaged in such spectacular fashion that it is really sort of a metaphor for the way that the entire federal budget deficit has been mismanaged and let me explain what i mean this project originally started as a 95 million project to have a modest expansion of the capitol to give tourists an opportunity to come in and see a movie about what the congress was all about before they visited thb capitol but the security assault on this capitol and 9 11 has in my view been used as an excuse to expand this operation we have also had other efforts from the library of congress and other institutions to further expand this proposition and so as a result today this project is a 500 millionplus project it is more than a year behind schedule and i think it is wasting taxpayers money and wasting an opportunity that we had to provide muchneeded usable space for the congress at the same time what is happening out on the east front is that over 2 acres of underground spaqe is being added to the capitol some of that is being added for purposes of a visitors center and some of the other space is being added for the purpose of expanding space under control of the senate and the house to do their work we all know that this congress needs more working space in my view the number one need of the congress for working space is the need for additional rooms for conference committees between the senate and the house because most of our hearings especially on the committee on appropriations when i came here they were held behind closed doors the press was not in the public was not in so there was plenty of room for a few people to get behind closed doors and work out deals and that is not the way government is supposed to work today today when we have a conference committee the press has a right to be there we need our staffs there and the public has the right to be there too we have no real room in the capitol for that kind of facility this is an opportunity to create that kind of room instead what has happened instead the only appreciable room of any quality in the new house space is what is called the house hearing room but in plain language that room is really a media center that is going to be where the press focuses whenever there is a hearing in that room because it will have all of the creature comforts for the press that room will have ample room for one hearing one presentation and whoever runs the congress will be able to decide what subject it is that gets that attention if you are trying to hold another public hearing on another subject in the capitol you are going to be stuck in tiny rooms that are worthless in terms of public access when i visited the visitors center i asked the architect why with these vaulted ceilings that you have set aside for this hearing room why could you not simply reduce the height of those rooms and at least provide two rooms of approximately the same size so that we had enough overflow room for the committees to do our work and to have conference committees i have yet to get an answer from the architects office that is my problem my problem is that with all of this space being created much of it is not usable for the purpose that we need it used for then we come to the other portion of the addon which is the portion devoted to the visitors center originally that visitors center was supposed to have two media theaters so that the public could come in see a short film about the congress and then be on its way here is the problem we have those two small orientation theaters but in addition to that we have this huge congressional auditorium which is going to seat 450plus people i asked the architect and this is a vaulted theater i asked why do we need another theater in the capitol what i was told by the architect is well you can bring in large constituency groups i would like to know how many members of the house have ever brought 500 people into the capitol i do not think there are going to be many people would raise their hands the second thing the architect told me is that well we need a place for where the house of representatives can meet when the house chamber is being remodeled e 1615 that i found a might strange because we have just redecorated the committee on ways and means room in the longworth building that room was originally created to serve as an alternative meeting place for the house of representatives when we had to repair this chamber so we have already got a spare room in addition we have another spare room i cannot talk about because it i classified but it is being built off campus somewhere so in essence we will have three spare rooms i do not know how much the offcampus room is costing the taxpayers or how much the committee on ways and means room cost the taxpayers but this room is going to cost a bundle i keep asking what is the real purpose for this room you finally go back 10 years and look at the original plans what do we find out we find out that this was originally included in the plans at the request of the library of congress because they wanted another theater to show movies and give presentations that might be nice for them to have but this project is already 400 percent over original cost i do not think it makes any sense i think this is the last chance that we are going to have to reconfigure this center so we have some additional working space instead of the taj mahal show space we are going to have another thing i do not like we have been told we are likely to have three congressional seals in the new visitors center those seals i have been told will cost up to a million bucks does any member really want to take the political heat when taxpayers find out that somebody is talking about spending 1 million on three congressional seals do members remember the cain that was raised when marble floors were put in four of our elevators in the capitol does anybody have any memory i would like to think so but i guess not i consider myself to be an institutional man i usually support this piece of legislation but out of frustration i am not going to support it today because i think this capitol visitors center when it is finally built is going to draw fliesin terms of bad stories about waste of taxpayer money misuse of space and we are going to wind up not having enough room for the principal function of government if this is indeed supposed to be a working capitol then we ought to be able to do better than this floor plan i really believe this package has been brought to us by staff who do not really understand how committees work and do not really understand the principal needs of this institution this is the last time we are going to have a chance to repair this package and make it more usable for the 100 years at least that it will be used i urge members to vote against this bill so we can start over i reserve the balance of my time"],

fort king this fort played a direct role in the founding of florida as a state secretary of the interior gale norton designated fort king a national historic landmark on february 24 2004 to our great delight then in november 2005 fort king entered a draft special resource study and environmental impact statement public comment period this continues and we look forward to moving fort king along in the process of preservation and now i am working towards preserving fort king in perpetuity as a national park my good friend and colleague in the neighboring district the honorable ric keller who also represents ocala has collaborated with me on this effort historic sites are a vital link between current and future generations of americans and those who came before us these landmarks give context to the national experience and help us understand our past so that we can envision our future what happened at fort king it is a very long story about which i will elaborate longer on another occasion the abbreviated story is that on december 28 1835 fort king was the site of an outbreak of hostilities between the united states government and the seminole indians the seminoles were led in this attack by chief osceola this attack began the second seminole war which lasted longer than any other united states armed conflict except for the vietnam war chief osceolas first appearance to the world was at fort king in october 1834 the defiant young war chief rejected the unitedstates orders to leave florida and threatened war unless the seminoles were left alone there was no trust left between the unitedstates army and the seminoles then came the fateful day of december 28 1835 that morning 40 miles to the south along the fort king road the seminoles ambushed and annihilated two companies of unitedstates army regulars in route to fort king that afternoon osceola shot and killed the indian agent wiley thompson outside the walls of fort king the second seminole war had begun during the 7 year guerrilla war that followed every major general and every regiment of the unitedstates army was stationed at or passed through fort king men who would gain fame in the mexican and civil wars and here stood the enlisted men bemrose clarke and hundreds of others who served in the florida war following the initial series of engagements most of which the seminoles won unitedstates forces withdrew from the interior of florida abandoning fort king in may 1836 the seminoles stood victorious and burned the hated fort king to the ground but it would be a short lived victory when the army returned a year later and rebuilt fort king when it finally ended in 1842 most of the seminoles had been killed or captured and relocated to indian territory in oklahoma these native americans constitute the seminole nation of today an unconquered and defiant few withdrew to the vastness of the florida everglades and survived to the present as the seminole tribe of florida in march 1843 fort king was abandoned by the unitedstates army for the last time and transferred to the people of marion county the fort was used as the countys first courthouse and public building in 1846 it was dismantled by the citizens of marion county for its lumber the great pines had done their job fort king and the surrounding area contain artifacts used in the attack and in the life of the seminole indians preserving our past for our children and grandchildren is imperative fort king is a historical gem that should be accessible to all this site is significant not only in floridas history but to the history of the nation i have been working on advancing fort king through national historic landmark status towards hopeful eventual national park service status for the past several years and am looking forward to see this project come to fruition representative keller and i hope that i can count on the chairmans support to preserve this unique historic site for future generations"],

add language to section 421 the loan forgiveness for service in areas of national need currently this section makes eligible for student loan forgiveness workers in several important jobs and one health carerelated field nursing my amendment would make eligible for loan forgiveness those medical residents that are entering a program lasting more than 5 years and are entering a field that is facing a shortfall in filling those residency positions this amendment will provide medical students with a reason to consider other medical specialties that require more training many medical specialties require 3 or 4 years of training however there are certain specialties and subspecialties that require more training after the initial program for instance in my case as a thoracic surgeon i trained 5 years in general surgery and then another 3 years in thoracic surgery to become a cardiothoracic surgeon current law only provides loan deferment for 3 years for certain medical specialties that means while students are in the middle of their residency they are paying back student loans for many medical students this is a 6oncern and a reason to not pursue certain medical careers in the case of cardiothoracic surgery there are currently about 20 open slots in these residency programs this year and as each year goes by we see fewer and fewer of these positions being filled the situation is similar in other specialties as mentioned earlier with neurosurgery and certain subspecialties of plastic surgery fl 1415 these are specialties that provide vital care to seniors critically ill patients and other vulnerable populations if this trend continues it will lead to a lack of health care access for seniors critically ill patients and other vulnerable populations these patients may see a doctor but not necessarily one that has the experience and adequate training to provide the latest and most effective care my amendment aims to prevent this decline in health care access by providing a small incentive for medical students to enter these professions with a critical need again i want to thank the rules committee and chairman mckeon for considering this amendment i urge my colleagues to support this and i also want to thank my colleague from new jersey who has offered his support aswell i reserve the balance of my time"],

visited walter reed i had the opportunity to visit five mississippians three of whom are amputees all of whom are national guardsmen or reservists as the gentlewoman from california just mentioned over 40 percent of all the people serving in iraq right now are guardsmen and reservists and a disproportionately high percentage of the deaths and wounds have been received by them one way we tried to make it up to them for their supreme sacrifice to our nation was to see to that those guardsmen and reservists who choose to can buy into the tricare health care coverage provided by our nation to every other member of the armed forces the regular soldier to their right the regular marine to their left it was brought up in committee and by a majority vote the armed services committee voted to allow national guardsmen and reservists to buy into tricare but somewhere between the committee and the rules committee someone decided that there was mandatory spending involved so the same congress that has brought 21 bills to this floor that waived all budgetary rules no matter how much it ran up the deficit the same congress that has added 2 2 trillion to the national debt in just 4 years that decided paris hilton can inherit hundreds of millions of dollars without paying a penny in taxes decided because there was 5 million mandatory spending these national guardsmen could no longer buy into that policy so we went to the rules committee we showed the rules committee where the national guard association the military officers association of america the enlisted association of the national guard the adjutant generals of every single state voted unanimously for this amendment the reserve officers association and the fleet reserve association all endorsed this amendment and yet the rules comnittee in a straight party line vote decided that national guardsmen and reservists cannot buy their health care the gentleman from illinois the speaker of the house ignored the call of the adjutant general of illinois and the 12 500 national guardsmen in his state the gentleman from texas ignored the call of his adjutant general and the 20 000 national guardsmen in texas the gentleman from missouri ignored the call of his adjutant general and the 10 000 national guardsmen from missouri the gentleman from california ignored the call of his adjutant general and 20 400 national guardsmen the gentleman from florida ignored the call of 12 000 national guardsmen the list goes on the bottom line is if these people are good enough to serve our nation in iraq if they are going to die in disproportionately high numbers if they are going to lose their limbs in disproportionately high numbers do you not think this congress could find the time to debate an amendment that has already passed the armed services committee and let every member of this body decide whether or not those americans who are serving our country in the guard deserve the opportunity to buy health

homeowners pay about 200 more to heat their homes this means the united states steel for every dollar the price of natural gas goes up costs them 80 million if you are a company and you ask yourself

are demanding that lawmakers increase the supply we cannot afford to continue to have these high gas prices and send jobs to saudi arabia qatar oman iran and russia or let other countries do with natural gas prices like they did with ukraine and double the prices on them we cannot compete as a nation for jobs with this it is no wonder the building trades have come out with a very strongly

important issue and i also thank the gentleman from california for his support for this resolution and for his leadership on many of these foreign relation issues that we hive i am very pleased to be here on the floor today to address this issue and i rise in support of h res 942 to recognize the 100th anniversary of the iranian constitutional revolution the current totalitarian regime of the ayatollahs presents a threat to world peace it is important to recognize that iranian history contains within itself the evidence of internal representative constitutional aspirations which would free the iranian people of oppressive tyranny in 1906 the people of iran brought about a peaceful constitutional revolution to limit the autocratic power of a corrupt regime as such it was among the most significant turning points in iranian history it and resulted in the establishment of an elected parliament the majles andthe creation of a representative system of government including checks and balances and the separation of powers while the constitution that was ultimately drafted as a result of the revolution was never fully implemented in iran it presents the iranian people with an important starting point in their presentday struggle to overcome the tyranny of the ayatollahs much like the situation that we currently see in iran before the revolution in 1906 iran was ruled harshly by leaders who did not have to respond to the will of the people as the people of iran watched their leaders squander away their nations land and resources they were emboldened by the democratic revolutions that were at that time sweeping through europe and latin american the people of iran saw what was happening in other countries and demanded similar reforms just as todays iranians see their needs overlooked in their leaders attempts to hasten the coming of a worldwide radical islamic state the destruction of the assets of iran before the 1906 revolution resulteq in widespread poverty food shortages and plague though the rulets demonstrated no obligation to relibve the needs of the people after years of agitation and a number of failed attempts to bring about representative constitutional reforms in cooperation with irans rulers the reformists chose nonviolent means to establish their demands early in 1906 some 16 000 iranians gathered in the mosques and the public places of tehran organized camps commissaries and sanitation facilities and established order and they simply stayed there in modern terms it was a giant sitin that lasted for weeks and on august 5 1906 mozafareddin shah signed a decree authorizing the creation of a freely elected majles which was the first task of writing a permanent constitution the constitution that was created was a modern representative document created upon the model of the belgian constitution that met all the requirements of the four demands of the revolutionary democratic movement the establishment of an independent judiciary was one the second was establishment of an independent legislature with members directly elected by the people the third was a sociopolitical progress including the separation of religion from the affairs of government i will repeat the separation of religion the fourth was a commitment of the government to the territorial integrity of iran and in 1907 in one of the most unfortunate events of the iranian history mozafareddin shah died and with him died the full implementation of the representative constitution nevertheless the 1906 constitution has always served as a beacon of liberty for those striving for freedom in iran all people on the face of the earth ought to have the right to live under a constitutionally prescribed government that is representative and responsive to the will of the people the 1906 constitution of iran provides the people of iran with a blueprint for constitutional government that is a product of their culture and their needs it has demonstrated that iranians could come together using their own resources and their own traditions to create a liberal representative constitutional state and even though a corrupt dictatorial reactionary regime has ruled in iran since 1979 the 1906 iranian constitution inspires hope for a free iran today i hope the recognition contained in this bill can help inspire iranians to rise up and expel their countrys dictators given the current threat the iranian regime poses to global security today the whole world should join in supporting and encouraging the iranian peoples fight for

dog democrats where were the democrats in the 30something group who say they would do a better job of taming the deficit when it came time to make the tough choices their votes did not match their rhetoric on the deficit in fact when it comes to offering solutions attacks and hollow rhetoric are all we hear from the other side what we do not hear from the other side is a plan of action what we dont hear from the other side is a set of principles what we do not hear from the other side is a strategy for securing our nation while expanding our economy these are truths and sometimes the truth does hurt republicans in contrast have a plan for leading this nation the republican study committee today released its proposal for balancing our budget a recommitment to the contract on america that budget recognizes that we must take serious steps to tame our budget deficit if the democrats had a plan which they do not their plan would include hefty tax hikes on american families and american

have never had more revenue but we still have to make tough choices in a world of tough choices we can raise the price of the buffet or we can curb our appetites with our waistlines bulging the choice is clear we must go on a spending diet until our pants fit again we have a plan for trimming down the budget we have a plan for continuing our economic growth we have a plan for strengthening the
