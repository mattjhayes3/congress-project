accept it my district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that

the bill that was given to us had the impression that it had a ban in i had an amendment that would have restricted the funds even more broadly than that but that is not in order how we can debate about our armed forces and whether we need to rebuild and restructure our armed forces and not debate the one thing that is depleting that is unifying jimmy carter and his great editorial today in the new york times saying civilians are victims of our flawed approach and henry kissinger and an increasing majority of americans realizing that we are burning up in a futile effort in an effort over

that is a large number that is documented we do not know what are the other numbers the reason why i wanted to have this discussion on the floor of the house is because i have encountered a number of custodians of children those who have custodial care whether they are grandparents or aunts and uncles single parents and families who are suffering alone with children who need mental health care but one of the major problems is as we all know the work of children is going to school we get up every morning and we head out for our work as an adult i am told that that work for children is when they
