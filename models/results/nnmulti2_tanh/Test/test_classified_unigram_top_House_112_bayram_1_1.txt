however will cost the economy more than 1 billion each at the current pace the current regulatory burden for 2011 alone will exceed 105 billion and the federal government has created more than 81 9 million hours worth of paperwork this year alone costing employers 80 billion just in compliance its no wonder a recent gallup poll found small business owners citing complying with government regulations as the most important problem they face nebraskans have not been immune to the reams of red tape being handed down by federal regulators just yesterday it was reported the city of grand island nebraska population 51 000 will be saddled with a 3 2 million compliance cost due to a new federal emissions regulation this epa crossstate air pollution rule was finalized june 1 and will be enforced but this is only one example there are additional even more costly rules and unworkable timelines coming down the pike all of which mean a much longer winter for americans struggling with high energy costs but it doesnt stop there recently the department of labor proposed a misguided rule which would restrict youth involvement in agriculture work yes anything from milking cows and feeding calves to hauling and detassling corn would come under fire under the departments current rule everyone agrees the safety of these young people and workers everywhere is of the utmost importance but by allowing such heavyhanded thoughtless regulation were greatly restricting opportunities for rural youth these jobs often seasonal teach young people responsibility and the value of hard work and theyre able to earn a little spending money in the process im also a proud cosponsor of the farm dust regulation prevention act of 2011 h r 1633 which the house is slated to consider later this week this bill would prevent the epa from regulating farm dust or the type of dust which naturally occurs in rural areas farmers and ranchers already are subject to strict federal and state regulations to control dust it makes no sense for the epa to impose costlier requirements on top of the existing standards while the epa has backed off without legislative action nothing certainly prohibits the agency from regulating farm dust in the future during a time of economic hardship keeping the door open for additional regulatory overreach is not the answer actually im often reminded of a meeting i had in southeastern nebraska with representatives from a federal agency good people they are one of them said it had been more than 20 years since hed ridden on a gravel road for me this meeting certainly emphasized the disconnect between washington and rural america these are only a few examples of the regulatory burden and uncertainty facing nebraskans who recognize economic

bill to pass this congress and as youve heard from my colleagues we need to begin with the american jobs act which was proposed by our president barack obama and just to be clear while were advocates for the african american community we are advocates for everyone and this bill is good for everyone everyone who lives in this country and it is a good bill for our country we happen to feel that putting people back to work in this country now is more important than fighting over an election that is more than a year away the american jobs act provides tax cuts that will help businesses grow and create jobs it will help provide incentives to hire the longterm unemployed and it will keep teachers and other essential workers like police and firefighters in their jobs where we need them to be and it will strengthen repair and build needed and faulty infrastructure and in doing so will create even more jobs and it will give people a decent job which will allow them to take care of their families to buy what we make here in america and it will stimulate economic growth it would give every american worker and their family a tax cut through extending the tax payroll tax holiday and do more to fix the mortgage crisis that got us here in the first place by allowing more refinancing of mortgages it would help our fellow americans take better care of their families putting their children in better schools supporting small businesses building consumer confidence and spurring the spending that our economy needs to get back on track this is what this congress ought to be doing not focusing on the solitary goal of making president obama a oneterm president that is a losing proposition anyway no one should be willing to let our fellow americans suffer fall into and become mired in poverty remain unemployed lose homes and to cause our economy to crumble further just because they have political and whatever other differences with our president the republican leadership led by the tea party extremists are taking this country in the absolute wrong direction by insisting on cutting and cutting and cutting important programs and services like the women infants and children program maternal and child health and supplemental nutrition assistance programs at a time when there are more people and more children in poverty by working to deny the opportunity for health care to the over 30 million people who we worked so hard to get insured including sick children and people who would otherwise go bankrupt because of catastrophic illnesses over which they had no control people who are already getting care because of the affordable care act that is being so wrongly maligned i agree with some of the posters i saw in the newspaper this weekend calling for jobs not cuts jobs not cuts that is what we have been saying all year including here on the floor of the house every monday that weve been in session if our leadership listened instead of talk talk talk i believe that is what they will hear the american people at large are saying jobs not cuts and we have a golden opportunity to listen to them for over the last 2 weeks there has been an occupation of wall street because while homeowners and pensioners and many people have suffered because of their meltdown we have not seen the kind of remedies for the folks on main street the side streets or the rural roads that would make them whole they are speaking loudly and effectively on their and on our behalf and then right here in washington d c today and for the next 3 days the take back the american dream conference is here they will be on the hill on wednesday calling on us to end the nightmare that the dream is turning into for far too many people and to restore the american dream access which has been the hallmark and the pride of this country what is happening at this conference and the one in new york is that americans are saying enough is enough and they are fighting back against the cuts that are making it hard for far too many people in this country to survive theyre fighting back against attempts to repeal health care reform fighting back against proposals that would weaken social security medicare and medicaid and fighting back against voter suppression laws theyre fighting for jobs for a future for our children and theyre fighting for our democracy it is so very interesting this talk about president obama and democrats waging class warfare all because we want everyone in this country to do their part to help this country recover from a deep recession all because we want to let tax cuts that were only supposed to be around for 10 years that have now been extended to 12 years finally expire like they were supposed to come on colleagues lets be honest they were never meant to be permanent and how many jobs have these tax cuts created as was loudly touted they would do in 2001 at the end of the clinton administration he handed over this government with an over 2 trillion surplus now after those tax cuts enacted in 2001 after almost 12 years of them we are in record deficits and the worst recession since the great depression and president obama did not create that he inherited it the poverty rate is at the second highest in 45 years and it is hitting as youve heard african americans and latino americans hardest the share of americans in deep poverty with incomes below half of the poverty line is at the highest level ever recorded and african americans are more likely to be in extreme poverty while we hear a lot about how much of a share of taxes the richest 1 percent or the richest 10 percent pay let me remind everyone that white americans wealth is 20 timesand you heard it earlier but it bears repeating20 times that of african americans and 18 times that of latinos and that between 2000 and 2007 not 10 percent not 20 percent not 40 percent but 100 percent all of the increase in wealth went to the top 10 percent in this countryall the top 10 percent the gap between rich and poor got wider the rich got richer the poor got poorer thats a very dangerous trend for the future of this country and then unemployment has reached record highs as well you dont hear about it much you hear it from us but in far too many places our rural and our urban areas communities of color unemployment remains in double digits african american unemployment nationally is over 16 percent but as youve heard we know that it is higher than that in many parts of our country so if we want to talk honestly about class warfare class warfare is what too many people in this country have been experiencing since 2001 and now that we have a president who wants to end it he is being accused of class warfare if we really want to end class warfare my colleagues my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should be supporting rather than opposing him lets get real in all of our 40 years the congressional black caucus has always been a caucus of action our agenda has been consistent and weve pushed every congress and every president and so we resent anyone trying to put a wedge between us and our president to further their own agenda one which is clearly not ours but we continue to be the conscience of the congress as maxine waters coined when she was chair the fairness cops of our nation that is why when we could see none of our 40 jobcreating bills come to the floor under the leadership of our chairman emanuel cleaver and the jobs task force chair and former cbc chair maxine waters we called on the private sector as well as government agencies to come with us across the country to get people working again and that is why we worked so hard with our hispanic and asian colleagues to get the affordable care act passed and we will work just as hard to see that it gets implemented we are not going to sit quietly and let a vital door that is just opening for many to be slammed shut in our communities and communities like ours who need it most many scholarly reports have shown that just eliminating health disparities could save 1 24 trillion in just over 4 years in indirect and direct costs in addition to saving lives so if we really wanted a deficit reduction eliminating health disparities and achieving health equity is deficit reduction at its best and thats why we will continue to work relentlessly as a caucus to save homes to build and equip better schools to support regulations that protect our families and all families from the health and other effects of pollution we have also worked together on budgets and because we know that our country can invest where needed in health care education green energy and job creation and reduce the deficit at the same time we are preparing to send our recommendation to the joint select committee on deficit reduction it will likely be based on our proposed 2012 budget and it will end class warfare by allowing the highend bush tax cuts to expire while strengthening the middle class continuing to create pathways out of poverty for our fellow americans and protecting social security medicare and medicaid this country is fortunate to have

talking about the real issue here you know the cotton program isnt perfect a lot of the programs that we have in the agriculture committee arent perfect freedom to farm it was passed in 96 it got us into some of these problems i opposed it saved a little bit of money and then we ended up spending 10 times as much money bailing people out when it collapsed so you have got to be careful what you are doing but the problem here is were arguing about something that no longer exists this program that they sued us under no longer exists we have fixed it two or three times we tried to address this it was never good enough for the brazilians but we made some changes and we made some more changes and then we made some more changes in the 2008 farm bill its still not good enough for them cotton went through some very difficult times i dont have any cotton in my district this is not a parochial issue for me but if they wouldnt have had that safety net we would have been out of the cotton business but what was going on at the same time we had brazil using government money to increase cotton production in brazil and this is something that isnt considered in the wto because we are such geniuses that we agreed to this agreement that tied our hands and gave our competitors the ability to eat our lunch and thats whats going on you know jbs which just took over a big part of the livestock industry in this country is financed by the brazilian government they own 30 percent of jbs nobody complains about that the brazilian government created most of this competition that collapsed the cotton prices worldwide and then we agreed to let china into the wto and they promised that they werent going to go into cotton production we shipped our textile market to china and collapsed all of our textile industry and what happened they increased production like crazy india increased production like crazy our cotton prices went down below the cost of production because of these trade agreements that we got involved in but the way theyre structured theres nothing we can do about it but theyre going to sue us over a little step two program that we now got rid of trying to keep our people in business now if you want to ship the whole cotton industry to brazil and china and india you are on a good start to doing that and if you keep on this road youre going to ship the rest of agriculture to these socalled developing nations that are not developing nations if youve been to brazil in agriculture they are anything but a developing nation but theyre protected under the rules that we agreed to in this wto deal so is this a perfect solution no but we couldnt get the brazilians to honestly sit down and work this out because they dont want to theyre trying to use this for other reasons for other advantages in these trade negotiations and so forth and i dont think we can ever do anything to satisfy them so theres more to this than people are talking about here this is not about saving money this is about making sure that we can have a safety net in this country so we can maintain production of agriculture in the united states and not ship it all to other countries and not get dependent on foreign countries for our food like weve become dependent on foreign countries for our energy that would be the worst thing that could happen to us so i just hope people understand all of the different ramifications this isnt a perfect deal but for the time being its probably the best solution that we can come up with i yield back the balance of my time"],

from cyprus so that the island can move forward as one nation turkey continues to forcibly occupy more than onethird of cyprus with more than 48 000 troops in addition to date turkey has repeatedly ignored many of the united nations resolutions pertaining to cyprus and has continued to occupy the island in complete violation of international law the destruction of religious and cultural sites

and to exploit its energy resources without illegal interference by turkey in 2011 they discovered gas in the cypriot area the noble energy company a private energy company from texas discovered that a field off the coast of cyprus may hold as much as 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas the first discovery off the divided island nation this is tremendously important for energy independence and

capitol hill endured a 6 percent cut just this year it seems only fair that in the midst of our current economic crisis we should ask federal commissions without any extreme need or urgent purposes to bear the same reductions i believe that the marine mammal commission falls under this criteria and that it should be able to find 6 percent worth of savings if they comb through every corner of their budget we reduced our budget in our offices by much more than this i think the marine mammal commission can trim their budget by just 6 percent and i urge my colleagues to support this very simple amendment that would save nearly 200 000 i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.00914376974105835, 0.49085623025894165, 1, "i rise to recognize and celebrate the life of ed jenkins a fellow
