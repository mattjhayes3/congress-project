that just a few days ago i offered this amendment dealing with museums and dealing with my concern for the funding and the smithsonian to provide for the nations museum let me also say to my colleagues that i have offered this amendment in the past because i have a particular interest in the museums of america and their ability to do outreach i imagine i am not alone standing here amongst appropriators to again say and call for the end of sequestration to be able to provide the appropriators and to provide the people of america the full funding to address these quality of life issues from the various lands and federal parks and as well the historic trails of which i will talk about but museums urban reforestation all elements of the beauty of this nation and i frankly believe that museums likewise are that form of beauty my amendment specifically says none of the funds made available in this act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the smithsonian institution in order to fulfill the smithsonians mission the increase and diffusion of knowledge the smithsonian seeks to serve an even greater audience by bringing the smithsonian to enclaves of communities who otherwise would be deprived of the vast amounts of cultural history offered by the smithsonian our museums of the nation are in trouble the smithsonian has a beautiful array of museums that are here that millions of americans have the opportunity to visit but the outreach program serves millions of americans thousands of communities and hundreds of institutions in all 50 states through loans of objects traveling exhibitions and sharing of educational resources via publications lectures and presentations training programs and web sites allow me to mention just a few in my own district the holocaust museum unique in its presentation of a horrible time in history but it also serves as a very unifying entity in our community the childrens museum as one of the original board members and founders now the childrens museum is one of the major childrens museums in the nation but again it needs the impact of the outreach of the smithsonian and then of course the museum of african american culture headed by a dear friend but also a champion of holding this museum together and that is john guess he needs a fuller embrace by the smithsonian including its expertise its experts its ph d s traveling efforts and again its encouragement of corporate communities to recognize the value of participating in museums the smithsonians outreach activities include the smithsonian institution traveling exhibition the smithsonian center for education and museum studies national science resources center the smithsonian institution press the office of fellowships and the smithsonian associates who are we if we do not value preserving those items that tell the varied and diverse history of america the good history of america the history that is unifying and purposeful in citing us as a country that recognizes our wonderful diversity so i ask my colleagues to support this amendment that deals specifically with allowing the outreach to the kinds of museums that really need the help of the smithsonian the smithsonian in concluding is very important to urban areas and rural areas alike and its ability or its affiliation is to build a strong national network of museums and educational organizations in order to establish active and engaging relationships with communities throughout the country again allow me to salute in particular john guess with the museum of african american culture in houston he has literally put that museum together along with his board members the smithsoniani hope they are hearing me as i am talking on the floor of the housewe need your help in houston texas we probably need your help in washington state in california minnesota new york and beyond to preserve and help these small museums throughout the nation i ask my colleagues to support not only this amendment but the museums of this nation and i say to mr calvert we had discussed this before this amendment now is a placeholder hopefully for our discussion going forward dealing with the preservation of our museums let me thank mr calvert mr simpson and ms mccollum i yield back the balance of my time mr chair thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my amendment to h r 2822 the interior and environment appropriations act of 2016 let me also thank chairman calvert and ranking member mccollum for their leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor

indian and the national portrait gallery the smithsonian also operates another national treasure the national zoo mr chair my amendment is simple but it sends a very important message from the congress of the united states the jackson lee amendment simply provides that sec none of the funds made available in this act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the smithsonian institution this amendment is identical to an amendment i offered to the interior and environment appropriations act for fy2008 that was approved by voice vote on june 26 mr chair the smithsonians

life family quilts prairie schoolhouse furnishings historical lunch boxes multilingual store front and street signs etc has been a longstanding organizational priority of the smithsonian sites mobile museum is the only traveling exhibit format able to guarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during sustained periods of economic retrenchment but also because it is imperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling financially yet eager to participate in smithsonian outreach for communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic downturn the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions the mobile museum promises to answer an evergrowing demand for smithsonian shows in the field a single conventional sites exhibit can reach a maximum of 12 locations over a twoto threeyear period in contrast a mobile museum exhibit can visit up to three venues per week in the course of only one year at no cost to the host institution or community the net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach locations to which sites shows can travel annually and in addition to its flexibility in making shortterm stops in cities and towns from coasttocoast a mobile museum has the advantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people live work and take part in leisure time activities by establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these sites will not only increase its annual visitor participation by 1 million but also advance a key smithsonian performance objective to develop exhibit approaches that address diverse audiences including population groups not always affiliated with mainstream cultural institutions sites also will be the public exhibitions face of the smithsonians national museum of

peerreviewed scientific studies that say the opposite climate change often brings images to mind of melting icecaps and rising sea levels but the effects of climate change are being felt every day by people around the country climate change is causing even more destructive storms which when combined with our aging infrastructure is resulting in cities around the country being pummeled by urban flooding a little more than 2 years ago residents in my district endured their second 100year flood in a mere 3 years a 100year storm means that there is a 1 percent chance that a storm of that magnitude will happen every year but folks in chicago are experiencing these storms with greater intensity and frequency the morning after the rains bombarded chicago in 2013 i visited numerous community members and their homes the damage i saw was devastating thousands of homes and businesses flooded tons of carpeting furniture and memories are ruined businesses shattered and entrepreneurs dreams crushed along with millions of dollars in damages throughout the region we saw the closure of schools libraries and even hospitals were forced to relocate patients that kind of devastation cannot be ignored our constituents cannot be ignored in chicago over the past century we have seen countless storms that have caused pipes to back up into houses and dump upwards of 1 5 inches of rain in a single day what is more rains of more than 2 5 inches a day are expected to increase another 50 percent in the next 20 years the national climate assessment released by the obama administration last year predicted that the frequency and intensity of the midwests heaviest downpours will more than double over the next 100 years that means even more trouble for our nations already deteriorating infrastructure and the cities around the country that rely on that infrastructure to keep them safe storm drains are outdated sewers are inadequate and families are at risk whether it is because of flooded pipes or the lack of permeable surfaces in our cities our constituents are paying the prices thousands of households in america are affected every year by urban flooding yielding catastrophic

chronically damp houses can cause respiratory problems and higher insurance costs additionally almost two out of five small businesses cannot open after experiencing a flooding disaster urban flooding erodes streams and riverbeds and degrades the quality of our drinking water sources and the health of our aquatic ecosystems it is time we come up with a national response to this growing problem that is why i am proud to introduce the urban flooding awareness act this legislation will finally create a definition of urban flooding to be used when designing flood maps and will require a first ofit skind study to analyze the costs associated with urban flooding and develop solutions it would also help us better protect downstream communities from the flooding impacts of development in upstream areas existing regulatory and policy mechanisms are not adequate for this task it is time we develop new strategies by identifying the most effective and economical remedies to urban flooding we are better preparing our communities to defend themselves against the devastation caused by increasingly intense weather and investing in real solutions to this problem now is the only way to avoid higher costs down the road we can learn from our successes and investigate innovative new strategies for funding crucial new programs that eliminate flood risk and damage our cities need the best tools

particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health

diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all

states in 1996 after the worst mass shooting in australian history thenprime minister john howard led the battle for what was to become the national firearms agreement which banned certain semiautomatic and selfloading rifles and shotguns and required all firearm license applicants to show a genuine reason for owning a gun which couldnt include selfdefense the country instituted a mandatory federally financed gun buyback program which led to the repurchase of 700 000 guns which halved the number of gunowning households and reduced the number of guns in circulation by about 20

declarations of equality for all what kind of mind finds the basis to declare other individuals or groups defective or inferior what kind of mind declares other individuals unworthy or unqualified to share the protections of our constitution what kind of mind asserts they are above judgment by a member of another group what kind of mind envisions a world where one people are superior to another

more than 30 000 of our nations citizens each year a number that far exceeds other industrial countries now all these countries have their share of violent extremists and madmen but only our country gives easy access to weapons of mass killing and that makes all the difference for america rather than seeking out commonsense solutions to address this crisis the republican majority continues to cower to the gun lobby and the firearms manufacturers now they plead the second amendment but constitutional law 101 would tell us that all of our rights including the precious freedoms of religion and speech must be balanced to protect innocent third parties and to protect the safety of the wider community one commonsense measure we should all agree on is background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill you cant shout fire in a crowded theater because of your freedom of speech and neither should you be able to buy a weapon if you have a history of violence and criminality in fact almost 90 percent of americans including the majority of gun owners support universal background checks for all gun purchases the problem is that our present background check system is rife with loopholes background checks are not required for private sales at gun shows they are also not required for internet sales bipartisan legislation has been introduced by representatives peter king and mike thompson that would finally close this egregious loophole it is an entirely sensible reform that would have a measurable impact on the safety of our schools homes and neighborhoods without preventing lawabiding citizens from using guns for selfdefense or recreational purposes despite attracting 186 cosponsors including several republicans the

legislation they claim would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms after all nearly 2 500 individuals on the terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in this country but rather than embrace existing bipartisan legislation to actually fix the problem republicans put forth a woefully inadequate proposal that would require law enforcement and courts to grapple with unworkable processes unreachable standards to be completed in an unreasonably short period of time their bill would allow suspected terrorists to receive firearms by default after only 3 days if the court is unable to work through a complicated process that is the same flaw that allowed the white supremacist charleston shooter to obtain the weapon that he used to murder nine people at emanuel ame church in other words the bill is totally inadequate now under pressure from their most extreme members republican leaders refuse to even put this bill on the floor what should be on the floor is bipartisan legislation h r 1076 that would permit the attorney general to block gun sales to suspected terrorists this legislation based on a proposal from the bush justice department would still allow individuals to challenge the government in court to restore their gun ownership rights we dont have to choose between protecting our communities and respecting due process and so we ask our

summer is a big time for any industry that depends on tourism to survive i offer this amendment out of concern for two lake communities in my district just last year during the height of the summers busy tourist season the united states fish and wildlife service required that the northern indiana public service company locally known as nipsco release more water into the tippecanoe river from lake freeman to protect a bed of endangered freshwater mussels that live further down the tippecanoe river all under the guise of the endangered species act as a result in a matter of days water levels on lake freeman dropped dramatically i have visited with local residents near lake freeman multiple times and have seen the lake in person growing up during the summers i spent my time on the sister lake lake shafer many who live and work near the lake discovered to their surprise their boats were stuck businesses were in jeopardy and home values were going down but more than that stumps were rising out of the water and personal health and safety were also in jeopardy as a result now i immediately contacted fish and wildlife and i want to applaud them for their responsiveness and nipsco for working together we created a technical assistance letter otherwise known as a tal it is my estimation that that is going to have some effect again i appreciate the reasonableness of all involved the current plan there is a temporary fix and really we ought to be able to do more now currently fish and wildlife receives funding to enforce the endangered species act which protects six species of mussels that live in the river as the clerk mentioned as he read the amendment the endangered species act gives the highest priority to protected and listed species and there is little anyone can do in terms of exceptions or exemptions or even any kind of balancing test to make sure that there is not a solution that could be a winwin it is a very draconian lawstrict compliance no balancing test no room for discretion or creative solution that is where this reform is needed the statute like i said provides no balancing test for weighing the economic harms and the supreme court of this land has refused to allow us or even lower courts to construct their own test us as citizens compliance with this law as currently written requires diverting water from lake freeman to the tippecanoe river to balance water levels despite consideration of the economic impact and human safety in essence my amendment limits the funding mechanism fish and wildlife would be able to use to enforce the endangered species act with respect to these six types of mussels and eliminates the financial repercussions for failing to enforce the law speaking firsthand with residents lowering these water levels in lake freeman negatively affects the community and small businesses that rely on the tourists who enjoy the lake and the steady water level lower water levels also pose dangerous swimming conditions to both boaters and swimmers as formerly underwater tree stumps breach the water this is unnecessary and a preventable hazard to those who use the lake and again in a winwin way it is all because of this draconian law that although well intended is badly in need of reform so that its practical effect can be overhauled and any of its misguided applications halted hoosiers like myself are just as concerned for the environment as they are for their incomes and family recreation it is not about antienvironmentalism but they believe like i said there is a winwin solution here if only the law would allow such a solution to exist in the meantime we ought to defund fish and wildlifes ability to enforce this law as it is written while i value nature and seek to protect endangered animals the reward of protecting the mussel does not outweigh the economic damage done to this community or the personal safety or health of my human constituents"], [0.9999871253967285,

establishing a new requirement in clause 8 of rule xiii that the congressional budget office cbo and the joint committee on taxation jct incorporate into the official cost estimates required under section 402 of the congressional budget act of 1974 budget act the macroeconomic effects of major legislation because this rule builds on the existing requirement for cost estimates it does not apply to appropriations legislation by including an analysis of how major legislation will affect the economy this rule provides the house with a more comprehensive estimate than can be produced using only the traditional conventional scoring methods which implicitly assume that legislation has no effect on the broader economy in particular this analysis is required to include the budgetary effects of changes in economic output employment the capital stock and other macroeconomic variables resulting from major legislation in addition this rule requires a qualitative assessment of the longterm budgetary and macroeconomic effects of major legislation major legislation is defined as legislation causing an increase or decrease in revenues outlays or deficits in any fiscal year covered by the budget resolution equal to or greater than 0 25 percent of the projected gross domestic product for that year in applying the 0 25 percent threshold cbo and jct are required to look at the gross budgetary effects of the legislation in carrying out this requirement the intent is that cbo and jct review provisions in the bill that have a significant effect thus the test is whether any provision in the legislation has a budgetary effect larger than the threshold or if the absolute value of the sum of the provisions exceeds the threshold rather than whether the legislation as a whole has such an effect when all of the provisions are netted out alternately for legislation that may not have a large fiscal effect but would still have significant economic impacts the new rule empowers the house to designate major legislation for all legislation other than purely revenue legislation the rule authorizes the chair of the budget committee to designate major legislation for purely revenue legislation i e legislation that contains only provisions described in section 201 f of the budget act the rule authorizes the house member serving as the chair or vice chair of jct to designate major legislation for purposes of this rule the rule carefully preserves the existing division of labor between cbo and jct which requires close collaboration between these two nonpartisan institutions when major legislation involves both revenue and nonrevenue provisions cbo and jct will need to work together to produce a single integrated cost estimate for the legislation drawing on each agencys institutional responsibilities the rule requires enhanced transparency around these budgetary estimates both cbo and jct as applicable must provide together with their estimates a description of the critical assumptions and the source data underlying such estimates it is important that cbo and jct make this information available so that the public academic and other experts have an opportunity to review the analysis and pursue possible improvements in the methodologies used to develop these estimates distributional analyses of proposed tax changes that jct provides as background information is another area where estimates could be improved by incorporating macroeconomic effects into these analyses the preparation of cost estimates incorporating macroeconomic effects is frequently more complex and requires more time than the preparation of conventional cost estimates committees should therefore build in additional time to allow for the completion of the cost estimate both cbo and jct should strive to promptly produce the estimates required by this rule to the extent it is not practicable for cbo and jct to produce the required estimates the rule provides an accommodation in this instance two possible circumstances may arise when it is not feasible to produce the required analysis first committees and the house may be operating under tight deadlines and it is not possible for cbo or jct to complete the analysis prior to the legislations consideration second while cbo and jct have developed a great deal of expertise and experience in producing these analyses there may

have got a few that are bad apples we have got to give the tools necessary to the leadership within the administration to do what is right and if necessary allow them latitude to let those people go we voted on a similar bill years ago before i got into congress we gave this right and authority we gave it to the irs guess what the irs has the best tax compliance in all federal governmentwho would have thought i was pleased to see that congressman steny hoyer voted for that piece of legislation that congressman elijah cummings voted for that legislation we want to take that same power that same right that we gave the irs years ago because it workedit workedand we want to give that to the other departments and agencies now there are a lot of exceptions there are a lot of ways to get out of this but the basic principle is true one federal workers do a better job of paying their taxes than the general public and we should pat them on the back and we should recognize them for that but two when you do have a few bad apples you have got to allow leadership the ability to let those people go if they continue to thumb their nose at the system and the taxpayers we just heard testimony from the dea i cant fire anybody even though they were engaged in some very nefarious activity we heard the administrator of the epa say i cant let anybody go even though the person is watching 4 hours of porn a day four hours a day they couldnt fire them lets give them some latitude because we have a test case it has worked we want tax compliance the presidents fiscal year 2016 budget asks american taxpayers to spend 275 billion to pay federal workers an average salary of more than 78 000 yet the irs reports that more than 100 000 federal civilian employees owed more than 1 billion in unpaid federal income taxes in 2014more than 1 billion now there are lots of reasons people cant do that there are people who need to have their wages garnished and they are there are people who are disputing what the irs said again this bill doesnt affect those people the adjudication process continues on and this bill doesnt affect those people as a last resort we need a tool that the irs has for its employees we need that tool for the other departments and agencies because like it or not the law requires that we pay taxes five years ago president obama directed his administration to crack down on tax cheats it was specifically targeting and discussing contractors but i would argue that the same principle for contractors should be in place for federal employees how can you look the contractors and the employees in the eyes and say well we have got two totally different standards of principles the principle is the samepay your taxes and there is not a problem if you are in trouble and if you are trying to get out of it not a problem we will work with you yet for those of you who are just screwing over the american taxpayer byebye you cant even apply the president said all across this country there are people who meet their obligations each and every day you do your jobs you support your families you pay the taxes you owebecause its a fundamental responsibility of citizenship i totally and wholeheartedly agree the federal employee tax accountability act makes individuals with seriously delinquent tax debt ineligible for federal employment it is defined as an outstanding federal tax debt that has been assessed and may be collected by levy or court proceeding the legislation does not affect employees who are working to settle their tax disputes or resolving outstanding liabilities i want to also remind everybody that the committee and i as the prime sponsor accepted every democrat amendment that was offered100 percent several other safeguards are carved out in the bill including provisions offered by the minority in the previous congresses individuals are provided full due process rights and have an additional 180 days to demonstrate their debts meet one of the exemptions of the bill that was i believe offered by congressman lynch we accepted it we thought we would get broader support because of it and we would hope we would today the bill also provides a financial hardship exemption if the individuals service is in the best interest of the united states the person who is leading that department or agency still has discretion if he says it is in the best interest in my judgment for the united states to continue to have this person serve he is allowed to continue to serve the bill demonstrates a simple principle individuals collecting federal salaries funded by taxpayers have to follow the rules and pay their taxes those charged with the stewardship of our federal resources and programs should not be delinquent in their taxes as all americans file their taxes today so should federal employees and most of them doin fact at better rates than civilians do last month in testimony before the committee the gao warned congress of tens of thousands of federal employees who were eligible for security clearances but who still had unpaid tax debts i would argue that that is a potential security risk it shows a vulnerability during

of dna evidence this evidence does us no good if it remains untested and sitting on a shelf in a lab somewhere despite progress over the last few years and much progress most recently there are still thousands of rape kits that remain untestedpotentially hundreds of thousands that is potentially hundreds of thousands of victims whose assailants are never brought to justice left to prey on yet more women last year my hometown paper the memphis commercial appeal highlighted the tragic need to end this backlog once and for all it described a serial rapist who was finally caught by police in 2012 he could have been stopped nearly a decade earlier if only his first victims rape kit had been tested but that kit wasnt and instead he was able to attack five more women over the next 8 years missed opportunities like this happen all across our country every day the trauma inflicted on victims of rape can be compounded when they know that their assailants run free while critical evidence goes untested fortunately efforts are underway to reduce the backlog and they are making a difference in memphis our backlog reached more than 12 000 but police have now opened 488 investigations and issued 90 requests for indictment but testing rape kits cost money more than local law enforcement can afford i appreciate the chairmans and the ranking members commitment to eliminating the backlog and the funding that the committee has provided in the bill but we need more this amendment would increase by not quite 10 percent an additional 4 million and would take it from the drug enforcement administration a 2 billion agency that receives a 40 million increase in this bill dea would barely notice the difference moreover dea has been alarmingly irresponsible with money congress has given it previously an inspector general report recently found that dea agents had sex parties with prostitutes funded by drug cartels in governmentleased living quarters and this followed an inspector general report that found the dea paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for information from amtrak that they could have obtained for free i think the choice is clear we should stand with victims of sexual assault i urge my colleagues to pass this amendment it is so important that these kits are tested that the assailants are brought to justice and that additional women are not attacked by what are known to be serial rapists who are out on the streets i would like to say a thank you to my partner on this amendment representative carolyn maloney who has been a tireless advocate on this issue as well i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
