share some information with the members is the fact that what ms wasserman schultz has just gone through is not only factual it wasnt written by the democratic minority it wasnt written by some person over at the democratic national committee this is from the 9 11 commission and they just recently released it a bipartisan commission number two it is almost not fair for us to share this information not only with the members but with others because it is so accurate and ft is unfortunate that it is accurate at no other time in the history of this country have we found ourselves in this posture u 2115 now members can come to the floor and start talking about what we are going to do with other countries we owe other countries money we are borrowing from other countries like we have never borrowed before in the history of the republic and that is the reason why we feel encouraged to come to the floor night after night day after day week after week month after month year after year and put it on printed paper in the congressional record so when historians look at this time and wonder where was the unitedstates congress when all this was happening i believe that historians are going to look back on this time and say the american people rose up democrats republicans independents those that could not vote that made themselves eligible to vote to stop this from happening now ms wasserman schultz mentioned something about military preparedness and the fact that we cannot even respond to other issues that may happen in the world i am on the armed setvices committee and we come to the floor to conduct serious business this is not some sort of news show where someone asks you a question some sort of trick question and you try to respond within 3 minutes this is theunitedstates congress this is not a 501 c 3 i talked about that last night what we have here is a rubber stamp congress that is willing to rubber stamp anything that the president sends to capitol hill it is very unfortunate that this is the case and because of that we have ourselves in this situation under the leadership of the president and the secretary rumsfeld unitedstates military readiness has dropped to historic lows the unitedstates army readiness in particular has dropped to levels not seen since 1970 and will continue to be stressed by combat in iraq which falls most heavily on the army and marine corps twothirds of army operating force active and reserve is now reporting in as unready and there is not a single nondeployment of an army brigade combat team in the united states of america that is ready to be deployed what is the reference point here it is not the democratic national conmittee it is not even the democratic caucus it is the national security advisory group when august 1 of 2006 these are individuals that are supposed to be the watchdog of national security that is with what they are saying how did this happen mr speaker it didnt happen because the army and marines said hey we want to overextend ourselves and we want to put ourselves in a position to where every brigade has been deployed to iraq this is the situation that we are in when we go alone now let us just put iraq aside just for a second when you look at the testimony and those retired generals that are now free to say whatever they want to say since they are no longer in the department of defense and i must say for the record secretary rumsfeld just said recently the last couple of days anyone who comes to him about the issue of redeployment within the department of defense can go find another job in so many words was there a chairperson of a subcommittee in armed services or the appropriations committee as it relates to armed services the department of defense was there the chair of the full committee on appropriations in the unitedstates house was there a chair of the armed services committee that said wait a minute hold it i am sorry is this the same administration and the same secretary of defense that said we take our lead from the commanders in the field and from those experts that wear the uniform that have made a statement such as that if i was a fourstar general a threestar general or want to be a threestar general a twostar general or a brigadier general or a colonel that wants to one day become a colonel i think i may step back and say well one of two things either i am going to be quiet in the department of defense in this democracy that we call the united states of america or i am going to retire guess what these generals have retired and they are talking and they are talking about their frustration these heroes for our country are now taking it upon themselves because they allowed us to this point to salute one flag and they said they will give up their careers and they will step out of the department of defense to be able to let the american people know what is going on look at these generals look at them you would have some members of congress who say why are they speaking against the department of defense why arent they still in the fight well they are in a fight for democracy and the truth they are in a fight to make sure that the american people know exactly what is going on they are in a fight for the very reason why people have fought and died for this country to allow the american people to know better now let me just mention something very quickly because i want to make sure that all of the members know exactly what they need to know as it relates to the national security plan real security housedemocrats gov 30something you can go on there and get the real security plan energy independence folks talk about saudi arabia we the democratic caucus here in this house want to invest in the midwest versus the middle east we want to use our natural resources we want to use coal we want to use e85 which can be made out of corn and what have here in the united states of america energizing

we are going to be as it relates to broadband right here innovation agenda we have six points mr speaker in 2006 to make sure that american people know that we have the will and the desire to lead this country in a new direction versus the wrong direction this is not talk this is action there are bills right now filed in the 109th congress in this second session that will deal with the issue of

committee i rise today to speak on the economic policies of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.0009638071060180664, 0.9990361928939819, 1, "absolutely let

the nations debt is now over 8 trillion with a t and the interest in the 2007 presidents budget the interest alone is almost twohundredandtwentysome billion dollars out of this budget now when you look and you compare what we have to pay in interest on the debt compared to what we are paying for education or homeland security or veterans it is totally and utterly disproportionate to the kind of investments we need to be making because this money and on the chart here we are borrowing this money from the japanese government we are borrowing the money from the chinese government we are borrowing the money from opec countries we are ceding our country away to these other foreign interests and at the same time we are asking japan and cliina to borrow money because we do not have enough because we are giving out corporate subsidies to the oil companies and corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical companies while we are doing that we have to go and borrow the money from the chinese government and then we have to borrow it from the opec countries and as we showed before earlier an hour or so ago the chinese government is taking this money they are lending it to us collecting the interest and investing that money in the training of engineers to the tune of 600 000 engineers that they are going to train next year while we are training 70 that really is the bottom line that these kind of decisions are leading and costing they are leading to enormous problems for our country and they are costing us a lot of money they are really beginning i think to push the burden down on to the next generation we cannot continue to sustain the kind of deficits that we are running the next year or 2007 years budget deficit is projected at over 400 billion 400 billion and that is unacceptable while we are giving the oil industry 12 billion and 16 billion to the energy industry and we are giving to the tune of 50 60 70 billion to the health care industry in subsidies it is a coincidence or maybe it is not that the oil industrys profits are going through the roof so it begs the question why are we subsidizing them the energy companies profits going up subsidizing them too pharmaceutical companies profits through the roof subsidize them too this is paytoplay in washington d c and all the while it is happening at the expense of average people all this is happening at the cost of the american people there is a corruption tax there is a k street tax to average people who are trying to do business trying to make ends meet in middle america and all across the country

gentleman for yielding me this time and more importantly for his distinguished leadership on many issues concerning americas working families i know i speak for all our colleagues when i say it is a privilege to call the gentleman from new york colleague i also extend my thanks to the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on trade the gentleman from maryland for his very very substantive review of this cafta treaty it has been an enormous help to members and i thank him for his leadership as well i rise in strong opposition to the central american free trade agreement it is a small treaty economically but it has enormous implications for our country i oppose cafta because it is a step backward for workers in central america and a job killer here at home as a californian and there are many of us in the chamber this evening we all know full well the significance of our close ties to central america my own city of san francisco is blessed with large populations of central americans including those who sought sanctuary from el salvador and those fleeing decades of civil war in guatemala our fate is tied with our neighbors in the hemisphere president john f kennedy recognized this in 1961 when he announced the alliance for progress calling for vast multilateral programs to relieve the continents poverty and social inequities the alliance for progress included both economic cooperation and called for economic reforms as conditions of participation just as we call for stronger labor and environmental standards today as the reasonable condition for trade agreements i wish that the cafta bill we are debating tonight were an agreement that opened markets included basic labor standards and protected our environment this type of agreement would have lifted the economies of both the united states and central america it would have attracted support from a large number of democratic members who have long histories of supporting free and fair trade including recent trade agreements with australia singapore chile morocco jordan vietnam and cambodia unfortunately that is not the type of trade agreement before us tonight instead we are considering a trade agreement that protnotes a race to the bottom that hurts unitedstates workers that turns back the clock on basic internationally accepted worker protections and fails to protect the environment as a result the republican leadership is having a hard time convincing its own members to vote for this bill we have heard our colleague earlier the gentleman from ohio talking about twisting arms until they are broken into a thousand pieces the new york times today the gentleman referenced the new york times so i will too said that a white house official said that the last votes are likely to be won with the most expensive deals we should be able to pass good fair trade agreement treaties on their merits instead the administration is trying to persuade people with side bars side letters and side deals they have never worked in the past they are just a con and i hope that our colleagues will not fall for the con in their desperation to win votes the president and the republican leadership in the house have also proclaimed that cafta here tonight will promote unitedstates security and democracy in central america the truth is if we want to improve our national security and promote democracy there we should heed the words of pope paul vi who said if you want peace work for justice trade alone devoid of basic living and working standards has not and will not promote security nor will it lift developing nations out of poverty our national security will not be improved by exploiting workers in central america here at home this cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions i repeat here at home cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions we have lost 2 8 million manufacturing jobs since president bush took office cafta does not solve the jobs problem it only digs the hole deeper these downward pressures create a race to the bottom that needlessly threaten unitedstates jobs nothing in this agreement will help raise substandard wages in central america or help create a strong middle class that has the disposable income to buy unitedstates goods democrats understandthe need to help our central american neighbors reap the benefits of increased trade but the cost of this cafta are too high with too little to justify this agreements deficiencies we must have basic worker protections which ensure that our trading partners abide by the most fundamefntal standards of common decency and fairness the cafta we are debating today fails to promote these basic measures of decency and fairness and in fact takes a step backward from current law because it removes the requirement from these countries to abide by the workers rights standards of the international labor standards when it comes to the environment democrats believe that environmental principles must be a central part of the core trade agreement cafta will do absolutely nothing to improve environmental protection in central america and it will open up our own environmental laws to attack by foreign corporations my colleagues this cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if the environmental laws reduce the value of their investment or cut their profits i repeat cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if an environmental law reduces the value of their investment or cuts into their profits cafta places no value on the environmental health of the americas moreover the enforcement provisions of this cafta are virtually nonexistent it merely calls for cafta countries to enforce their own laws enforcement in these areas must be written in to cafta if they are to be effective they are not democrats believe that to keep america in the lead the nation must adopt a bold new and sustained commitment to technological innovation and educational excellence that commitment would ensure that our country remains competitive and vibrant against formidable international competition generating highquality jobs throughout the 21st century we are committed to addressing challenges of increasing competitive global market our economic future rests on our ability to innovate new products and to create new markets for those goods and services we insist that this administration revisit its flawed trade policy and work with democrats so that we can pass free trade agreements including a new improved cafta that will expand markets spur economic growth protect the environment and raise living standards in the united states and abroad that would allow us to move forward with our other priorities american families are facing serious challenges rising health care costs record gas prices climbing college costs and massive job layoffs they are worried about the direction of our country instead of addressing the serious issues that directly affect americas families and coming up with real solutions repgblicans have abused their power and focused on the wrong priorities pursuing an energy bill that does nothing to lower gas prices or a social security privatization plan that weakens the safety net for americas elderly sadly this trade agreement and the way it has been pursued by the administration has become yet another example of those misplaced priorities and missed opportunities again president kennedy said in 1961 that the united states and latin america are firm and ancient friends united by history and experience and by our determination to advance the values of american civilization we must support all economic integration which is a genuine step toward larger markets and greater competitive opportunity it was true then it is an inspiration now i urge my colleagues to send this cafta back to the drawing board the administration can negotiate a new cafta that will open new markets include basic labor standards and protect the environment such an agreement would attract strong bipartisan support this cafta does none of the above it does not protect the environment it does not grow the economy in our country it does not lift the living standard in central america and it does not have my support vote no on this cafta"], [0.0010029077529907227, 0.9989970922470093, 1, "i plan to yield to several of my colleagues mr scott from virginia is also going to speak and as soon as mr spratt the ranking member on the house budget committee comes out of an important hearing on the dubai ports issue he will be able to join us as well the 2007 budget takes america down a wrong and unsustainable path the decisions the president made in this budget favor the wealthy over the working class these decisions reward those who live off what th6 irs considers to be unearned income while making those who have to work long hours every day to support themselves and their families pay far more in taxes in fact i think you would have found bipartisan agreement if we could have worked out tax cuts that were more in the interest of the working class and those hardworking families but in fact when you combine the focug of the tax cuts on those who live primarily off unearned income and the spending cuts that purportedly are necessary to offset the cost of these tax cuts the majority of young people in this country will find it harder to go to college it will be harder for lowincome elderly to get the nutrition and health care they need and it will be much harder for our grandchildren to pay for the future needs that their generation will face the decisions made in the presidents 2007 budget like his budgets since 2002 define a nation a community if you will that is not the america that we know in fact his priorities are just the opposite of what makes america great we heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle they call it a socalled republican truth squad it boggles your mind but the fact is that the bush administration has raised spending while they have cut taxes you cant fight two wars on four tax cuts ladies and gentlemen the gentlewoman from north carolina suggested that the government never invests it only spends well what does she think is the purpose of the interstate highway system that enabled our economy to fulfill its potential during the eisenhower administration and subsequent administrations or the money that we have put into the public schools systems to empower our working class and that is what we are talking about investment that will give us sustainable benefits versus tax cuts that are immediately lost most of which seem to be invested overseas and cuts in the real safety net that can make america achieve its greatness the conscious choices made in this budget reflect the flawed policies of an administration that has taken this country down a terribly wrong path one that consists of waging an unnecessary and extraordinarily costly war delivering huge tax cuts to the very wealthiest of this nation and taking the federal debt to depths never before experienced while reducing services to working americans first the 2007 budget is heavily impacted by the consequences of a reckless foreign venture namely the war in iraq the presidents 2007 budget sets aside another 120 billion supplemental to cover the cost of waging this war in fiscal 2007 of course this is on top of a regular defense budget of over 450 billion and in fact we have now allotted over 400 billion when you look through fiscal 2007 primarily for this war in iraq and very little for the war in afghanistan that was referred to by our colleague from maryland the money that is requested in these iraq war supplementals is 40 billion more than we request for transportation 33 billion more than we request for education and training more than 40 billion more than we request for the care of our military veterans inbre than 90 billion more than we will set aside to protect our environment and natural resources and more than 80 billion for what is considered diplomacy but is spent on dealing with the aids crisis on dealing with the ethnic cleansing the genocide in sudan and throughout the world places where we could have such a constructive positive effect the arhount of money that is being requested in fiscal 2007 for this war iii iraq will bring the total amount requested by the bush administration to 490 billion an enormous sum the american people have to ask has this been worth it given the results to date but we know the results are more than 2 300 americans who have lost their lives in iraq more than 16 700 who have been wounded tens if not hundreds of thousands of iraqi casualties andyet osama bin laden is still on the run iraq now appears to be descending into an allout civil war and al qaeda recruitment levels are reportedly stronger than ever but while our men and women are risking their lives overseas at the instruction of this administration and of course we have great regard for their courage and sacrifice we are not being asked to sacrifice at home and in fact the people who have been the most rewarded by this great economythat was built on the investments that have been made in prior generationsthey are being asked to sacrifice the least in fact they are actually being rewarded the same time that these men and women are going to war we are continuing trillions of dollars of tax cuts that primarily benefit the very wealthiest in our society and yet these tax proposals are going to cost the american people about 3 trillion 3 trillion over the next decade the benefits from these tax cuts are heavily skewed toward the wealthy if they were to fix the alternative minimum tax for the middle class that would be one thing if they were to help workingclass families deal with the vulnerabilities they face in providing for their families that would be one thing but that is not where most of it goes more than half of these benefits go to the 4 percent of americans who make over 200 000 annually four years from now in 2010 taxpayers with incomes of more than 1 million a year will receive average tax cuts worth 155 000 100 times the tax cut that the average taxpayer will receive is that fair is that smart i dont think it is appropriate and i dont think it reflects americas priorities and they come at a huge cost to the fiscal security of this nation causing massive amounts of annual federal deficits over the last 4 years we have seen the largest deficits in the history of our nation mr scott is going to show you what has happened over the last 5 years on a chart i hope you will pay close attention it is unbelievable the current fiscal year 2006 is expected to produce the largest deficit ever in the history of our country at 423 billion and this doesnt even take into account the supplemental spending requests that the president will send up to the hill any day now which will increase the 2006 deficit to well over half a trillion dollars and fiscal 2007 will be another year of historic deficits predicted to be 354 billion in fact since president bush took office we have had the largest annual deficits in the history of this country and those numbers are net numbers after you take the social security surplus and offset it against general fund deficits so you can add another 200 billion annually to each of those numbers so we are creating debt of over 500 billion a year these deficits and the 8 trillion in debt we now have as a result of prior deficits will place on our children anti grandchildren an unprecedented level of debt burden because of these policies every child born today automatically inherits 28 000 as their share of the federal debt and under the presidents budget proposals a child born just 5 years from now will inherit a much larger share in fact they will be paying taxes for nearly the first 5 months of every year just to pay the interest on the debt that their parents generation incurred the presidents massive budget deficits also require us to borrow from foreign governments foreign investors now hold half of the countrys publicly held debt china alone holds 250 billion of the public debt which is more than 300 percent the amount that chinaheld only 5 years ago they have a fiscal guillotine over our necks if they chose to use it we are so dependent upon chinas being willing to borrow all this debt that we generate year after year let me just show you a chart in fact of this foreign debt mr kahn our very able staff director on the house budget committee has put this together this is the aggregate unitedstates national debt held by foreign countries now the debt was climbing during the reagan years in the 1980s continued to climb during the bush years during the beginning of the clinton years it started to top oft and then with president clinton having adopted the payasyougo policy of the first president bush having to pay for tax cuts as well as additional spending we got the budget under control we had an estimated 5 6 trillion surplus predicted for the succeeding decade go foreign debt would have gone down just like this and as our foreign debt went down our national security would have gone up but this administration decided they did not want to adopt the policies of the father they did not want any payasyougo they just wanted to cut taxes the heck with paying it we will send a credit card to the next generation they can pay off our debt that is their problem not ours we are going to live high off the hog we are going to reward our contributors and the fact is that that is exactly what has happened and we have driven this nation into debt but even more seriously look at what has happened to foreign debt foreign debt has gone up like this to here we are now at 1 5 trillion here we are at 1 175 trillion and here we are over 2 trillion in 2005 a substantial share being purchased by china as i just said a 300 percent increase in chinas share of the foreign debt but imagine what has happened to foreign debt since 2001 when this president took office talk about endangering national security now who pays for all of this well what happens is that the american people obviously pay our children will pay most of it but even today the sick and the elderly who need care that cannot be provided by their families will pay we will have our college students pay in reductions in student loans and basically the dignity and the upward mobility of the american working class is going to suffer for these policies this is a situation that is not sustainable that has to be reversed now everyone is entitled to their own ideological opinions i do not think they ought to be entitled to their own set of facts this is factual information you can check in any of these budget documents put out by the government you can find that the amount of debt has skyrocketed the amount of debt held by foreign nations has skyrocketed to an even greater degree we are dependent on countries like china to keep us afloat and in fact the working class has suffered our children are going to pay the bill and we are involved in a war that we are only paying for by borrowing from the future we have not paid one dime of the cost of the iraq war nor have we paid for the tax cuts that we have so blithely passed with this i would like to yield to mr scott who has been on the budget committee for several years and he is going to show you some shocking charts as well"],

again the american people are paying the price my colleagues have listed some of the abuses of power mr waxman in particular talked about what the impact is on the american consumer from some of those abuses of power imagine that the person managing the bill on prescription drugs left this house and soon was representing the pharmaceutical industry for 2 million a year in salary how much does it cost to sell the seniors down the river well about 2 million a year if you are the manager of the prescription drug bill that is why americans middleincome seniors will be paying more at the pharmacy because of the corruption that was involved in writing this bill a bill where the pharmaceutical industry insisted that there be a prohibition in the bill against the secretary of hhs for negotiating for lower prices it was in the bill because the pharmaceutical industry insisted upon it they had their representatives at the table americas seniors did not who do you think came out on top in that bill writing we have talked about a time when the american taxpayer has the burden of that plus paying a price at the pump because of the corruption in writing the energy policy for this country behind closed doors refusing to reveal what went into writing that legislation 3 1645 and that legislation do not take it from me the republican department of energy stated at the time that the energy bill proposed and passed by the republicans in this congress would increase the price at the pump they said it at the time so not only are the consumers paying the price at the pump and an increased cost in their home heating oil and cooling oil as we go into the summer months they gave a gift they the american taxpayers we gave a gift to the oil companies that same bill that increased the price at the pump that people are now paying nearly 3 a gallon for they those oil companies those same oil companies got subsidies of 12 billion in the energy bill they got royalty relief royalty holidays of several more billion dollars and to make matters worse in the most recent tax bill that is being prepared to coine to this floor they will get 5 5 billion more in tax breaks what are they taking the american taxpayer for what are they thinking of it is such an insult to the intelligence of the consumer and the taxpayer wait a minute at a time of record of record profits historic and obscene profits these companies are paying enormous fees the ceo of exxon is getting a retirement package of 400 million record profits high subsidies from the taxpayer and high prices at the pump a very raw deal for the american consumer all of it born from the culture of corruption in this house of representatives we must break that link we are here for the interests of the american people for the public interest the republicans are here for the special interests they are the handmaidens of the pharmaceutical industry they are the handmaidens of the energy companies they do not know any other way to do it and that is why we get not only bad policy not only corruption in this house not only a cost of that corruption to the taxpayer and to the consumer but we have a ruse of a bill that tries to masquerade as reform on this house of representatives i feel really sad about this i feel sad for the american people they expect and deserve better and we can give that to them in our motion to recommit that i talked about earlier it bans the gifts and travel it breaks the link it stops the revolving door it also says that if you are convicted of a felony in the performance of your duties as a member of this house you do not get your pension you do not get your pension and as i said again this whole thing about jet travel and the rest our motion to recommit would prohibit corporate travel for official purposes so i hope that our colleagues will understand that we certainly can do better and that the american people are watching that we can present substantive reforms some that we should be debating today i can assure my colleagues that these reforms that if we have these reforms we will end this culture of corruption i also assure you that if the democrats win the congress next year they will be implemented on the first day the first day of the first session of this next congress so let us start fresh with this the american people as i say expect and deserve better we can clear the slate by rejecting allout rejecting this ruse this pathetic pathetic little tiny step that is a missed opportunity for a high ethical standard and is an excuse to keep the culture of corruption that is here i urge my colleagues to vote no on this rule and if the opportunity presents itself to support the democratic motion to recommit i want to in closing commend thb ranking

passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine that is moving in the right direction i believe that the tax relief package and the tax cuts that we passed are a large part ofthat"], [0.9960058927536011, 0.003994107246398926, 1,

while we were considering the appropriations bill we offered and adopted in committee an amendment that gave authority to the secretary to adopt regulations relating to the security of chemical plants we envisioned that as being a temporary solution while the authorizers had time at some point to pass regular authorizing legislation that was stricken by a point of view on the house floor in the senate fortunately in an amendment by bob byrd adopted that same amendment and that is what we had in conference there then proceeded negotiations between the authorizers and it ended up being a partisan negotiation between majority members in the house and senate which produced the recommended plan forthe regulation of chemical plants which the conference committee substituted for the byrd amendment that more detailed recommendation has not been subject to debate in either the house or the senate or considered in that form by any of our committees and it has four provisions which i think significantly weakens the authority of the secretary to adopt regulations i think we should strike them the first one is a provision that states that the secretary may not disapprove a site security plan submitted under this section based on the pres ence or absence of a particular security measure what that means i frankly do not know the reality is that any security measure is going to deal with a whole series of particular security measures some are going to be more important than the other why we limit the authority of the secretary in this fashion is beyond me i do not know what it means there must be some relevance to it but it clearly would seem to limit the ability of the secretary to adopt a comprehensive security measure then we have another provision which is rather strange and it says that if we proceed in court and any information is provided on plants to that court then that unclassified information becomes classified when it reaches the courtroom i know of no other instance in our government where unclassified information becomes classified because it goes to court i have no idea what the precedent for any such action is it is unique it is new and we should not have it in this bill i do not know as i read this bill whether the states have the ability to adopt security standards which are stricter than the federal law some read this language to say it prohibits the states from having stricter standards i read it as being unclear and where we turn that issue over is not to our judgment but to the courts as i read the language if a state adopts stricter saandards and the secretary approves them i expect it will be challenged in court if they adopt stricter standards and the secretary rejects them that will be challenged in court in my judgment the states should have that ability but whether we think they should or should not have it it is a decision we should make and not simply leave it to the vagaries of what a particular court might decide another provision in this bill simply says that it prohibits the public from filing any suit to enforce the provisions of this law again that makes no sense to me and goes contrary to what we normally do in this country i am glad we are finally moving for ward with chemical plant security however the negotiations not by the conferees on the appropriation bill but by the negotiators from the two authorizing committees have produced a version of chemical security regulation that in my judgment is much weaker than it need be and we should clarify it and strike those provisions not add anything new but simply make sure that the secretary has greater authority and to make sure that states have the right to adopt stricter regulation if they so desire so i urge the rejection of the previous question so that we can offer such an amendment"], [0.0011764466762542725, 0.4988235533237457, 0, "some might the senate has passed senator mccains not know this but my state of mississippi

nuclear test site kazakhstan accepted support from the unitedstates department of energy and readily complied with the nuclear threat initiative blending down over 6 000 pounds of weapons grade highly
