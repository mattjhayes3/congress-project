turning point in the 2 000year struggle by the jewish people to achieve selfdetermination the jewish people who had suffered many centuries of persecution and had experienced the bitterness and

national park in washington state the property lies along the north shore of lake quinault and upstream along the quinault river that drains into the lake the valley provides access to the southwest portion of the park the legislation would revise the park boundaries to exclude about twothirds of this private land from the park the exclusion would include three platted subdivisions the sites of some commercial activity and a number of farms and residences the onethird of the land that would remain within the park is less developed and provides some of the best habitat for the elk herds whose protection was a chief reason for originally including the qulnault valley in the park this plan would also insure future public ownership of the entire north bank of the river upstream from the lake these private lands are the remnants of the homesteads of the original nonindian settlers of the quinault valley ancestors of these people still live in the valley and their ties with the land and desires to preserve their way of life are very strong residents of the area are also justifiably concerned about maintaining an adequate property base to accommodate community growth and to support adequate community services the presence in the area of the national park the olympic national forest the quinault indian reservation and extensive state holdings make this a very real concern that the bill will help address since this land has been within the park the national park service has been responsible for law enforcement road maintenance and other government services that are traditionally local concerns the agency is not well suited for such tasks and residents dislike having to rely on nonelected officials of a large federal agency for such services the people clearly prefer to work with local officials on these matters and finally the bill settles the four decades of uncertainty that valley residents say has gone with living under what they feel is a nearconstant

to~help the rich i hope we will not continue down a deadend street of believing in what president reagan calls the magic of the marketplace empirical evidence of six recessions in the postwar period resulting from similar tight monetary and regressive fiscal policies now being pursued documents the fallacy of feeding the fat and starving the lean economics for those who care to think objectively and to heed commonsense i am inserting into the record the report of the national advisory council on economic opportunity a governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly

restraint we are called upon to defer and even dismantie a broad range of federal programs long regarded as essential to the wellbeing of our society but before we come to a decision on these proposals i believe it is imperative that we examine most carefully the mechanism that has been offered for arriving at that decision the reconciliation process the members should understand clearly that if this mechanism is accepted on this issue it will have a significant and i submit unfortunate impact on the way in which congress legislates now and in the future in formulating the congressional budget act the reconciliation concept was suggested by charles schultze who proposed that congress use the same method for finalizing its budget as is used by the executive branch the legislative history also supports the position that reconciliation was intended to implement the determinations made in the second or final budget resolution for a fiscal year but that was not the case last yearthe first time reconciliation was implemented on the spending sidenor is it the situation this year there are those who say that in these unprecedented economic times reconciliation is a necessary procedure but it must also be said that inclusion of reconciliation in the first budget resolution significantly diminishes the responsibilities of thq authorizing comnmittees for making policy decisions in a meaningful fashion it precludes meaningful analysis forecloses debate imposes serious time constraints and serves to undermine rather than strengthen the overall lekislative and budget processes if it is the decision of congress to reduce federal spending then so be it but i do not believe the mechanism for that decision should be reconciliation in the first budget resolution nor should reconciliation in any spending resolution call for spending reductions in the mutyears neither approach is contemplated by the budget act reconciliation was designed to bring spending in line with the budget ceiling for a particular year not future years section 310 of the budget act is clear on this as is section 301 b 2 which specifically limits ireconciliation to the enactment of spending legislation for the coming fiscal year we can achieve the reductions necessary in fiscal years 198284 by lowering the total budget ceilings for those years when we enact the budget resolutions attempting to force those reductions now prior to consideration of thle budget resolution for those years does violence to the budget act and robs congress of the flexibility it must have if federal spending is to be controlled and sound fiscal policy achieved in addition it is my understanding that the senate budget committee has directed the senate committees to cut through the reconciliation process authorization as wvell as direct spending programs in some cases this involves reductions in programs which have not as yet been authorized in all cases it involves matters which fall within the spending jurisdiction of the appropriations committees and should not under the budget act be targeted for reduction by the authorizing committees i for one hope that this house would resist anymovement in this direction in the upcoming conference on the budget resolution one of the primary purposes of the budget act was to fashion a process whereby the authorization and appropriation committees would make spending and fiscal decisions in an orderly and meaningful manner however that is not the situation we see today nearly 71 years after the adoption of the budget act recognizing this i believe that the time is now ripe to begin work on making the budget process an even more useful exercise by reaffirming the intended role of the authorizing committees in talking to other members i know that there is great interest in doing so and i am committed to wvorking with all members to insure thle success of that effort i would now like to address the issues contained in the socalled grammlatta substitute which are of concern to the committee on public works and transportation the funding levels assumed for some of our major program areas and the reconciliation instructions given to our committee with respect to public works issues the grammlatta substitute differ from the budget committee resolution in three specific program areas urban mass

subsidies for fiscal year 1982 by 260 million in budget authority and 130 million in outlays through acceleration of the phaseout for these subsidies coiiversely the house budget committee resolution while assuming the presidents spending level for fiscal year 1982 rejects the phaseout and proposes for fiscal year 1983 an additional 400 million in budget authority and 200 million in outlays and for fiscal year 1984 750 million in budget authority and 500 million in outlays in function 450 community and regional development the graninilatta substitute restores for fiscal year 1982 100 million in budget authority and 12 million in outlays to thle administrations proposals for eda cvelopment loan and other grant programs it goes on however to assume its termination at the end of fiscal year 1982 thle budget committee resolution assumes for fiscal year 1982 a funding level of 350 million in budget authority and 100 million in outlays with sufficient funding for fiscal years 1983 and 1984

program the budget committee assumed in its resolution 750 million and 400 million respectively for these programs in all three instances i believe that the budget committees resolution more accurately strikes a balance between spending cuts and program needs of equal concern to me is the reconciliation directive contained in thle orammlatta substitute unlike the budget committee

unintended effect of the many statutes and regulations which provide jurisdiction over civil rights complaints has often been to deny swift and fair justice for persons who have been discriminated against the backlog in federal agencies creates unnecessary delays additional costs and causes further overcrowding in already overburdened federal courts this problem is not endemic to the reagan

of 5 years begun began teaching hebrew and became one of the leading protagonists in the struggle for jewish renaissance in the unitedstatess r his arrest on november 7 1982 under the charge of

told you to do it your editorial boards told you to do it your constituents told you to do it heaven forbid you as a member of congress should be asked to read the budget document look at it and really know what is in it i find when people say to me we want ybu to back the reagan program i say oh are you for tobacco subsidies well no we are not for that i say well it is in the reagan budget and i go through about 10 more things and they continue to say oh is that in there look our job in this body is to kno~w what is in the budget and that is what we are talking about i think that the black caucus is to be complimented for having looked at what was in the reagan budget being horrified andcoming forward with an excellent program that i can support and i will support the black caucus proposal really does some things that we are no longer supposed to talk about anymore we are not supposed to talk about care and compassion anymore that is passe but the black caucus and jones budgets do deal with that they deal with human priorities they deal with balancing the budget and turning the economy around they deal with all of those things it is a different list of priorities it does not contain the priorities of the lobbyist in the 500 suit it has the priorities of the people who i think deserve the focus of this attention i think the government should be evaluated by whether or not they are trying to help people who are in the less fortunate situation rather than the most fortunate situation you will not get cuff links if you vote for the black caucus or jones budgets i cannot believe that learjet owners have been able to get out from under the reagan budget cuts thank goodness they are not going to have to pay to help maintain the nations airports we all know how costly it is to maintain a learjet these days and they have been able to escape because of their plight wait a minute what am i saying i am saying this is a class budget let us talk about that thank goodness the black caucus has recognized it and done something about it ifthis fails i will support the jones budget i think he has done a wonderful job everyone in this room would like to write everything a little bit differently i understand that i am a congregationalist by background and we always figured that if any two of us totally agreed one of us ns superfluous it is the same with this body but we have to sit down and make some hard choices they have made some hard choices we must line up behindone of these budgets rather than pout that we could not present our perfect one let us talk about a few issues the reagan budget that is probably going to be passed today i wish we could vote on it without coats so we could see the presidential cuff links go in the air the reagan budget that will probably be passed by the shiny new cuff links is not new it has been tried by england we are now told that over 600 businesses a week are failing in england that inflation is not under control and they have had the worst race riots the country has ever seen so we are going to say this is a terrific program let us sign up let us do it also forget it that is crazy qrammlatta reagan is also a gigantic transfer amendment let us talk some more about this budget that is probably going to pass i think it is awful that the japanese prime minister is on his way to this country to tell us that yes while they will have the second highest gross national product in the world this year heaven forbid we should ask them to help support any of the american troops that are providing defense for them in their country or heaven forbid we should ask them for help to pay for some of the ships that we are keeping out there so they can flood the country with their subarus"], [0.000306546688079834,

committee and in this body we will miss him greatly in the next congress second because i recognize that honda has established itself in the united states and recognized its responsibility to the unitedstates economy and workers that is something that i think we ought to encourage indeed this legislation is designed to encourage honda and other foreign manufacturers to establish facilities in the united states and put american workers back to work the reason i have to oppose this legislation however is that it is special interest legislation that would just affect one motor company the honda motor co and the legislation would have the effect of discriminating in favor of honda against other foreign manufacturers like vw that established manufacturing in the united states earlier than honda did and against unitedstates manufacturers who are under stringent restrictions with respect to the outsourcing of their manufacturers i will illustrate in a moment the degree to which that

the very positive news that the inflation rate at the wholesale level is 3 7 percent in the pasi 23 months we have started to turn the corner on the burden of regulation which has been imposed on the private sector in this country now we are looking at something that is going to blatantly create problems for the consumer and fuel inflation once again if we adopt sweeping domestic content requirements we can be sure that other nations will quickly retaliate if the united states as the leading economic force in the free world erects such a blatantly protectionist trade law other nations

"indeed the bill that we are considering right now there are specific authorizations for the bi bomber and the mx missile system i like this procedure i believe the american people like it and approve it we all value having elected representatives make decisions on issues of this magnitude i want that procedure to continue but the bill before us would abandon this timehonored procedure i would give away the store by allowing dod to make the final decisions on contracts involving hundreds of millions of dollars that is just not consistent with my conception of representative government the amendment proposed by the government operations committee most assuredly permits the defense department to engage in multiyear contracting it does so however in a manner which allows input by the congress our amendment would allow the dod to select any number of projects that it feels are ready and appropriate for multiyear contracting these projects would then be presented to the congress which would either approve or disapprove them on a projectbyproject basis i ask you what is unreasonable about that under th government operations committee approach the congress would have the opportunity to implement the concept selectively while learning about the pitfalls as well as benefits of multiyear contracting and most important we would be able to exercise our independent judgment on which projects are worthwhile and which are not this amendment has been character ized by some as antidefense let me assure the members of the housd that this is not so the amendment is prodefense but unlike the armed services alternative it allows an active role for the congress now as i said earlier multiyear funding is a good step but it ought to be done very carefully in the testimony before our committee the omis indicated that the office of federal procurement policy which was established as a result of a recommendation of the procurement commission will have before us and make public by october its recommendations for governmentwide policy with regard to procurement one of the areas that is to be covered is the multiyear funding omb deputy director harper indicated that it was well with regard to multiyear funding to wait until that report could be made so that we would have governmentwide multiyear funding rather than a specific type of multiyear funding for the department of defense and then another type for the rest of the government that is why we got into the problem in the first place with procurement because we had the dod doing one thing we had the gsa doi g something else we had nasa doing something else and other agencies doing other things with regard to procurement the government operations committee in its wisdom recommended the establishment of this commission wvhich after 2 years of consideration of this subject said that we ought to have governmentwide policy rather than have one agency doing it one way and have another agency do it another now for us to take this step with multiyear funding for the department of defense without any projectbyproject control as we have set it up in the government operations committee amendment in my judgment is going back to point zero where we had started when we first had the need for the procurement commission i am afraid we are going to have the need for another procurement commission in order to get this mess straightened out so why should we not wait until that office of federal procurement policy makes its judgment makes its recommendation not only in multiyear funding in this area but multiyear funding throughout the federal government mr harper said there would be other areas in which there would be multiyear funding i think we shoull wait until that report and that recommendation for governmentwide policy is before us rather than to jump in here and give the department of defense what they want a blank check without any restrictions as far as the congress is concerned in lieu of this is the government operations committee compromise it allows us to multiyear procure on a projectbyproject basis put in as many as you want this year and then let the congress pass on it"]]}
