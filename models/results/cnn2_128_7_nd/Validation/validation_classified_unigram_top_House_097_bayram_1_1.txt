aspects of this measure which deserve special attention i would like to comment on one which touches an extremely valuable but often forgotten segment of our populationamerican citizens living overseas our nation is a nation built on commerce we have thrived over the years because we have encouraged the american entrepreneur to open new markets and create new jobs the sons and daughters of the new deal have struggled to insure that their fanilies and communities are strong and that those who have not shared fully in our bounty are protected yet for the past 20 years we as a government have not allowed our citizens living and working abroad to pursue fully the american ideal of free competition the main fault lies in our policy of taxing overseas unitedstates citizens we are the only industrialized nation in the free world which taxes its citizens living in other countries companies have found it uneconomical to hire americans overseas since h 4490 co japanese germans englishmen or other nationals do not have to pay taxes to their home country this has led to a massive exodus of americans from the international economic and ideological marketplace and resulted in reduced exports loss of jobs at home and loss of influence abroad america has been able to achieve its present high standard of living because our government has traditionally encouraged domestic and international trade as a member and past chairman of the house export task force i am convinced that our policy of taxing americans overseas has severely hampered our rnbillty to compete the gao the georgetown center for strategic and international studies the presidents export council chase econometrics the unitedstates trade representative the commerce department and many others have joined me in this assessment the american entrepreneur abroad does more to build respect and admiration for the free enterprise system than all the tanks and airplanes we could ever deploy the thoughtful and dedicated overseas american does more to bring about a better understanding of our political ideals and institutions than all the information services we might attempt to use as a substitute the economic development of the rest of the world and the creation of markets for american products are fostered more by dedicated unitedstates entrepreneurs than by all of our bilateral and multilateral assistance programs combined it is time for us to adopt the standard used by the rest of the world in taxing its overseas citizens that isthe residence principle which requires the individual to pay taxes where he lives according to chase econometrics this policy would result in a net revenue gain to the treasury of over 5 billion a year through creation of new exportrelated jobs at home perhaps more important this would also encourage americans to live overseas and transmit our concept of freedom and worth of the individual to other societies adoption of the residence tax principle is truly in our national interest and will contribute greatly to our national securityat no 2axpense to the american taxpayer i therefore urge this house to support proposal such as h r 4016 which would apply the residence principle to income earned overseas i hope that this policy will soon be extended to all americans living abroad our 20year experiment with taxing americans overseas has cost us billions of dollars in lost exports millions of lost jobs and incalculable lost influence it should be ended now"], [0.403137743473053, 0.596862256526947, 1, "today 1 along with several of our colleagues

1982 at national bald eagle day on june 20 1782 pursuant to an act of congress the american bald eagle became our nations symbol and national bird the bald eagle was chosen by the founding fathers because of its singleminded commitment to the protection of its young and the defense of its home the american experience of the past 200 years bears ample evidence that the spirit of the american bald eagle has surely infused itself into the american psyche we have looked to the american bald eagle as a symbol of strength courage determination and beauty and it is precisely these qualities that have come to denote the greatness of our nation it is indeed ironic and sad that the american bald eagle has been listed as an endangered species pursuant to the endangered species act of 1973 as our nation expanded westward from the original 13 states the clearing of the land and other forms of human encroachment drastically reduced the nesting and roosting habitat of the american bald eagle while scientists estimao that perhaps as many as 20 000 american bald eagles can be found in the state of alaska only 1 000 nesting pairs are believed to roam the skies of the lower 48 states fortunately this sad tale is being turned around thanks to the concerted efforts of federal state local and private agencies and organizations several federal government agencies including the fish and wildlife service the forest service the bureau of land management and the corps of engineers run american bald eagle conservation programs i am particularly proud of the new york state department of environmental conservations program the dec has just completed the first of two 5year bald eagle management programs the second plan already in progress calls for the release the 21 bald eagles from a single hacking site in 1981 and the release of 129 bald eagles through the end of 1985 i know that our colleagues can boast of similar success in their states and regions this public effort is being augmented by an aggressive private campaign several wildlife conservation organizations including the national wildlife federation and eagle vally environmentalists are engaged in ongoing advocacy education and action programs designed to heighten public awareness of the american bald eagles plight and encourage conservation activities i i can think of no better way for the congress to reaffirm our support for these necessary efforts then by designating the year 1982 as the bicentennial year of the american bald eagle and june 20 1982 as national bald eagle day the joint resolution i am introducing today calls upon people throughout the nation to observe such year and day and authorizes and requests that the president issue a proclamation to this end send a copy of the

insured for millions of americans the precious right to vote a right which is the cornerstone of all other rights the renewal of the voting rights act will emphatically reinforce our nations commitment to democracy and universal suffrage the passing of time may sometimes cloud the historical monumentality of the voting rights act but this lesson must not be forgotten before the implementation of the act the enormous burden of the casebycase litigative approach to enforcing voting rights left overwhelming numbers of minorities disenfranchised in 1964 for example less than 7 percent of the voting age black population in mississippi was registered to vote today that figure stands at more than 60 percent facts such as these from throughout the deep south dramatically convey the type of civil rights progress directly attributable to the voting rights act despite substantial advancement of voting rights the battle is not yet won during hearings on the act extensive evidence was presented showing the perpetuation of efforts to exclude minorities from the electoral process at all stages sadly such injustices are continuing 17 years after the original passage of the voting rights act clearly extension of the act is still an essential element in the civil rights struggle any retreat in its provisions would jeopardize the gains of the last two decades and threaten continuation of the status quo where discrimination still exists there are those who still argue that some of the acts provisions are too cumbersome that the passing of time has rendered them obsolete the changing complexion of our society refutes this argument however for example the section of the act calling for bilingual elections where a substantial foreign language minority exists helps insure voting rights for a growing segment of the population we have heard talk as well about removing the preclearance provision of the act or making the bailout section far too lenient but these aspects of the act give it real clout and must not be severely weakened by those who seek to fine tune the act we must not underestimate the importance of the voting rights act extension as franklin delano roosevelt once stated so eloquently the only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people in a democracy the ability to vote is perhaps the most basic and vital right a citizen can possess if we retreat in any way from our cokimitment to protecting the right of suffrage wve shall surely threaten the foundations of our society there is no greater danger to our domestic tranquility than the possibility of alienating scores of citizens from the electoral process we have made great strides in expanding the freedoms of american citizens in the last two decades there is no reason to believe that we cannot enjoy far greater advancemuent on this front in the years ahead the extension of the voting rights act is an indispendable element in keeping that hope alive i urge all of my colleagues to support the extension of this landmark civil rights bill which serves as both a symbol of freedom and a practical way of

providing for an intensive effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate the discharge of pollutants into our nations waters the federal water pollution control act amendments of 1972 set increasingly stringent standards for discharges of industrial and municipal wvastes for municipal wastes it required secondary treatment by 1977 and the application of best practicable waste water treatment technology by 1983 the 1977 date for secondary treatment was later extended to 1983 for those communities which were unable to meet the date because of a lack of federal funding in connection with these new requirements for secondary and best practicable treatment the act provided a 75 percent federal grant share for construction of publicly owned treatment works the grants were to be available for such categories as secondary treatment more stringent treatment infiltration inflow correction major sewer system rehabilitation new collector sewers interceptors and appurtenances and correction of combined sewer overflows earlier this year the administration proposed drastic changes in the construction grants program this was coupled with an announcement that fiscal year 1982 funding would not be supported unless the congress passed legislation making changes in the program also as part of this process the reconciliation act reduced the fiscal year 1982 furlding to zero with the provision that 2 4 billion would be authorized in the event that legislative changes are enacted into law the conference report i bring to the floor represents the response of the house and the senate to the administrations call for changes in the program it recognizes the need to reduce federal participation in the program in view of existing and expected budgetary constraints however and this is most important the states and localities are given a period of time in which to adjust to and make accommodations for their increased responsibility the eligibilities for grants remain essentially intact until october 1 1984 after that date the federal share will be reduced from its current 75 percent to 55 percent in addition categories of treatment works eligible for grant assistance will be limited to secondary and more advanced treatment interceptors and correction of infiltration inflow problems however up to 20 percent of a states annual allotment as determined by~the governor may be used to fund otherwise iiieligible categories such as collector sewers sewer rehabilitation and correction of combined sewer overflows with regard to reserve capacity projects which receive a step 3 construiction grant for a treatment plant or interceptor prior to october 1 1984 will remain eligible for grant assistance for 20 years for reserve capacity in the funding of the remainder of the treatment plant and 20 to 40 years for interceptors for projects receiving the first construction grant after october 1 1984 federal grant assistance will be limited to the capacity needed to meet the needs industrial and residential existing as of the date of award of the step 3 construction grant however grant assistance will not be available for needs over and above those existing on october 1 1990 with regard to the federal share if a step 3 construction grant is approved before october 1 1984 for a segment of a treatment plant or interceptor then subsequent grants for the rest of the treatment plant interceptors and infiltration inflow correction will be at 75 percent the statement of managers includes language urging the appropriation of funds to implement section 2 06 of the federal water pollution control act this section provides a mechanism for the reimbursement of communities which proceed with construction of treatment works at their own expense if the treatment works meet all of the requirements of the act this enables communities to save money by moving ahead before federal funds are available and thus avoid the increased costs associated with inflation this provision of the act however has not been funded in appropriations acts this has resulted in an unfortunate and unnecessary increase in cost for t~he program both to local interests and to the federal government with the reductions in federal assistance incorporated in h r 4503 it is even more necessary that ways be found to decrease overall costs associated with the reduction of pollution of our nations waters permitting construction at presentday prices with reimbursement later is one way of doing this one glaring example of the types of difficulties which are created because of the lack of proper implementation of the reimbursement provision in the act is found in the district of my distinguished colleague mr mottm the four communities of rocky river bay village fairview park and westlake in suburban cleveland ohio built a sewer treatment plant with epa guidance however when this pilot program plant was completed it turned out that it did not operate properly the plant when finally completed with design modifications will serve about 80 000 residents the attempts on the part of local communities to receive reimbursement from epa go back many years they have been unsuccessful both because of the lack of funding for section 206 and because of epas unwarranted allegation that the project involving as it does advanced technology of an experimental nature does not meet the criteria of a normal construction grant project i wish to assure the gentleman that in my opinion the local communities are entitled to reimbursement and should be reimbursed upon the appropriation of funds for that purpose there is one other provision in the conference agreement that i would like to mention section 4 provides that the administrator shall make a grant from any

the eity of san diego is planning to construct a wastewatertopotable recycle system the product of this system will be not only treated sewage but potable water this is the type of innovative and alternative project which is truly worthwhile because of its potential for establishing the practicability of reclaiming water for municipal purposes this is the sort of thing which should be

inseparable section 4 embodies this principle section 4 also provides that the administrator shall make grants from funds allotted to the state of california for mitigation features associated with waste treatment projects in san francisco and eureka calif grants for these features were approved by the state pursuant to its delegated authority and were not disapproved by epa until some time later the provisions in section 4 are designed to correct the inequity which would result if the local communities were now required to pay the cost associated vith these features after proceeding under the assumption that they would be grant eligible i am including as part of my statement a brief sectionbysection analysis of the bill agreed to by the conferees i believe this is a workable bill

shale leasing to occur in colorado utah and wyoming it adjusts lease sizes so that commercially viable leases can be issued in the poorer quality shale areas of utah and wyoming thereby lessening the

first provision allows the secretary of the interior to lease minerals that are comingled with oil shale provided they cannot otherwise be mined economically second there exists a provision to allow for maximum recovery by leasing small tracts which would be bypassed as unecoiomic by themselves the bill solves the problem of disposing shale after the oil has been extracted by providing noncontiguous offsite leases for this purpose no oil shale development may occur on these tracts and they are available only to federal lessees h r 4053 assures the governors of the affected states

opportunity to give this matter the individual attention i feel it deserves tn put it bluntly our method has been neither good legislative practice nor a very humane way to proceed there are indecd several categories receiving tie minimum benefit who either have not earned it or do not deserve it but that does not give the congress license to remove it from the nearly 1 million truly needy now

benefit it is estimated that over 800 000 are probably without alternative sources of income a million and a half are over 70 and about 100 000 are over 90 should the minimum benefit continue to be paid to current beneficiaries it will gradually decrease as a drain on both the trust fund and general revenues which add ssi supplements to the minimum current trust fund payments of the minimum will gradually sink to zero over the next two decades the decrease will be even more pronounced if only the truly needy continue to receive the minimum benefit the house has before it an opportunity to declare that the reconciliation process is not the best mechanism to make farreaching changes in complex social security law careful and deliberate consideration by both the house ways and means committees is vastly preferable to precipitate action on a catchall measure not designed to take into account distinctions between the comparative needs of various minimumbenefit categories i do believe that certain categories of beneficiaries do not need nor have they truly earned the minimum benefit there are 450 000 minimum recipients who receive federal pensions averaging 900 per month 350 000 minimum recipients have working spouses with earnings averaging 14 000 annually but to deny minimum benefits to people in their 80s and 90s and to elderly men and women to religious orders who have devoted their lives to their fellow americans is not responsible legislation to do so now when the minimum benefit currently makes up a major portion of their total income is also unwise what i am saying is that distinctions must be made between the various currently eligible categories this must be done through the regular legislative process i realize that in order to protect the shortand longterm integrity of the social security trust funds we must make some retrenchments we must place the social security system on a basis which guarantees benefits to every american who has
