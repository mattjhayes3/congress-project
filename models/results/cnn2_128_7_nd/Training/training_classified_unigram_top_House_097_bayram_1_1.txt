works and transportation on october 7 1981 s 1611 amends public law 90553 enacted on october 9 1968 and known as the international center act to expand and bring to completion the planned international center within the federally owned bureau of standards site at van ness street and connecticut avenue in northwest washington d c passage of the international center act in 1968 was essential to partially alleviate the critical shortage of suitable space for location of chanceries and related facilities of foreign governments in the nations capital an issue of increasing concern to the department of state in the discharge of its federal functions the site for vhe center located at the south half of the old bureau of standards site in northwest washington was to be developed by the secretary of state from proceeds of sale or lease to foreign governments or an international organization development controls and a master plan applicable to the site were approved and adopted by the national capital planning commission on june 3 1971 the international center was to provide chanceries for approximately 14 foreign governments and a headquarters building on a parcel not to exceed 8 acres for the organization of american states oas the latter was intended to provide multilingual conference and other facilities needed for a diplomatic center and to obtain a proper density of development adjacent to the connecticut avenue corridor and the metro system in 1973 it was found that sufficient capital was not available from potential purchasing governments to fund the development of the site in absence of clear evidence to complete at least the first phase of site development public law 9340 signed in may 1973 authorized 2 2 million to allow the secretary of state to initiate site development the remaining site development costs would be provided through the sale of lease of property at the center to foreign governments such sales would also provide funds to reimburse the treasury for all funds expended from the appropriation of the 2 2 million the chancery section project ultimately will be constructed at no cost to the government and the cost of actual construction of chancery facilities will be borne by the foreign governments development of chancery sites at the international center has proceeded in accordance with master plans and site and building plans approved by the national capital planning commission ncpc the general services administration has had overall responsibility for demolition excavation site preparation streets parks and utilities each foreign government then builds its own chancery at its expense on land leased at the center the chancery lots are being developed in two main phases this is necessary since the university of the district of columbia formerly occupied two buildings located on four of the chancery lots phase 1 which provides for the preparation of 10 of the planned 14 lots is essentially completed as of october 1 1981 the department of state has signed leases with eight countries jordan israel ghana yemen bahrain libya kuwait and qatar discussions on the remaining plots are now being conducted with various governments s 1611 will amend the international center act to provide for a 12acre expansion area known as the northwest quadrant adjacent to the present site to accommodate chanceries and related facilities for up to eight additional governments within the existing federally owned area the additional 12 acres together with the 34 acres available under the original act will accommodate approximately 23 chanceries of smaller to mediumsized foreign missions the bill provides for the development of a headquarters facility for an international organization other than the organization of american states as contemplated in the original act in order to complete the international center in accordance with the federal element of the comprehensive plan for the national capital the oas has occupied alternative space thus the department of state has concluded lease negotiations with the international telecommunications satellite organization lastly the bill authorizes the department of state to utilize proceeds realized from the lease sale or exchange of land in the international center to defray development costs as is the current practice at the center the project would be completed without any additional request for appropriated funds the secretary is also authorized to utilize proceeds subject to appropriations for maintenance and security on those properties within the site which have not been conveyed to a government or international organization and for surveys and plans related to development of additional areas within the nations capital for chancery and diplomatic purposes the unitedstates government as part of its international obligations is required to assist foreign governments to obtain suitable premises for chanceries in the district of columbia in accordance with the vienna convention on diplomatic relations of 1961 which entered into force as a treaty for the united states on december 13 1972 of equal importance there is a growing need for reciprocity involving the substantial problems of the unitedstates missions overseas the department of state is now unable to meet these obligations due to the current unavailability of suitable chancery sites in the district because of security costs and restrictive zoning problems this situation is now creating an adverse impact on our foreign relations and the ability of the united states to support our needs abroad accordingly enactment of this legislation will assist in alleviating this critical problem by providing additional suitable sites for the location of foreign missions in a securely protected international enclave as well as assist the united states abroad with respect to our missions through reciprocity lastly enactment of this

sale of revenue bonds for financing college and university programs which provide loans for the payment of educational expenses for or on behalf of students this authority will be available to all of the universities in the district of columbia h r 6276 is essentially a minor amendment to the bill h r 4910 which was passed and signed into aw last year it simply adds to the list of permissible purposes for revenue bonds the sale of such bonds for the purpose of financing a student loan program this legislation is required to insure that bonds could be sold for this purpose the committee view is that the district of columbia should have the right to make its own decision regarding the advisibility of undertaking such a program this legislation does not imply congressional endorsement of such a bond sale rather it simply is a logical extension of bonding authority already held by the district this legislation is prompted by the possibility of a reduction in student loan funds from federal sources the actual need for such loan funds the quantity of such loan funds and the advisibility of selling revenue bonds to finance such a loan pool was not analyzed by the committee rather it was the position of the committee that these issues should be determined by the district government as in all cases should district legislation be enacted to sell bonds such legislation would lay over for congressional review i would also like to point out that this legislation neither causes nor implies any federal government financing or responsibility for these bonds the subcommittee on

body about the importance of and the problems found in the army national guard onethird of the armys combat divisions are in the army national guard when all infantry battalions are considered including mechanized the army national guard represents over half of the total as well as half of the artillery battalions 29 percent of the standard aviation assets over 70 percent of the separate brigades about 60 percent of the armored cavalry regiments and onethird of the special forces groups manning the force and maintaining its strength has been the primary concern of the army national guard since the end of the draft from fiscal year 1974 to 1978 strength declined from 411 000 to 344 000 this delcine has ended and manning figures are now on the upswing despite this encouraging trend the actual fiscal year 1980 end strength was 53 000 below peacetime objectives and 69 000 below wartime requirements many of the problems perceived as inherent in the allvolunteer force today are reflected in the army national guard closely related to the question of sheer numbers of people is the lack of a skill and grade mix compatible with combat requirements attrition rates are high further the quality of recruits as defined by those possessing a high school diploma has declined substantially since the end of the draft there is a growing concern in some quarters that the allvolunteer force and its reserve spinoffs particularly the army reserve and the army national guard do not reflect the basic framework of american society and have a disproportionate percentage of the socially and eocnomically disadvantaged army national guard officials point out that all is not gloomy the minimum standard of not enlisting more than 18 percent of nonpriorservice personnel in test category iv has been met with actual enlistments averaging less than 10 percent since fiscal year 1978 concurrently test categories i and ii have shown steady increases the number of high school ceniors has continued to increase so that high school seniors and high school graduates totaled 61 percent of nonpriorservice accessions the army national guard has also maintained the minimum standard of enlisting not more than 45 percent nonhigh school graduates for fiscal year 1981 the goal for high school graduates and seniors has been raised to 60 percent of all nonpriorservice enlistments in addition to manpower uncertainties the other ominous cloud on the horizon is the equipment situation the army national guard has on hand only 69 percent of its wartime inventory in terms of dollar value if further resources are allocated to filling pomcus sets there will be an even greater deterioration of readiness capability the army national guard is short 1 400 2vaton trucks 1 900 5ton trucks 3 400 armored personnel carriers and 300 artillery pieces serious shortfalls also exist in areas such as organizational and protective clothing spare parts and logistics support equipment in army guard aviation 345 of 357 attack helicopters in the inventory are nondeployable as well as 392 of 884 observation helicopters this calls into serious question whether these guard units despite their programed combat role in defense planning scenarios can deploy and fight further compounding the situation is the lack of compatibility equipment in a sufficient state of repair to be usable is often not compatible with equipment in the active components in combat this could result in severe operational and support problems additionally it greatly reduces the effectiveness of joint active reserve component exercises which guard and reserve leaders have found to be one of the most productive sources of both morale and readiness the rederve forces policy board in its readiness assessment of the reserve components for fiscal year 1980 rates the overall readiness level of the army national guard on a steady increase despite the manning and equipment caveats previously outlined the board also emphasizes that the shortage of medical persohnel remains a critical problem for mobilization twentyone percent of the armys medical units are in the army national guard they would be urgently needed in support of the guards combat role upon mobilization by 1976 as the last of the vietnamera draftees were completing their periods of obligated service all health care specialties in the army national guard were seriously undermanned army guard officials have directed considerable attention to medical recruiting since that time so that the trend has been gradually reversed over the past few years the nurse and dental corps have reached their authorized levels innovative training programs are increasing the numbers of physicians assistants and practical nurses physicians remain the most nagging problem despite improvements the army national guard had only 46 7 percent of its authorized requirement of doctors at the end of fiscal year 1980 the army guard has intensified doctor recruiting and additional progress is anticipated this year nonetheless the medical situation further degrades the already tenuous readiness capabilities of the army national guard in the days ahead we should be mindful of the great importance to our national security the army national guard plays if the guard is to fulfill its mission in future years we must

ashbrook whose funeral services are being held today and as i understand it the reason why we have no legislative business this afternoon though the gentleman from ohios philosophy of government and mine may perhaps be described as quite different if not diametrically opposed i had nothing but respect and appreciation for his dignified manner his behavior and his record as a member of this house today i continue the effort along the lines and in pursuance of the two resolutions and the two bills that i have introduced with respect to the federal reserve board the absolute need for the congress to revise the structure that results from passage in 1913 by the congress of the federal reserve act of 1913 and the resolutions in which i am calling for the impeachment of the chairman of the federal reserve mr paul volcker as well as the supplementary resolution that equally calls for the impeachment of the open market committee which means the board plus the five private bankers that serve on this tremendous powerful socalled open market committee which as i guess most if not all my colleagues know is hardly open at all now i have in the past outlined the case i reported to the house that because of the reply i had received from the chairman of the committee on the judiciary to my request that my resolutions be considered seriously and his reply which i have inserted in the record and will not refer to it nowin which he indicated that for reasons pressures and numerous business pending in that committee he could not commit the committee to look into the matter in the immediate foreseeable future but that he was instructing the staff to evaluate the case i have not had any kind of response if any indeed has been forthcoming from that staff so i announced to the house that in view of the fact that i was indeed earnest and that despite some interpretations of these efforts that having no other recourse i would have to do the next best thing as the gentlemen conversant with our rules know in the case of a bill that is improperly bottled up by an arbitrary committee or chairman of a committee we have recourse to the discharge method by which if we get the required number that is half plus one of the membership to sign a discharge petition that committee is discharged of that matter and the matter is presented to the full house but in my case and for this reason i follow this route i intend to fully exercise the prerogatives under the rules of the house and under the applicable rules to this kind of resolution for it is a house resolution and therefore under the rules it is amenable to consideration by the house at the proper time and i intend to do that since that is my intention i then announced to the house that i would conduct the equivalent of a proceeding in a committee such as the judiciary of the impeachment process and ry first two statements in pursuance of that the last made about a week before the easter recess i laid the bare outlines and established the beginning of a predicate in a legislatively and legal or statutory method as to the conception the range and the applicability of article 2 section 4 of the constitution with respect to the jurisdictional coverage of that section to such officers as the federal reserve board chairman there is no question about it and i think that that is no obstacle whatsoever as a matter of fact it was insinuated in the chairmans reply to me that the chairman of the judiciary committee that he ful y appreciated the intention and thrust of my resolutions and considered it serious and worthwhile that is in other words constitutionally responsible which is fine and i am grateful for that but nevertheless i feel impelled to lay out the case so to speak so today in pursuance of what i am going to engage in that area of prime cause for my motivation in following this kind of activity or channel of action so to speak for several years as a matter of fact more than severalfirst going back to 1965 i addressed to this house to my colleagues on the banking committee a committee that i have served on for 20 yearsbetter than 20 years since i first came to the congressand addressed myself to the president at that time lyndon johnsonconcerning what was obvious to me then and that was that the factors that had for one reason or another be it war be it domestic policy or being the policies of war though undeclaredand the consequence that was apparent in the year 1965 as reflected in all of the reports the annual report of the federal reserve board unfortunately i found that even though every member particularly of the committee gets a copy of the annual report very few bother to leaf through it or look at it but that was something that i have always done since being on the committee plus my general interest in the field of fiscal and monetary policies which i consider to be the critical area as a matter of fact to personalize a bit when i first was elected to the congress during the campaign for this seatthe opposition made a big issue about the absolute need to have a guarantee no matter who won that race he would be assigned to the armed services committee because of the nature of the district and its overwhelming dependence on federal policies with respect to defensesan antonio my home base is traditionally a city that has had a stake in national defense since its founding in the days and in the times of the spanish control of that part of thiscountry it has been an outpost of defense since its very founding in 1718 and today it is one of the great pillars of our national defense composite and therefore this issue was raised politically it was a safe issue to raise by the oppolition because the democrats were in the majority the rules and the precedents of the texas delegation were rigorously based on seniority and there was a great desire for joinder to the armed services committee so those texans who had been in the congress several terms had indicated that that is exactly the post they wanted remembering that my predecessor was the ranking member of the armed services committee at the time he departed congress however since i had had some experience 5 years in the state senate of the state of texas i knew what was proper and what would be properly committed and promised and of course i never made that an issue when i got here i realized that even though the opportunity was afforded me by the then speaker of the house who told me that the president of the united states had called to ask if anything could be done to see that i would be assigned to the armed services committee i was not aware of that until the speaker called me in when he did he laid it out he said now congressuman the only way that can be done is if we find some way of enlarging that committee and if we can overcome the resistance of your own colleagues from texas who obey strict seniority he said we can strong arm we can strong muscle but i wanted to talk to you and i said no i did not come up and choose to seek this position to do anything other than to be a member of the house and legislate as a member what would follow thereafter committee assignments and the like i was perfectly content to follow the precedents and the rules and that the only time i would raise cane would be if i april j8 1982 was shortchanged or if i was discriminated against and then i told the speaker you will know what it means for me to get aroused i said i want to explain to you that i faced the same thing when i was elected to the texas state senate in 1956 like a revolution in my country and i found our great system to its everlasting glory still works and it is strictly up to you no matter what kind of committee assignment a man gets if his range of interest is in any particular field pftrticularly on the congressional level there is no reason he cannot have ample opportunity to discharge that pentup interest or that expertise he might possess no matter what his committee assignment is i want to say that because my answer to the constituents at that time since i had the honor of being immediately referred to a standing committee at that time known as the banking and currency committeeand though there were already three of us simultaneously sworn in on january 10 1962 i was the only one of the three that got assigned to a full standing committee the other two had to wait until the next congress so when i went back home i said i know that an issue had been made but i want you to know this too banking finances fiscal matters and all are one of my pet areas of interest and no matte how much you ntay think a man can do on the armed services committee or any american thinks he can do on behalf of defense if the cur rency of the nation has no value you have very little ability to fund the proper defense now that i think of those words i am struck by the appropriateness of that thinking today because that is the issue but all along when i spoke out and addressed myself to president johnson in 1965 i pointed out that it is going to be inescapable that one of two things happened soon and quickone was it was inflation or high interest rates and that our history showed us that unless specific action were taken both on the executive level as well as the congressional levelthat it was inevitable unfortunately there was no success on my part this has been the story of my careerin some cases it has taken as long as 10 years before i have had completion of an action that i initiated and so i am used to that we come to the great beauty of our system and our system is so great that if a man or a woman is right and if he has any kind of survivability that is if you can live long enough politically eventually you will be heard and if you have any kind of e lciency in presenting the cause eventually it will be considered and adopted this is the beauty of our system now of course the question is how long can you survive in this case in 1965 it was obvious to me that the soft underbelly of the american economy was showing great stress the reason was that back home i was getting messages from the local superintendents of the independent school district for example and other local political subdivisions as well as private corporations that even though in the case of the public entitles they had issued bonds for the construction of schools for the repair and recon struction and extension of such things as water mains and sewage mainsthat the sudden increase and the scarlcity of the material such as copper the labor costs had grown expedien tially that they first were finding it difficult to obtain the material what could we do up here because we had the strategic reserves at that time second what could be done to prevent a further escalation in the infla tionary pressures and labor well when i picked up the same local papers and looked at the want ads i saw huge ads almost half a page asking for carpenters electricians and skilled workers to address themselves to a number in san francisco for construction work in southeast asia well that was then the beginning of the great construction of the camranh bay which as you know was a many many millions of dollars investment on the part of our country and which tragically today is being used as a way stop base for the russian navy but at that time with these pressures the soft underside of our economic belly was being pressured my suggestion to the president was one of two things one immediately consider those measures that presidents such as roosevelt and truman had seen fit to devise particulary truman because in the case of president truman it was the most similar to that which we were entering into in vietnam it was an undeclared war in the case of world war ii of course which had a declaration of war and all that the means and the full resources and energies of the nation shoring up for one purpose and one purpose only and that was the prosecution and the winning of the war what they did was specific and as i keep on pointing out every year for 20 years when i ask the economists when i ask the chairman and the board menbers of the federal reserve board when you come here and tell me and you wring your hands and you say what is tantamount to saying that interest rates for example are acts of god that nobody can do anything about it you are overlooking history why is it then that world war ii where by 1945 46 percent of our gross national product was being used on the federal level governmental levelnaturally for the prosecution of the warand the government the taxpayer never had to pay more than 2 percent interest can you answer that not a one has bothered to try to answer it of course there are answers and there are reasons and this is what iwas getting at the same thing with president truman except that there they also used other leverages they had mild credit restraints at the proper time timing is the most important thing so that here we are today with the greatest enemy of all no russian menace no german menace of world war ii is or was ever as ominously dangerous as what our country has allowed to happen to itself mostly because the people have lost out because their government has foresaken the interest of the greatest number that is of the people for the sake of the predatory few who have existed through all time and also since the beginning of the history of our government now i have gone into that and i am not going to be repetitious other than to enlarge a little bit to go into the greater range of history and i should preface those remarks by giving credit to a man who is the author of the only book that i know of anywhere that has such a comprehensive history of interest rates in fact the title of his book is a history of interest rates and that man is mr sidney homer of new york his volume is not only eloquent it should be must reading i should say by certainly every member of the banking committee in his prefatory remarks he says this he says a spectacular rise in interest rates during the 1970s carried many longterm market rates on prime credits up to levels never before reached or approached in our time and remember he is writing as of 197677 at the latest and such a thing as 21 percent prime interest rate he has not experienced so we are talking about what he is calling high interest rates pushing toward 10 percent at that time a longer view i continue to quote provided by this history shows that recent peak yields were far above the highest prime longterm rates reported in the united states since 1800 or in england since 1700 or in holland since 1600 in other words since modern capital markets came into ex istence in the course of his book he has what i consider to be tbe most incisive and the most pertinent observation and sums up the issue that has motivated me to speak out and introduce resolutions and bills he says in another place and the never ending struggle of democracy with the rule of the elite the difference between law imposed and law accepted and that is what my resolution of impeachment of mr volcker is all about and my bills to abolish the board as it is now constituted and transfer all its functions its rules buildings its printing presses its clerks its mimeograph machines over to the department of the treasury where they will be accountable to the peopledirectly as it always had been and even halfway under the federal reserve act of 1913 until 1952 that is one of the bills but this is the issue it is the issue of power as i have said beforepower and the lack of accountability on that power no country in the history of the world has given the power that resides and has been used ruthlessly and without a counting by the federal reserve board and partiaularly since 1952 but generally since about 1923 and the beginning of such a gimmick as the open market committee because that power in essence is as mr volcker himself said less than 7 months ago when he was talking about the need for the policy that he has so sternly and in heedless disregard of the average little businessman of the average standard of living said yes of course some americans staidard of living is going to have to deteriorate well this is a matter of national policy under our constitutional form of government not to be determined by a financier who is beholden to the private banks that control the economic destinies of our country who is more sensitive to the needs of chase manhattan and first city national than he is to the president or the congress of the united states i said in the last couple of remarks that just here recently the president had a secret meeting with the chair man of the federal reserve board secret meeting can you imagine that as is these are two foreign potentates having a summit meeting here is a man that is supposed to be a public servant accounting if not to he congress certainly to the president finally being prevailed upon to condescend to walk over to the white house and have a secret meeting with the president we still do not know what if anything happened there has been a lot of scuttlebutt about there being an impasse and that mr volcker said you have still got to do more than what you have done thus far and i am not going to yield one bit in wrenching that screw one more time but who knows there is no accountability the chairman let it be known that he was there at sufferance not as a responsibility discharged but what is the federal reserve board the federal reserve board you would be surprised how many of my colleagues and the infinite number of constituents and citizens who have written to me that have been under the impression that the federal reserve board was independent autonomous as if it had sprung from the brow of a greek god and not created by the congress the federal reserve board is a creature of the congress born as a result of congressional action known as the federal reserve board act of 1913nothing else but in the meanwhile our system of economy predicated on mass production mass consumption the glory of the world which in turn and especially since world war ii has another third leg to that stool and that is consumer finance or mass financeis predicated on exactly the policies that are in opposition to what mr volcker says must be done because and even if it does and the price of it will be the deterioration in the standard of living of some americans what americans david rockefeller of chase manhatten hardly members of the congress hardly only insofar as we know we are impacted by some of the adverse situationsconstituents going broke the number of foreclosures on homeowners tripling in the last 6 months not postponement of payments not delinquencies but foreclosures mind you and as we watch our hapless small businessmen how can they finance a floor inventory by borrowing at a bank that is going to demand what they say 2 or 3 points over the going prime interest rate well what that means right now is that there is no small businessman who is going to get a line of credit for less or much less than 18 percent who in the world in any country at any time at any point in history with comparative situations can survive much less our form of economy this is what is at stake this is why i was impelled to follow and seek the quickest means to bring attention and focus concerted action it has not been forthcoming and perhaps it is one of those regretful cycles where we do not respond until catastrophe is on us the trouble with that is that usually when we act in emergency or crisis we do not react as wisely and as prudently as we ought as a matter of fact the federal reserve board act of 1913 was a result of the great panicmore than a depressionit was the panic of 1907 but going back even to the beginning of our government because this is tied in with the very existence of our government mr homer was not exaggerating when he said the never ending struggle of democracy with the rule of the elite that is what we have now we have the rule of the elite and that elite is a socalled elite banking class that now is supranational why should they worry when their powers transcend the capacity the ability and the jurisdiction of individual nations including our own even the matter of war and peace is a decision now pretty much vested in the bankers sc as i said earlier the issue is power are the people going to completely keep the power the constitution vests in them of formulating and approving the fiscal the monetary the economic policies that are going to govern our country or are the bankers going to do it that is the issue the bankers are doing it they have done it and 1 see nothing on the horizon that seems to be able to muster the help we need to break that hold other than disaster and that i certainly do not even want to think about though reality compels me to admit that there is much more likelihood of that than not and i have expounded on that as long ago as 2 years and 2 montis ago it seems fair to bay that the socalled free market longterm rates of interest for any industrial nation properly charted provide a sort of fever chart of the economic and political health of the nation i have been charting it and that is the reason why i was im pelled to communicate with the president in 1965 certainly i was not seeking some political or personal benefit this is a subject matter that has very little political mileage if anybody is interested in knowing that but when we look at the full range of history and we see that the rise and the fall of nations and empires and societies are tracked by this thing we call interest rates it seems that somehow we have all been brainwashed as to the true definition of interest rates interest rates is a mechania by which the wealth of any country or society is transferred it is as simple as that i have pointed out of course that interest rates can be controlled of course there is such a thing as manageability of course there is such a thing as the american form of government having the resources to do exactly that if in the wisdom of the congress and to a certain extent of the executive as well it sees fit to do so what i am saying is that there is no reason why it cannot be reversed and in order to bring about some procedural suggestions to focus our attention on the reforms needed and the actions that can be taken both legislatively and administratively i have introduced these resolutions and these bills when we look at the history as so dramatically presentedeven though this is not a book on grammar this history of interest rateswe find that we as modem citizens like to think that credit is a modern invention but we can go back to 1800 b c before christ and look at the code of hammurabi in ancient babylonand learn that there must have been agitating minds even then because in the code it is prescribed that the maximum amount of interest charged for example on grain deals was 33 percent on other transactions such as silver it was 20 percent now we come down through history we bounce down to about 600 b c the greek states and we find that the same thing agitated the athenians and the law of solon had to be invoked there was a crisis incurred because of war and debt and what not but we should remember that at that time interest could be paid in money as well as other things including per sonal enslavement for nonpayment the code of solon limited that what it did was it removed the limitations that had been in existence since the code of hammurabi but instead reduced and eliminated interest in many many ways but then the next were the romans in their socalled twelve tables of the law which were sort of semicustomary law and semistatutory prescribed law and there the romans had precise figures and limitations and they went down to the figure of 8 percent and quadruple damages for violations exess charges over that amount then we go down the line even then to what i think was the most interesting period up to now up to this entry and that was the middle ages where we had a period of a thousand years but even charlemagne in what was known as the capitularies of charlemagne flatly forbade any increment on loans for a thousand years in the middle ages that was the rule and it became a theological or a religious issue on usury and the wrongness of usury even in the time of jesus christ there were usury laws and control of interest we come down to the 12th century in england and we find there these peculiarities that we find today because this is the great dilemma of the history of interest rates rememberkia that like a fever chart as the author says we can chart a nations period of stress and downfall this is why i am so concerned about out country ar we know it was not until the confederacy actually went broke and could not obtain credit that they called the constitutional convention though when they did issue bills or notes they never paid more than 5 percent and when they borrowed they never paid more than 51 percent but it finally got to the point where because as we will recall under the confederacy or the articles of confederation the government had no power to tax that therefore its paper had no real redeeming virtue so it was at that juncture in 1786 when it could no longer get credit or issue notes that the need for calling the constitutional convention of 1787 became absolutely imperative this is how money ties in with the flow and ebb of political and govern mental events this is why i was in great distress 2 years after 1965 when i saw what was happening with gold at that time we had the socalled gold exchangenot the gold standard but the gold exchangeand the gold we were pouring into vietnam was ending up in france and later when mr nixon made his famous trip to china what we did not read in the papers was that the chinese would not let his plane land until we had deposited 10 million worth of gold with them ostensibly to secure the cost of all the tv apparatuses and the other things that were entailed in that sojourn of our president in china but the interesting thing for us to remember is that it was demanded in the form of gold that is convertible that is ultimately it is payable in gold or redeemable in gold these things all have their meaning not because there is any justification to returning to a gold standard or anything like thatthat is equal follybut because they are symptomatic of this other thing and that is the fact of the policies that are shaping for ex ample how much interest the government is paying i am sure that the founding fathers and every responsible leader through franklin roosevelt and harry truman are turning over in their graves even in the depths of the ground to hear rumors that the government is paying almost as much as 15 percent on longterm notes that is incredible a 21vpercent prime interest rate incredible and we have our president piously proclaiming on radio last saturday that oh we should not be paying more than 10 percent well why 10 percent why not 6 percent since when are we going to be so grateful that is like saying oh hit us on the head again because it feels so good when you stop it is ridiculous and it has never ceased to amaze me how with such complacency we have accepted the loss of the power of determining the policies of economics of fiscal policy and monetary policy and without a whimper and how oblivious we are to the implications of this and how much we have lost in the way of time to be able to redeem even partially what has happened there is no way that the businesses that have been forced out of business just in the last 60 days can be revived even if interest rates were to drop to 6 percent today there is no way that this economy is going to be turned around at all even if interest rates were to drop in the next 3 months to 10 percent there is no way that before the end of this year there would be any impact at all but what is tragic is that in the meanwhile we have had such a maladjustment in the functional ability of this intricate economy known as the american economy and this should have been apparent to us with the folly of the 1971 economic stabilization act wage and xirice controls and incidentally even then on that issue we were a lost voice in the wilderness as members know i am labeled a liberal and i am proud of that designation if it is interpreted like i have always interpreted it in the american sense but there were a few of us5 of us and we were alonewho resisted tlat effort in the committee and there wore about 17 in the full house and the reasons we gave of course were just about as listened to as what we have been saying here in the last few months that perhaps is neither here nor there and we return to the fundamental question and that is what should we do to have accountability at least if we cannot have the return of this usurped power why can we not have some measure of accountability from these money managers why cannot the congress act that has been my question it seems to me that it is not a question just of this board and this chairman it has been a question that has been raised since 1963 after the visit of the then secretary of the treasury mr dillon who incidentally was supposed to be a great financial wizard but actually really was not except in one category and that was knowledgeability of the bond market in new york and the speculative market there the truth is that since i have been in the congress and on this committee for 20 years i have never yet had any member of the federal reserve board much less the chairman come to the congress and give us an ac counting of the reason for policies or an explanation of the mechanism and the system used in judgment making an evaluative explanation of making judgments on these critical issues because they are the ones who are saying that if you want to buy a car you pay 16 percent interest i notice there was a lot of hulabaloo recently because a few small bankers in california decided that they could go as low as 12 percent an average american family today even with the socalled decline of inflation knows better knows that when he goes to the market or the housewife goes to that market her grocery bill is not less and the items she has to have have not been reduced i have good testimony as of last saturday from my own wife but when it comes to a car remembering that that is our prime product we like to laugh at some of our countries to the south of us as onecrop economies banana countries coffee countries sugar countries but we are pretty much the same way the automobile industry is our basic if anyone does not believe that go try to tell the quarter of a million unemployed and the ripple effect of that unemployment in the northeast in the central midwest in ohio and illinois pennsylvania new york michigan because first the cars that are made are not being sold how can the average american at 16 percent afford to even if he could get the downpayment how can the small average businessman first get a line of credit from a bank even at 16 perceit longterm mortgages 17 percent if somebody is able to find an assumable longterm mortgage april r8 1982 ironically as in the case of interest rates we are going right now in that respect in that sector of our economy we are exactly where we were in 1929 5percent balloon notes no longterm financing which is exactly the point we have reached now these are not things that are caused by accident and let me hasten to pursue one further matter they are not caused either by socalled profligate government which has not been profligate it is not caused as the economists now are expressing puzzlement the secretary of the treasury regan said about 2 weeks ago that he was completely mystified he could not understand why this intractability in the persistence of high interest rates because they were supposed to with the reduction in budgetary outlays and with the other concommitants of a reduction in inflation rates supposed to have gone down he is not the only one puzzled even some of the preeminent economists but the truth is if we do not understand the true cause and the true nature of the forbes that lead to the condition how in the world can we ever arrive at a solution to the matter it is impossible this is ekactly what i think has been the case in and out of the congress essentially we cannot have it both ways the federal reserve cannot have it both ways on the one hand they want to assume and take credit for fighting inflation through a restrictive tight money policy on the other hand they say their hands are tied because the prime cause of that inflation is the insufficient and inadequate reduction in the budgetary side of the governments activity they cannot have it both ways either they are able to and have the power or they do not on the other hand they resist any kind of inquiry from the congress fifteen years ago i requested gao to try to find out for me what resources the federal reserve board had for selfpolicing did they have an inspector general who did they account for other than a socalled internal audit the gao the general accounting office which is the only instrumentality the congress has amenable to it replied that they were not empowered to look into the federal reserve board so that i joined at that time with the distinguished chairman of the banking committee my fellow texan mr patman one of the greatest americans who has served in this house in a bill that would bring in the gao and you would have thought that we had introduced the equivalent of a resolution of an act of treason and naturally never could get it considered the bankers there is not a bill i have known of particularly those that mr patman was trying to sponsor in 1965 in anticipation of the stress in our financial and banking system that was beginning to be visible the failure of some banks and the like and so he tried to get the administration house administration committee to budget a modest amount so that he could get the staff to look into such things as interlocking directorates now of course that is out of control you have these massive mergers and acquisitions where you have more than interlocking controls you have now fewer people controlling a greater mass of our economic activity in the country mr patman was trying to get at the interlocking relationships and banks some of the monopolistic corporations some of the key pricefixing pricedetermining monopolies in our country and he never succeeded in fact he was abused and fought bitterly here and back home politically and we never succeeded in even getting approval on the committee level because i have not seen any of those bills and especially if a powerful body such as the american banking association is against any of these measures my experience and observation in 20 years is it is not about to be approved by the congress or the committee that sounds harsh but that is my observation based on 20 years of membership on the banking finance and urban affairs committee as it is now known of the house of representatives the federal reserve board is actually the private commercial banking system of the country it is not a public entity in that sense so you have the fox so to speak watching the henhouse about the only discretion we can hope he will have is how may chickens that fox decides to eat up per night and when it suddenly gets voracious and uncontrolled well then should we be pained should we be surprised if what we call the american way or standard of living is collapsing and in danger with that question i will yield with the

obligated for the procurement of poorly conceived and expensive weapons systems before the complete examination of critical factors is undertaken in fiscal year 1982 the department of defense has been authorized to spend over 36 billion for the procurement of military hardware or 9 billion more than during the last fiscal year yet at the same time that unprecedented increases in defense spending are being enacted into law the impact of the procurement of many weapons systems on inflation on local communities on the environment and on the strategic balance have yet to be determnined take the mx missile for example after years of congressionally approved spending on research development and initial procurement no decision has been reached on the appropriate basing mode and now doubts are being cast over the strategic implications of deploying such a system had our military planners been more attentive to the problems that we now know are associated with the 1= it is conceivable that the pentagon could have considered other options and the expected cost overruns on the mx could have been avoided the department of defense does not however need just another study if our nations defense planners and the american people are to truly benefit from a coherent defense strategy then input ought to be obtained from the broadcast possible sources is it not conceivable that academics environmental groups business roundtables economic analysts and even the mechanics who must repair and maintain military equipmentas well as pentagon officials and traditional defense contractorscould be consulted about major weapons systems under consideration by the department of defense at a time of increased defense spending and fiscal restraint the american people must be doubly careful about waste weapons systems like other government expenditures must be developed along the most costeffective lines no stone must be left unturned in the search for the least wasteful least damaging to the environment safest surest alternatives to maintaining an adequate defense for the nation our adversaries will not change their perceptions about american military resolve if the united states adopts a

overwhelmingly supported the provisions appearing in title vii these provisions are the final product of the full committee on agriculture and also represent compromises needed to address budgetary constraints the peanut provisions of h r 3603 are basically extensions of changes made in the program 4 years ago in the 1977 farm bill the peanut portion of the 1977 farm bill maintained the acreage allotment feature of the previous program but introduced a twotiered price support loan programone level for peanuts produced within the limits of a farm poundage marketing quota and a lower level for peanuts produced in excess of the marketing quota but planted within the farms acreage allotment changes implemented by the 1977 act have resulted in a reduction in outlays from the federal government assured unitedstates consumers reliable and abundant supplies of quality peanut products at reasonable prices provided minimum income protection to the nations peanut farmers and given growers new opportunities to produce peanuts for export or crushing at competitive world prices h r 3603 proposes to continue to provide benefits resulting from the 1977 act with modifications in the program designed to further strengthen the unitedstates agricultural economy and further limit the exposure of the unitedstates treasury section 702 maintains the national acreage allotment and poundage quota programs the national allotment and quota are divided among the producers based on historical production patterns these two programs work together to attempt to insure an adequate supply of high quality peanuts and at the same time gives the department of agriculture some measure to estimate costs associated with the operation of the price support program because i~n allotnient must be planted on a regular basis to be maintained and because the total allotment may be adjusted by the secretary to reflect demand the united states has benefited from a stable supply of peanuts despite the fact that farmers in this country possess the ability to vastly overproduce for the domestic peanut market production has remained generally in line with need thus avoiding disastrously low prices for farmers while assuring consumers of a constant supply of peanuts and peanut products at reasonable prices the 1980 drought has resulted in the first shortage of peanuts in 25 years recent increases in consumer prices for peanut products were caused by the drought that devastated 42 percent of the crop not by the peanut price support program as my colleagues know whenever there is a critical shortage of a commodity prices of that commodity tend to rise the 1981 crop of peanuts is being harvested now and it appears that by the end of october there will be an adequate supply of peanuts available for domestic and export needs the peanut industrys quality control is tied directly into the peanut allotment system peanuts are the only major american food commodity that is marketed under a voluntary but very strict quality assurance program providing unitedstates consumers with the highest quality peanuts in the world marketing supervision provided through the allotment and price support program is a vital link in the food quality control chain the need for poundage quota authority was recognized in the 1977 farm bill and this legislation would continue that authority in order to help match production with demand and thus control program costs the national minimum poundage quota contained in the 1977 act ranged from 1 680 000 tons in 1978 to 1 440 000 tons in 1981 under the poundage quota reduction that began under the 1977 act peanut program costs have declined dramaticall1y the reduction to 1 3 million acres provided in this bill will continue to k~eep production in balance with domestic need and will reduce program costs still further the 1977 farm bill set the minimum price support loan rate for quota peanuts at 420 per ton during the 4year life of the act the loan rate has risen to only 455 per ton where it remains for the 1981 crop this level does not take account of the sharp increases in production costs for that reason section 707 proposes to set the minimum support level at 600 per ton for the 1982 crop of quota peanuts which are peanuts grown within the farmers individual poundage quota with changes for the 198385 crops reflecting future changes in production costs not including changes in land costs the bill also provides price support loans for additional peanuts those in excess of the farmers quota but grown on the alloted acres at a level to be determined by the secretary that will insure no losses to the commodity credit corporation on the sale of additional peanuts the department of agriculture estimates the cost of the peanut program will be 80 million for the next 4 years as we have heard throughout this debate americas farmers are in financial crisis let us~ give them the support necessary to keep them on the job of producing food and fiber for this country and the world the administration supports the peanut provisions contained in this bill i urge my colleagues to support the language the

extremely important precedent that i hope will be followed in subsequent years i would also like to point out especially for the members on my side of the aisle that the measure that came before the full judiciary committee was approximately 70 million above the budget recommendation originally made by the administration in the full committee meeting i offered an amendment to reduce the authorization by 35 million it is almost unprecedented for a republican to offer an amendment to reduce the authorization by 35 million and then have it supported unanimously on both sides of the aisle by a voice vote i want the members to know that what we are bringing here is in my view a barebones authorizationa spartan budgetwhich is something that i think our committee always brings before this body the committee on the judiciary devoted a substantial amount of time and effort to produce the bill which we are considering today first individual subcommittees considered and made recommendations on matters within their respective jurisdictions the monopolies and commercial law subcommittee marked up the original version of the bill based on those recommendations when the full committee considered this bill we made every effort to cut authorized appropriations to an acceptable minimum this was a particularly difficult task because the comnittee in the past has not authorized appropriations for the department at luxury levels the committee adopted by amendment which included the administrations figures except in a few areas experiencing pressing needs thus we added some modest amounts for the immigration and naturalization service to which the chairman has made appropriate reference we added 3 million for the unitedstates marshals for service of civil process in which i believe the administration concurs finally we restored funds for bankruptcy trustees which is consistent with the bankruptcy reform law we that passed in 1978 another amendment offered by the chairman of the subcommittee on crime with the support of the ranking minority member the gentleman from michigan made a slight increase in authorized funds for the drug enforcement administration let me emphasize that these were all increases which received substantial bipartisan support most of the increases over the administrations figures contained in my amendment relate to the immigration and naturalization service that is about 25 million as a member of the select commission on immigration which recently submitted its final report to the president and to the congress i

difficult problems that the president himself has identified on more than one occasion indeed i believe the presidents announcement which will come to us in just a few days will be consistent with the action that the judiciary committee has taken in recommending the figure that we have in the department of justice authorization bill but legislative changes are not sufficient we must also adequately staff the immigration and naturalization service which bears the substantial burden of enforcing our immigration laws if we are to have any impact this is particularly true with respect to the crucial role played by the border patrol for which we are authorizing the restoration of positions that were not filled by the last administration one amendment adopted by the committee makes a modest increase in authorized appropriations for dea as we are all aware drugs constitute an inextricable part of the overall problem of violent crime in this country the amendment which our committee adopted would provide funds primarily in the areas of coordination with state and local law enforcement agencies such cooperation is vital if we are to effectively combat the drug problem and i support this increase again i believe that our committee has produced an authorization bill for the department which achieves an appropriate balance between effective law enforcement and spending

insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act amendments of 1982 these amendments to fifra are not without controversy but i have every confidence that members in debating the issues will be able to resolve the controversial matters and produce a piece of legislation thait can be signed into law by the president in that regard i am sure there are members in this chamber who may have been advised that the administration may well oppose house passage of h r 5203 unless it is amended to delete section 11 of the bill which deals with the authority of states and amends the authorization to reduce funding for epa i have pot seen a signed letter from the administration indicating a final administration position and i should like to state that although i was told the administration opposed this provision on the day that the rules committee considered the request for a rule i have since learned that the matter is still under active review at the office of management and budget and so it would be my recommendation that we proceed in an orderly fashion to consider the merits of this legislation and at a later time we can expect to hear from the administration on its position on the bill i will not take further time to explain the various features of this legislation leaving that task to be dealt with when the general debate takes place i would urge adoption of this rule so that we may

governments subsidizing the tobacco industry i rise in favor of the amendment offered by the gentleman from ohio and commend his offering it at a time when we are seeking cutbacks in so many areas it would be inappropriate and unfair to overlook the agricultural industry as a possible source of savings certainly tobacco production is one activity from which we can withdraw our support and reduce federal expenditures substantially it is my feeling that our support of tobacco productionand of other crops as wellhas been unjustified and unnecessary the governments regulating the amount of acreage which may be planted and purchasing any surplus crop after commercial buyers have bought the amount they desire is clearly an intrusion in the marketplace not only does such a policy unfairly increase profits for the producer but it also does so at the expense of consumers with the use of their tax dollars to finance the program and through theinflated prices which are a result of the controlled supply of the product in addition the tobacco subsidy is a subsidy of a product which poses a severe public health threat no one can deny the inconsistency of the governments support of a product the use of which it is trying to discourage through campaigns aimed at discouraging smoking and increasing the awareness of the importance of good health i am pleased to support the gentlemans

going to vote there is a serious budget problem that is involved with this amendment this amendment would provide for 57 v million to be paid but the language of the amendment says shall be eligible

be a new entitlement it has to be within the ceilings established by the committees the committee in this case has not established a new entitlement to allow for this 57 million therefore under section 305 of the budget resolution the entire resolution would be held at the desk as required by 302 and would not be passed because there is no entitlement that allows for this provision members

me just make three quick points our chairman of the full committee the gentleman from mississippi was very articulate in his reading of a sentence from the court decision let me repeat the words that he used he said we are extremely reluctant to interfere with the construction of a projec t that congress has authorized for the last 10 years and that is now 55 percent complete that is a quote out of the conclusion of the court decision the problem is that the gentleman did not read what follows which begins but the plaintiffs have established that the corps has blatantly violated nepa and its own regulations by refusing to prepare a supplemental eis on the major changes in the tennesseetombigbee waterway that have occurred since 1971 any lay person looking at a list of these changes would at once perceive that such major alterations could have significant environmental impacts all the expert testimony offered by the parties has confirmed that lay judgment and the corps has been at an utter loss for evidence to justify its refusal to file a supplemental eis if the limited injunctive relief we have imposed seems harsh or late the fault lies with the decision of the corps to ignore its responsibility and to resist this lawsuit while continuing its default i think that clarifies the courts conclusion and i invite members to see the total statement that was made by the court the second summary point i would like to make is that in 1980last yearthe fiscal request and budget appropriation was 246 million for this project in 1981 this present fiscal year we are spending 220 million on this project and in these 3 years of fiscal constraint fiscal year 1980 fiscal year 1981 and now in 1982 the total cost over 3 years will be 655 million let me just share with my colleagues the fact that if we combined all of the money for corps of engi neers water projects that we are spending in ohio maryland new york west virginia florida indiana kansas iowa montana colorado and arizona and added up the total amount of money spent in all of those states you would not come to the figure that is being appropriated 189 million for this legislation this is my final point my colleague the gentleman from washington has a good amendment there will be a followon amendment offered but this amendment i think is the one we ought to support there is money in the pipeline to shut down the project there are usable sections of the project from columbus down there is opportunity to resell some of the land and particularly there is opportunity to pause and wait and see where the court decision takes us to determine what the final aspects of this particular project are but i would argue very strongly with my colleagues that if we do live in a time of limited federal dollars and if we do live in a period of time when we have to be in great restraint in the use of those federal dollars we ought to question any project in which if we cut 100 million out of it we would still be spending more money on that project than all other projects in the nation i think it is the responsibility of this congress which has set the tone for cutting federal spending to cut this project and move on and serve the nation in constructing those needed water projects throughout the country that have merit and are clearly more justified than the project that has been laid out before us"]]}
