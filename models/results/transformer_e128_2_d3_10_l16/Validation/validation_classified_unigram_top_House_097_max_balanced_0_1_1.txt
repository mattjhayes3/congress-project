emphasis on cutting taxes i really believe that the votes we are going to cast next tuesday and wednesday on the various substitutes to the budget resolution may well be the most important votes we will cast in this congress i would like to explain why this first budget resolution sets these aggregate target levels for spending and for revenues although technically they my well not be binding lthe point ils the committee on ways and means on which i serve is not going to cut taxes any less than or any more than is allowed by this budget resolution and most certainly not any more than this level therefore if we adopt a budget resolution that does not allow any cut in taxes there will not be any or if we adopt a budget resolution like the budget committee has put forward that allows less of a tax cut then we are seeking in the orammlatta substitute then we are going to be bound by those terms as well so as a practical matter the committee on ways and means is not going to send a tax cut bill to the floor that cuts taxes any more than this first budget resolution will allow as a theoretical matter tha~t is really the way it ought to be i agree with the chairman of the budget committee in this regard if the budget process means anything this first budget resolution ought to mean something in the past in the four terms i have been in thishouse i have seen time and time again passage of budget resolutions without their meaning anything nobody paid any attention whatsoever to those figures we really ought to if the budget process is going to mean anything as a practical matter we will as far as the committee on ways and means is concenied therefore this is why i say these votes on substitutes and the resolution next tuesday and wednesday are really going to be the most important votes we cast in this congress the most important issue facing this congress is that of the economy the most important votes we are going to have occur on whether or not we are going to implemhent a program the president of the united states has presented to the congress for economic recovery therefore if we wing or injure or handicap or cripple what we are going to be able to subsequently do in the area of tax cuts in part~icular by this budget resolution then we are in effecting winging or handicapping this economic program one of the four parts of the economic recovery program of the president is a sound tax cut program l this tax cut programs life depends upon this budget resolution we are going to adopt basically if we look at what we are hearing in the committee on ways and means i agree wholeheartily with the president of thie united states that we must have a responsible and substantive tax cut program to help solve our economic problems one of the real problems we are having today is that of productivity last year the productivity of the united states was almost dead last when compared to other major industrial nations and for the first time in recent history productivity in this country did not go up it actually declined in 1980 when you have declining productivity your efficiency is going down the ability to produce goods and services is going down in terms of competition with foreign count~ries and in terms of any kind of real growth in this country which means inflation as it costs more to produce something that is inflation as you produce less of something in comparison to foreign competition that is inflation an ople work less hard because there is no incentive because you are not taking home any more money because of high tax rates that is inflation so basically what we believe land strongly believe is that the only real way we can address this problem of productivity is to cut taxes in a meaningful way to cut taxes to make it possible to improve productivity now we do that in this fashion the reason we have to cut these taxes is to mak~e capital available i think everybody understands that the way you retool or modernize a factory the way you have a plant expand and the way to create jobs and the way you are able to keep up with japanese competition in steel and automobiles is to spend money or capital on these factories and these plants where does this capital come from you cannot expect businesses and individuals today to borrow money not at 15 percent and the prime rate continuing to climb as a matter of fact the amount of money american business is borrowing is unhealthy they ought to be generating that capital in aftertax income we oughtto be encouraging individuals to invest money and this is not true under the current tax situation we have in this country so basically if we cut tax rates we generate capital rm aing with the individual who can tnivest money received in a tax cut and put it back i the depository institutions in this country where we need it to lower interest rates we let business have additional profits after their taxes as they will be able to plow capital back into their businesses to retool and modernize there is a new wrinkle we ought to think about too as we reduce the individual tax burden we are letting the taxpayer see he has more after tax income than before and just maybe he will work a little bit harder how many people do we know now who take off a full days work because they are paying too much in taxes in my part of the country a lot of folks will take off for deer hunting season and not work for a month or two because it costs too much to werk they can make almost as much on food stamps and unemployment compensation as they can working and paying taxes as long as we h ave that kind of situation existing in this country we are going to have iflation and low productivity we have to make it possible for people to make more money and keep more of what they earn the same thing is true of the business community to be able to invest that capital to be able to retool modernize our industrial base to keep up with the japanese and germans and to also be able to have people see it pays more to work than it does to play so we have to have capital to solve our problems of productivity and productivity is one of the biggest solutions to our problem of inflation in the year 1980 according to an artide i read the other day in my home town newspaper taxes on a family making about 30 000 a year a family of four went up 25 percent by virtue of their federal tax burdensin 1 year 25 percent in 1965 only 7 percent of all of our taxpayers paid the marginal tax rate of more than 25 percent by 1977 that figure had grown from 7 percent to 30 percent of the american people who were paying more than this because of bracket creep and because of tax increase~s these dual perils are continuing to push more and miore of our taxpayers into higher tax brackets with no more real income to spend by virtue of inflation and these tax increases individuals need a tax break in this country they need it to be able to work harder they need it to be able to make ends meet and they need it out of a spirit of fairness but what i am contending goes beyond that we must have these tax cuts to actually make it possible for our economy to grow and to expand and to hire more people and take care of the people in this country who are less fortunate and have no opportuni ties as the gentleman spoke so eloquently about a mioment ago now if we look at what we have to vote on next tuesday and wednesd~ay in light of the need for tax cuts this might color our final decision first of all we have the substitute by the gentleman

president who brought a vigorous new approach to the solutions of the problems confronting this nation and the world by their votes the people of this nation indicated they wanted a change in direction and this president offered a change he promised to try and reduce federal spending he promised to try to cut the destructive high inflation rate he promised to reduce the unwarranted and unnecessary federal interference in our daily lives with the help in some cases reluctant help of the 535 members of congress this president has made a new beginning he was not able to reduce federal spending but he did cut my more than half the request for increased federal spending he was not able to eliminate all the unnecessary redtape but he was able to reduce the number of pages of regulations printed in the federal register from 73 000 to 51 000 he was not able to end inflation but he did cut the rate which had been in double digit figures for most of the previous administration down to an annualized rate in the month of march of less than 4 percent for the past 5 or 6 months we have been provided with a consistent diet of bad news the morning newspaper headlines and the evening television news emphasize what they perceive to be wrong with the presidents program and ignore what many common folk perceive to be right with the presidents program nowhere has this consistent criticism of the reagan administration been more pernicious than it has been in the reports of central and latin america and particularly the reports from el salvador now i call your attention to some good news and to underscore the importance of this good news permit me to review in some detail what has been going on in el salvador mr speaker in land area this nation is about the size of your own state of massachusetts it is bordered by guatemala on the north honduras on the east and nicaragua on the southeast with about 135 miles of frontage on the pacific ocean about 5 million people live in el salvador el salvador became independent of spain in 1821 and of the central american federation in 1841 about 10 percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and different attitude toward the role of the federal government in our everyday lives is a remarkable change we spent billions to create the great society and are we better off for all that public money spent the crime rate in evcry category is up we spent billions of public money in the war on poverty there is still great misery and poverty in this country the reagan administration understands that you cannot give somebody something without ultimately destroying the recipient of your gift the reagan administration is determined to get the government out of the way and to encourage the individuals to be responsible for their own destiny with an assist for all those who are genuinely incapable of caring for themselves as i go about the 4th district in arizona i find the people expressing new confidence and new hope sure things are difficult right now they say but it is

2year period there can be little argument that a 25percent reduction is superior to a 15percent reduction but what does it mean to our several and individual states i show you a reagan tax cut means more than has been presented here this afternoon it shows that michigan will have 140 million more in revenue 57 million more for indiana 127 million more for new jersey 228 million more for new york 81 million for massachusetts 88 million for illinois 120 million more for ohio 110 million more for the state of pennsylvania i submit to you that there is not a man or woman in this house who would not be interested in voting for a measure that would give a grant of these kinds of money to the several states the difference in this measure the difference in the reagan proposal is that these

affairs committee by voice vote on october 5 recommended that the house adopt h r 4603 as amended responding to the request of the independent regulators and insurers of our financial institutions after a thorough consideration of the regulators request the committee concluded that simple prudence demands that we provide our regulators with maximum flexibility in the administration of existing deposit insurance funds to minimize impact on these funds and at the same time provide maximum assistance based upon the circumstances involved in each case to those institutions primarily thrift institutions experiencing declining net worth problems during this period of extreme financial stress largely due to persistent doubledigit inflation h r 4603 as amended by the committee provides for increased flexibility in the administration of existing deposit insurance funds for the provision of transitional assistance to thrift institutions during this period of financial stress and for broadened merger possibilities designed to minimize the cost impact on the individual insurance funds while at the same time assisting the maximum number of institutions these changes affect the federal deposit insurance corporation the federal home loan bank board and its federal savings and loan insurance corporation and the national credit union administration and its national credit union

the events leading up to the committees favorable action by voice vote on october 6 will be of interest to the house well over 1 year ago the committee leadership began meeting with regulators individually and collectively as it became increasingly apparent that thrift institutions with their lowyield portfolios and sustained high borrowing costs were experiencing rapidly declining net worth problems and that simple prudence dictated that a workable contingency plan be adopted should the economic situation hold constant or even worsen as has been the case the regulators at the request of the committee leadership were encouraged to prepare concensus draft legislation which was done this draft legislation was discussed by members and staff thoroughly at numerous meetings beginning last spring the legislation before you today h r 4603 remains essentially the bill which was drafted by the regulators during this period numerous meetings were held as well with representatives of the administration primarily department of treasury officials and the economic council to assist my colleagues in attempting to understand the administrations position on the provisions of h r 4603 which has and continues to cause confusion i want to place in the record thei exchange of correspondence which took place with the department of treasury several committee

rates have been at intolerably high doubledigit levels as a result mutual savings bsnks and savings and loan associations and some banks and credit unions are suffering serious reductions in their ability to extend needed credit to important sectors of our nations economy their financial soundness may also be falling into jeopardy it is this aspect of the conduct of monetary policy that will be explored in todays hearing the iirst of several by the house committee on banking finance and urban affairs in its semidannual monetary policy hearings held pursuant to the full employment and

occasion for us here in the congress for the committee on agriculture and the house of representives and indeed for the american people as we discuss h r 3603 the agriculture and food act of 1981 i support with amendments that will be offered later this legislation because we need in the interest of the entire nation and indeed of the world stability in the agricultural sector just this morning in one of the newspapers in this capitol i read a report from lester brown one of the renowned researchers and experts in the field of world food resources where he stated that the population of the world which will increase around the turn of the century to over 4 billion people could not be sustained materially in the manner in which it is not being sustained nutritionally unless we have more productivity and that perhaps that productivity is indeed limited due to the lack of fertile lands or arable lands and that the bulk of them are now under production second let me say that there are some members in this house who oppose either parts of this legislation or the whole i could not fathom anybody opposing this legislation for one simple reasonless than 3 percent of the population of the united states provides all of the food and fiber for the entire population of the united states and enough to export to bring precious income back to our countrythat 225plus million people are fed by less than 3 million further and i think this is worthwhile for all of those who may listen or may read the recordit should be noted that the people in the united states of course there are always exceptionsevery rule has an exceptionand someone might quote us the exception but in general the people of the united states today are the best fed people in the world in the history of the world and they buy the best quality food in the world in the history of the world for the smallest part of their disposable income it takes less of their income to buy the food which they need to sustain themselves than in any other country in the world in the history of the world to get the food that they need there will always of course be the exception the american housewife or homemaker can get meat for example if she wants beef if she wants mutton if she wants ham shecp goat poultry whatever she wants she can get whole or frozen or fresh or cut up all you have to do is to go to the supermarkets and to the grocery stores and it is there available for a lower price a lower part of disposable income than for all of the people in the rest of the world the housewife can get the fruits the vegetables and of course in this legislation we do not deal with fruits and vegetables but our farmers still produce those items the best quality for the american people now why the need for the legislation because sources or items or factors beyond the control of the farmer have forced his cost of production to the limitmany times beyond what he sells his product for the cost of fuel the imposition by the government of restrictions or limitations what kind of pesticides what kind of insecticides how mlich he has to pay his farmworkers not that he begrudges thisand indeed the farmwvorker probably is the lowest paid of all of the workers of americabut yet that farmworkers contribute more i say respectfully than any other worker in america because he works for less unfortunately but helps provide the food that is necjessary to sustain this great nation and our people because of these deficiencies government has to intervene and we have this program which is meager assistance at best a safety net if one calls it thatand we are not speaking here of a hammock someone can go out and take a siesta on we are speaking of a safety net that you see in the circus the last thing that will break your fall before you fall to the ground and break all the bones in your body as you see with the aerialists in the circus this is what we are trying to do for the american farmer there are american farms collapsing by the day there are american dairymen shutting down their operations there are young people closing down their farms and i listened to lester brown saying we will not be able to feed all the people in the world so this is a very small modest effort to assist that productivity and meet our responsibility as a congress and a nation and as a people to that less than 3 percent who provide the food and fiber for all of us there are various and sundry parts of this bill which i would not detail to the members but rather will be available to read in the record but i say very respectfully that the line should be forming behind us to support us to provide this very very modest assistance to those who provide the food and fiber now the members will hear later aljout othe amendments the bill that passed the committee is beyond the budget resolution but we have a consensus amendment from the comimittee and outside the committee that wvill be offered by the gentleman from iowa that will bring our bill in line or below the budget imposed upon us by the budget committee we will bring our bill below the budget for fiscal year 1982 as instructed by the committee so i would hope that the members who are not here would read the recoiw for when we resume our deliberations next week those who oppose sections of this bill should realize again that it may be popular to say well it will increase the price of sugar it wvill increase the price of wheat for bread it will increase the price to the consumer out there in the marketplace it may wellin very very small areas but it is either that or like in many other countries in the wvorld that we have been reading of lately getting in line and waiting at the grocery store only not to have food available we really do not know what it is not to have it available i daresay all of us here had lunch no one told us how much we could order for that lunch no one told us wvhat the ration would be that is what we are trying to continue and to do so we have to offer a very modest fornm of legislative or government assistance to those who put that food on our table to those who put that food on our table for the lowest amount of disposable income than for any other people in the worldin the history of the world i would add that we need an effective government farm program because american agriculture is in deep economic trouble today without our action to continue a fair safety net farm support program that trouble will get worse and that would be the worst kind of bad news for american consumers depression in agriculture can weaken the ability of american farmers to provide us all with ample supplies of food and fiber at reasonable prices the fact that farmers are in trouble today is no news to those of us who follow agriculture closely but for those who do not let me recall for you the report issued by the department of agriculture just a few days ago that report said prices paid to farmers fell 2 2 percent in september that decline left the farmers purchasing power at the lowest level since april 1933 according to the report farm prices were down to just 59 percent of parity in september the lowest since april 1933 when the figure was 54 percent just 1 year ago farm prices were at 68 percent of parity compared with the 59 percent we got last month looking ahead we do not see much official optimism h 6879 octobcr 2 1981 an agriculture department expert was quoted thursday as predicing some continued weakness in prices this month unless there is an unexpected surge in exports or a sudden turn for the worse in harvest prospects government analysts have predicted that net farm income for 1981 which was formerly expected to show some improvement may be down around last years very poor level ini fact if we consider cash income without inventory changes 1981 could be even worse than the very bad year we had in 1980 many of my colleagues may have noted the feature story on this issue in thursdays wall street journal that story pointed out that inflation high interest rates and even the strength of the dollar overseas are combining with a growing grain surplus to batter the farm economy the story points out that wheat prices are down 7 percent from a year ago corn down 23 percent and soybeans off 19 percent the story adds that in this farm recession unlike some of those in the past we have some new problems producers generally unlike situations in that past cannot recoup their present losses on crops from offsetting profits on livestock this time livestock prices are so weak that there is only marginal profit in pork and continued losses in cattle the journal says this account also underlines the tremendous squeeze farmers face because of continued high interest rates one iowa farmer reports that a fewv years ago his interest cost on money borrowed to finance a steer was about 21 today the interest on that one feeder is about 120about the cost of feeding the steer the journal story quotes one private economist as saying that unless some unforeseen event rescues farmers in the near future many will be pushed over the brink and into depression secretary block in recent testimony before a subcommittee of the joint economic committee had this to say the farm balance sheet for this year is equally bleak farm asset values are up 8 4 percent but farm liabilities are up some 14 7 percent from last year due primarily to the increasing cost of borrowing financing for land purchases and operations also the secretary said he thinks hardly any farmers can make money when they pay 20 percent interest rates the secretary is perfectly right and this is part of our problem i do not know how accurate the forecasts are but i am convinced that farmers are facing a really critical period over the next few years that is why we mustfor the protection of the entire nationmaintain a farm program which gives producers at least a fighting chance to win their way back to a sound economy we understand the budget problems facing all legislation in this congress we understand fully that agriculture is going to absoi b its share of the cuts which must bc made to rebuild the nations economy but we must also understand that if we permit agriculture to continue sliding into depression farmers will not be the only victims in the long run a depressed agriculture is the worst kind of bad news for consumers because a depressed agriculture loses the ability to give consumers what they need mostan ample and stable food and fiber supply at reasonable prices i will not take your time to describ e in detail the provisions of h r 3603 i will include for the record a summary of those provisions suffice it to say here that it revises and extends for another 4 years price support and related programs for most of the major farm commodities it likewise extends the export assistance provisions of public law 480 it reauthorizes and places caps on appropriations for the food stamp program for 4 more years and provides the tools to conduict that program in a manner which keeps hunger from the needy and eliminates the greedy it improves and renews provisions relating to agricultural research extension and teaching and in no small measure it comes to grips with threats to one of the most precious elements of our national heritagefertile productive agricultural landwhich is increasingly endangered by erosion and conversion to a host of nonagricultural uses hl r 3603 is by no means a fat or flabby bill its provisions reflect the best judgment of the agriculture committee as to the minimal levels of protection necessary to permit american agriculture to continue the role it has so admirably filled in supplying adequate quantities of food and fiber at reasonable cost to the consumers of the nation while at the same time meeting the heavy demands of the world for agricultural commodities many of the provisions represent the only real safety net for farmers who are caught in the increasingly severe squeeze bietween declining prices and everincreasing costs it is true however that the bill as reported will for fiscal year 1982 result in costs exceeding the limits prescribed in the first concurrent budget resolution however amendments will be offered by a member of the committee to bring its costs within those limits they will deal with the dairy price support provisions and several other sections of the bill i would pause to point out that the agriculture committee has been one of the most diligent committees of the congress in practicing budgetary restraint for example last spring it reported out one of the first significant mea sures adopted by this session of the congress to reduce federal expenditures by eliminating a scheduled increase in dairy support levels this action was estimated to have saved a total of 246 million in outlays in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 the committee performed in a similar fashion during the reconciliation process measures agreed to in conference with our senate counterparts resulted in savings of a total of 2 7 billion over and above those called for by the reconciliation provisions of the first budget resolution in this regard i will offer amendments to h r 3603 which will delete provisions already disposed of by the reconciliation act or other legislation we assure you that we fully intend again to take the responsible course during the consideration of h r 3603 but we do not intend to deprive amerclan farmers of the minimal protection they need to permit them to survive the vagarics over wvhich they have no controlthe weather disaster inflation and crushing interest rates and we miust act to preserve the very basis for our botjntythe land with the amendments i have referred to the bill constitutes a responsible and costeffective approach to maintaining a viable agriculture in the national interest and insuring that hunger will not stalk the needy of our land it is a bill that merits the support of the farmer as well as the consumer and i urge my colleagues to give it that support"],

change the focus of debate on this budget resolution thus far from one of emphasis on the cut in spending to one of emphasis on cutting taxes i really believe that the votes we are going to cast next tuesday and wednesday on the various substitutes to the budget resolution may well be the most important votes we will cast in this congress i would like to explain why this first budget resolution sets these aggregate target levels for spending and for revenues although technically they my well not be binding lthe point ils the committee on ways and means on which i serve is not going to cut taxes any less than or any more than is allowed by this budget resolution and most certainly not any more than this level therefore if we adopt a budget resolution that does not allow any cut in taxes there will not be any or if we adopt a budget resolution like the budget committee has put forward that allows less of a tax cut then we are seeking in the orammlatta substitute then we are going to be bound by those terms as well so as a practical matter the committee on ways and means is not going to send a tax cut bill to the floor that cuts taxes any more than this first budget resolution will allow as a theoretical matter tha~t is really the way it ought to be i agree with the chairman of the budget committee in this regard if the budget process means anything this first budget resolution ought to mean something in the past in the four terms i have been in thishouse i have seen time and time again passage of budget resolutions without their meaning anything nobody paid any attention whatsoever to those figures we really ought to if the budget process is going to mean anything as a practical matter we will as far as the committee on ways and means is concenied therefore this is why i say these votes on substitutes and the resolution next tuesday and wednesday are really going to be the most important votes we cast in this congress the most important issue facing this congress is that of the economy the most important votes we are going to have occur on whether or not we are going to implemhent a program the president of the united states has presented to the congress for economic recovery therefore if we wing or injure or handicap or cripple what we are going to be able to subsequently do in the area of tax cuts in part~icular by this budget resolution then we are in effecting winging or handicapping this economic program one of the four parts of the economic recovery program of the president is a sound tax cut program l this tax cut programs life depends upon this budget resolution we are going to adopt basically if we look at what we are hearing in the committee on ways and means i agree wholeheartily with the president of thie united states that we must have a responsible and substantive tax cut program to help solve our economic problems one of the real problems we are having today is that of productivity last year the productivity of the united states was almost dead last when compared to other major industrial nations and for the first time in recent history productivity in this country did not go up it actually declined in 1980 when you have declining productivity your efficiency is going down the ability to produce goods and services is going down in terms of competition with foreign count~ries and in terms of any kind of real growth in this country which means inflation as it costs more to produce something that is inflation as you produce less of something in comparison to foreign competition that is inflation an ople work less hard because there is no incentive because you are not taking home any more money because of high tax rates that is inflation so basically what we believe land strongly believe is that the only real way we can address this problem of productivity is to cut taxes in a meaningful way to cut taxes to make it possible to improve productivity now we do that in this fashion the reason we have to cut these taxes is to mak~e capital available i think everybody understands that the way you retool or modernize a factory the way you have a plant expand and the way to create jobs and the way you are able to keep up with japanese competition in steel and automobiles is to spend money or capital on these factories and these plants where does this capital come from you cannot expect businesses and individuals today to borrow money not at 15 percent and the prime rate continuing to climb as a matter of fact the amount of money american business is borrowing is unhealthy they ought to be generating that capital in aftertax income we oughtto be encouraging individuals to invest money and this is not true under the current tax situation we have in this country so basically if we cut tax rates we generate capital rm aing with the individual who can tnivest money received in a tax cut and put it back i the depository institutions in this country where we need it to lower interest rates we let business have additional profits after their taxes as they will be able to plow capital back into their businesses to retool and modernize there is a new wrinkle we ought to think about too as we reduce the individual tax burden we are letting the taxpayer see he has more after tax income than before and just maybe he will work a little bit harder how many people do we know now who take off a full days work because they are paying too much in taxes in my part of the country a lot of folks will take off for deer hunting season and not work for a month or two because it costs too much to werk they can make almost as much on food stamps and unemployment compensation as they can working and paying taxes as long as we h ave that kind of situation existing in this country we are going to have iflation and low productivity we have to make it possible for people to make more money and keep more of what they earn the same thing is true of the business community to be able to invest that capital to be able to retool modernize our industrial base to keep up with the japanese and germans and to also be able to have people see it pays more to work than it does to play so we have to have capital to solve our problems of productivity and productivity is one of the biggest solutions to our problem of inflation in the year 1980 according to an artide i read the other day in my home town newspaper taxes on a family making about 30 000 a year a family of four went up 25 percent by virtue of their federal tax burdensin 1 year 25 percent in 1965 only 7 percent of all of our taxpayers paid the marginal tax rate of more than 25 percent by 1977 that figure had grown from 7 percent to 30 percent of the american people who were paying more than this because of bracket creep and because of tax increase~s these dual perils are continuing to push more and miore of our taxpayers into higher tax brackets with no more real income to spend by virtue of inflation and these tax increases individuals need a tax break in this country they need it to be able to work harder they need it to be able to make ends meet and they need it out of a spirit of fairness but what i am contending goes beyond that we must have these tax cuts to actually make it possible for our economy to grow and to expand and to hire more people and take care of the people in this country who are less fortunate and have no opportuni ties as the gentleman spoke so eloquently about a mioment ago now if we look at what we have to vote on next tuesday and wednesd~ay in light of the need

confronting this nation and the world by their votes the people of this nation indicated they wanted a change in direction and this president offered a change he promised to try and reduce federal spending he promised to try to cut the destructive high inflation rate he promised to reduce the unwarranted and unnecessary federal interference in our daily lives with the help in some cases reluctant help of the 535 members of congress this president has made a new beginning he was not able to reduce federal spending but he did cut my more than half the request for increased federal spending he was not able to eliminate all the unnecessary redtape but he was able to reduce the number of pages of regulations printed in the federal register from 73 000 to 51 000 he was not able to end inflation but he did cut the rate which had been in double digit figures for most of the previous administration down to an annualized rate in the month of march of less than 4 percent for the past 5 or 6 months we have been provided with a consistent diet of bad news the morning newspaper headlines and the evening television news emphasize what they perceive to be wrong with the presidents program and ignore what many common folk perceive to be right with the presidents program nowhere has this consistent criticism of the reagan administration been more pernicious than it has been in the reports of central and latin america and particularly the reports from el salvador now i call your attention to some good news and to underscore the importance of this good news permit me to review in some detail what has been going on in el salvador mr speaker in land area this nation is about the size of your own state of massachusetts it is bordered by guatemala on the north honduras on the east and nicaragua on the southeast with about 135 miles of frontage on the pacific ocean about 5 million people live in el salvador el salvador became independent of spain in 1821 and of the central american federation in 1841 about 10 percent of the population is indian about 89 percent is of mixed spanish and indian blood and about 1 percent caucasian since achieving independence the salvadorans have in company with all of their neighbors struggled with a succession of authoritarian rulers and again like most of its neighbors there is both great wedlth and great poverty the political rulersclasping hands with the military or sometimes vise versahave attempted to maintain the status quo by preserving the privileges of the wealthy and preventing any upward mobility on the part of the poor but the thirst for freedom was not to be denied and in january 1931 in what most observers believe was a free election arturo araujo was elected president araujo had campaigned on a platform of better education better transportation and jobs for ordinary salvadorans and industrialization for the nation as a whole the new president had been educated at oxford he had seen the way in which class fluidity and mass prosperity had appeared in england after the industrial revolution he wanted to bring the benefits of an industrialized economy to his people the privileged class accustomed to using military power to protect their material possessions staged a coup led by the vice president gen maximiliano hernandez martinez the followers of hernandez sincerely believed the only way they could retain their riches was by keeping the majority of the people poor this quite naturally led to a belief on the part of the poor that the only way they could gain a better economic condition was to take the wealth from the rich neither side understood at all what arturo araujo had attempted to ac complish and quite naturally as they have in every other disturbed corner of the world the communists became active in el salvador their present leader is a man named shafik handal of palestinian ancestry in 1972 jose napoleon duarte was elected president defeating the candidate of the pcn partido de concilaclon nacional the political arm of el salvadors military this party had been ruling el salvador for about 40 years and they were not about to let a mere election change the course of events duarte was beaten and forced to flee the country in 1979 a group of young army officers ended the 45year rule of the pcn group deposed the present carlos humberto romero and duarteback from exilewas made president the government under duartes direction began to move toward land reform toward better economic and educational opportunities and toward a full democracy but of course their progress was not fast enough to please the marxists they wanted to rebuild salvadoran society on soviet and cuban models this then is the background of the struggle in el salvador john kurtwill a contributing editor of the national catholic register and editor of policy digest accuses the american press of romanticizing the guerilla forces and refusing to grant any credibility to the reforms attempted by president duarte it is estimated there are only about 5 000 leftist guerillas operating in el salvador guerillas who are receiving their arms from russia through cuba and nicaragua on the extreme right there are about 5 000 followers of the old regime this far right group would wipe out the land educational and economic programs of the duarte regime and return to the rigid military control of the past the far left wants to expropriate all the land nationalize all businesses and create a soviet state to accomplish this end they have waged relentless guerrilla warfare on the innocent people of el salvador one writer reviewing the salvadoran situation said the goal of terrorism all along has been to make the people cry out basta yaenough bring us peace no matter what you have to do would the establishment of a soviet model government in el salvador bring peace and dignity and opportunity to the salvadoran people what they aroidemanding is expropriation without right to indemnification of all properties in the hands of the oligarchy subsequent redistribution as collective communal or state properties management of the national economy on the basis of a system of national planning does this modus operandi of the soviet communists sound familiar we should keep in mind that such demands voiced by guerrillas in other lands have never brought peace justice or opportunity and if this is questioned we should solicit an answer from the poles from the afghans from the cubans and most recently from the nicaraguans now let us relate the good news the guerrillas called for and attempted to produce a nationwide strike this was to demonstrate to the leaders of el salvador that the guerrillas enjoyed the popular support of the people but the people refused to strikeeven though the guerrillas committed hideous acts such as murdering a businessman by mutilation who counseled his employees against striking the guerrillas are attempting to destroy what little economic strength remains in el salvador they wantonly destroy buses they blow up powerplants they dynamite roads is this to show their concern for the plight of the average salvadoran no it is not it is to intimidate the people but the good news is the people refused to be intimidated they did go to the polls they did vote they said we want a chance to determine our own destiny in a peaceful manner the elections in el salvador completely vindicated the policy of this administration we do not say the government in el salvador is perfect or not without fault but we do say and they helped to prove that the people of el salvador prefer ballots to bullets now let me direct your attention to those cassandras who have been pretending to see in el salvador a second vietnamridiculous consider the logistical differences vietnam was half the world away transport can reach el salvador by air in a few hours in vietnam the regulars of the north were a powerful disciplined military force easily supplied by the soviets through china the guerrillas in el salvador are small in number poorly trained and their supply routes could be easily interdicted i bring this up not to suggest that the united states should send troops to el salvador but to emphasize how ridiculous the claim that if we support the legitimate government in el salvadorthe only legitimate governmentit will lend to a prolonged 10year military involvement recently a resolution was offered it was suggested that the house of representatives urge the established government in el salvador to invite the guerrillas to join the government and to commerce negotiations for a political settlement this is essentially the same proposition being urged by mexico and france i voted against that proposal for the legitimate government of el salvadorparticularly now that it has been chosen in an open free electionto invite the leaders of the left to participate would be to legitimize the terrorists activity let those guerrillas who truly long for a betterment of conditions in el salvadoras individualsput down their arms and their bombs and go to work to improve the economy and to make democracy a reality i promised good news and there is good news in the american economy the reduction of the inflation rate is a remarkable accomplishment the presidents new and different attitude toward the role of the federal government in our everyday lives is a remarkable change we spent billions to create the great society and are we better off for all that public money spent the crime rate in evcry category is up we spent billions of public money in the war on poverty there is still great misery and poverty in this country the reagan administration understands that you cannot give somebody something without ultimately destroying the recipient of your gift the reagan administration is determined to get the government out of the way and to encourage the individuals to be responsible for their own destiny with an assist for all those who are genuinely incapable of caring for themselves as i go about the 4th district in arizona i find the people expressing new confidence and new hope sure things are difficult right now they say but it is going to be better when i visit the young people i find them sober and serious and determined to make progress on their own just this spring an amazing thing has occurred organized labor has voluntarily accepted a reduction in wages and fringe benefits in order to keep their industries in a better competitive position the presidents proposal to improve our defense capability is under constant attack in the media but the people i talk withthe workers and the taxpayers and the homeowners and the businessmenhave a clear understanding that in order to survive we must be strong last week one of my supporters and political advisers cautioned me about being too bold and forthright in my support of president reagan president reagans popularity is way down you know he said the polls tell us so a great many people do not approve of what he is doing it would be better if you talked more about eldon rudd and less about ronald reagan well my friends ronald reagan is the only leader we have who has demonstrated an understanding of the problems which confront us and a determination to do something about them he is taking his lumps in the press but on the scorecard that really countsthat is the one kept in the heart of every loyal americani think ronald reagan is earning high marks and because i believe he is right when he says we must reduce taxeswe must reduce federal spendingwe must reduce federal regulationi shall continue to support him at every opportunity because i too believe those things are right for this nation the american

the struggle for freedom and yet even today as we celebrate bill of rights day and human rights day we all arb only too well aware that the individual rights do clared in these documents are not yet
